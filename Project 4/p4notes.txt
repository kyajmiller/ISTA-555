Training vs Testing Data:
First 2/3 of original file (49750 lines) = training
25628 lines = testing

Preprocessing
Tokenization - tokenize on whitespace, filter out urls (startswith http://) 
filter out twitter handles
filter out floating punctuation
remove punctuation from ends of words

Training
based on the state, tag each feature set with liberal/conservative 
don't want the machine to make a correlation between the state itself and the label
so even though want to keep the state label, make the machine predict political
affiliation based on the tweet alone, then after done gather together all of the 
results by state and then use those results to predict if the state itself is 
liberal/conservative (probably based on which result is most common)
