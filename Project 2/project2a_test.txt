1	date released : varies running length : 1 : 33 rated : nc-17 ( graphic violence , language , nudity , rape ) starring : remy belvaux , benoit poelvoorde , andre bonzei director : remy belvaux producers : belvaux , poelvoorde , and bonzei screenplay : belvaux , poelvoorde , bonzei , and vincent tavier released by roxie releasing french with english subtitles as a short , this could have been a brilliant , blistering satire on society's views of violence and how it relates to movies . however , man bites dog is a full-length feature and , as such , spends a little too much time with its subject . thirty minutes , or even forty-five , would have been a perfect length , but by the end of the third half-hour , certain elements of this movie ( namely ben's endless philosophizing ) have grown tired . the violence has lost its edge and the movie has begun to meander . nevertheless , despite the possibly-excessive length , there is still a lot to praise in this obscure effort by a trio of previously-unknown belgian film makers . they have taken violence in the cinema to its ultimate limit and created an always-irreverent , often darkly funny look at killers and victims . every moment of this film is shot documentary-style in grainy black-and-white . this pseudo-realism , complete with choppy editing and unsteady , hand-held camera shots , gives an eerie air of legitimacy to man bites dog . the film makers are remy and andre , and the killer is benoit . benoit possesses an especially interesting personae . heartless as a killer , he's actually a fun guy to be around most of the time . he's smart and thoughtful , often giving lengthy discourses on various aspects of life and death . at first , it's just little things like shining a light in a certain spot , but it doesn't take long before they're actually joining in . at one time or another , comparisons have been made between this film and a couple of other recent , gut-wrenching productions--henry : portrait of a serial killer and reservoir dogs . from my point-of-view , while there are superficial similarities between these pictures and man bites dog , the basic thrust is radically different . reservoir dogs and henry are both serious movies . man bites dog approaches itself and its subject with tongue planted firmly in cheek . one of the most hilarious moments in the film comes when ben has a shoot-out with another killer . dark , twisted humor like this characterizes man bites dog . the limited budget of the film shows , but in a way that adds to the genuine feel of what we're seeing . the plot has a couple of twists that allow us to see various emotions from all of the principals of man bites dog . nevertheless , through the entire movie , the only character to be effectively developed is that of the killer , ben . obviously not a movie for everyone , man bites dog boasts graphic displays of murder and rape . there's very little of the human body--inside or out--that isn't shown at one time or another during the course of this movie . nevertheless , if you do venture to see man bites dog , you would have to be made out of stone to miss the visceral , sardonic impact of a highly-unusual film . 
1	there are moments when the relic is almost enjoyable , albeit in a visceral sort of way . unfortunately , when all is said and done , this horror/science fiction amalgamation seems like nothing more ambitious than a bad reworking of elements from aliens , species , jaws , and predator . except for the choice of protagonists and the setting , there's nothing remotely new here . director peter hyams ( one of the few film makers to act as his own cinematographer ) , who once helmed sean connery in outland , manages to occasionally elevate the tension to a level that arrests the audience's attention , but it doesn't lead to anything worthwhile . the ending is a classic example of deus ex machina -- a sudden , unexpected turn-of- events that leaves movie-goers shaking their heads sadly and wondering why the screenwriters couldn't have thought up something more reasonable and satisfying . the second half of the movie , which is by far the most energetic , involves a gala celebration at the museum that turns into a bloodbath when the creature gets loose and starts beheading people and sucking out their brains . while these may have been important plot aspects of the novel upon which the relic is based , all they manage to accomplish here is to add minutes to the running time without providing any valuable insight into what's going on . to borrow a term , the relic is basically designed as a " bug hunt " ; attempts to make it anything more intelligent or interesting fail . penelope ann miller definitely isn't classic action heroine material . she looks nice in a slinky black dress and can let out a pretty decent scream , but she's too petite to get involved in any face- to-face combat . i suppose these two deserve credit for maintaining such a level of earnestness amidst all the cliches . this kind of movie has a built-in audience , although it's not clear how large that audience is . we've seen so many variations on this same story that it's gradually losing whatever appeal it once held . the relic isn't the film to inject new life into the sub-genre . instead , this is just the latest attempt to milk a mostly-dry formula , and the result is what you might expect -- a slick , gory motion picture with lots of cheap shocks , including the obligatory cat jumping out of the darkness . such a poor payoff is hardly a good reason to shell out the price of admission at the box office . 
2	a few jumped into the sea only to be shot underwater while attempting to remove their heavy packs . as the wise captain john miller , the man whose unit has almost vanished , tom hanks gives the most reserved performance of his career - reserved , but no less brilliant . why this is a mystery is a mystery in itself . mild mannered but self-assured john miller doesn't look like a man who would want or need to hide his past . saving private ryan is director steven spielberg's best film since schindler's list . a moving war picture that takes neither an overly pacifist nor patriotic approach , it avoids shameless manipulation of the audience's emotions . the war itself is shown so realistically that the reaction of many viewers may be similar to mine . i wanted to go to a private corner and cry my eyes out after the movie finished . they argue that they have mothers too . john william's heroic music for the film is sweeping in its grandeur , yet never overwhelms the more delicate moments . schindler's list's academy award winning cinematographer janusz kaminski is as good in the intimate moments as the dramatic ones . finally , kaminski uses the handheld camera to good effect during the battle sequences . as it bounces up and down , you can feel the jitters of the fighting men , and the chaos of the battle . between scenes that take your breath away , robert rodat's script is smart enough to throw in a little much-needed humor . watching men necessarily reduced to animals fighting for survival may be hard to watch , but this film of spielberg's is movie making at its best . it is an experience sometimes hard to endure but not to be missed . it is rated r for profanity and strong violence and would be fine for mature teenagers . 
1	indeed , the musical numbers are the film's best part , even if none come close to being memorable . mitchell kriegman's script is the movie's weakest link , giving the film slightly less punch than a typical television episode from the series . in our packed audience , filled with kids from toddlers on up , the laugh quotient was remarkably modest . typical of the picture's humor is the location of the villain's home -- it's " high atop mount pick-a-nose . " kriegman throws the adults in the audience a few random funny lines . with its 3 to 5-year-old target audience , the movie stops the action , literally , whenever anything threatening occurs . also interactive , the movie requires audience participation , lest bad things happen to its protagonist . elmo , for example , needs us to come up with 100 raspberries in less than 30 seconds to convince the queen of trash ( vanessa l . williams ) that he isn't a cohort of the nefarious huxley ( mandy patinkin ) . the movie keeps a dynamic count on the screen , so you may want to practice in advance . even if the film isn't all it could be , some scenes are special . the most magical is one filled with fireflies . it is rated g and would be fine for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 10 , gave it * * , liking mainly the music . his friend alan , age 10 , gave it * * * , finding the movie hilarious but the plot weak . 
2	director ron howard is a master craftsman at taking the viewer into another profession - remember how you felt the terror of being a fireman in backdraft ? you and your colleagues have a half a day to get the front page story right and scoop your competition . the movie starts at a good clip , but by the end , you are on a roller coaster ride as the background investigative reporting just is not happening fast enough to get to the 8pm press run . by the end , your heart is racing . wonderful images as the building actually shakes every time the big presses run . although not technically realistic perhaps , it remains a perfect metaphor . at a surface level , the paper is a comedy . i laughed out loud constantly . the script is extremely funny and michael keaton , as the metro editor , delivers the lines as only he can . you feel like you are there and arguing with them . this story within the larger story was touching and had me crying some by the end . you see , i think the movie ultimately is not a comedy - although it is extremely funny . this is a first rate drama . it simultaneously made me want to work day and night for a newspaper like this to get out the daily big story while at the same time it made me want to take it easy and enjoy my family as the only thing in life that really matters . okay , it is not perfect . in real life , this could get you in big trouble . i did not buy that part of the plot . the scene by the presses works great in the movie but would never happen that way in the real world . but , this is a movie and a darn good one . if i just wanted to see real life , i would have gone to the mall . it is rated r , but i thought it should have been pg-13 . certainly everyone above the age of say 10 should love it . i give it * * * 1/2 and strongly recommend it to you . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : april 1 , 1994 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	the sophomore jinx strikes again ! schaeffer is one-half of the duo responsible for 1994's quirky , often-hilarious my life's in turnaround . harry and sally seemed like real people -- they connected with each other and the audience . the same certainly can't be said about lucy and joe . these two are cardboard cut-outs , and the only thing we feel for them is apathy . for the most part , if lucy fell is a disappointingly superficial romantic comedy . there's no chemistry between any of the characters . the acting is mediocre , with schaeffer and parker exhibiting no screen presence . the result is that this film , which wants to be smart , funny , and hip , succeeds instead in being mostly irritating . and the far-too-predictable ending is both contrived and manipulative . after my life's in turnaround , one could reasonably expect something more than this -- a generation x picture that takes angst to absurd levels -- from eric schaeffer . unfortunately , what we are saddled with is a whiney , talky , stagnant movie that's more pretentious than romantic , and more dull than funny . if lucy fell trips early on , and keeps stumbling for most of its ninety-two minute running length . 
1	distilled to its purest essence , cadillac ranch is a traditional road picture featuring female characters -- a kinder , gentler thelma and louise . all the conventions of the genre are present , from the wild car chases to the protagonists' bonding . what makes it all worthwhile is not that jennifer cecil's script is a marvel of originality , but that the three main characters are fun , likable gals who make the whole 100-minute adventure entertaining . there's nothing particularly deep or challenging about cadillac ranch , but the simple story supports three solid characters and a dose of effective humor . when the drama works , it does so because the characters seem real . cadillac ranch is beautifully photographed , but it isn't an acting clinic . linden ashby is sporadically effective , and renee humphrey tends to be a little too perky for her own good . christopher lloyd plays the bad guy with cartoonish gusto , and james metzler is suitably heroic as " every girl's fantasy man . " ultimately , however , cadillac ranch doesn't need oscar-caliber performances . even though they're only portrayed adequately , cj , frances , and mary katherine still make enjoyable road companions . 
0	a fast-paced film noir about corruption and double-crosses , that has a lot of plot twists and a nifty surprise ending . the film was cheaply made and the acting didn't distinguish itself . but the story had a lot of snap to it . it's not a bad watch , but lovers of film noir should like it more than others . 
1	it is a comedy/documentary/horror movie . i smiled from the opening credits where they told you it was a true story till the last credit where they reassured you that " no flies were injured or killed in the making of the film . " whew ! i was worried until those ending credits . i never laughed out loud , but i kept a constant grin on my face from ear to ear . remember ozzie and harriet ? well , this time harriet is cuter than ever , but she is a serial killer . looking at this family , it was hard not wanting to be a part of it . you had to keep reminding yourself that no matter how sweet the mom seemed , she was a serial killer after all . great cameo roles too by suzanne thighmasters summers and patty lets-rob-a-bank hearst . the movie was filmed in bright lights and vivid primary colors by robert stevens and robert m . stevens . the music by basil poledouris was continual sweetness and happiness . it really set the tone well . equal to turner's performance was john waters's direction . i have seen none of these and had it not been for the wonderful trailers i saw ahead of time , i think i never would have seen serial mom because i hate slap stick comedy , but this was a highly controlled comedy - certainly not slap stick . okay , so what is wrong with it ? it was way overboard too gory . other than that , which cost the movie a half star in my ratings , i found no other faults . waters does exactly what he sets out to do , and turner delivers a terrific performance . less cuteness and bigger laughs would have help get it another 1/2 star from me . the sight gags made you smile , but the dialog rarely elicited laughter . it is rate r for the intense gore . teenagers can probably handle the movie fine . i rate it * * 1/2 and recommend you see it but be prepared to look away when during the bloody scenes . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	i'm not a fan of glam rock , my musical partialities are more in the line for classical music or '60s rock . glam is the kind of music that is pretty to look at for short periods of time but when more closely scrutinized could turn ugly . that is both the virtue and problem with this entertaining and stylish celebration of the rock music scene by todd haynes ( safe/poison ) , that has the right musical feel but offers no depth and little character development in its story . this fictionalized story is a thin disguise for david bowie's bio , and it was able along the way to rip-off the citizen kane way of telling a biography in a fictionalized way . and if that weren't enough of a splash in the water of cause c ? l ? bre , haynes throws a bit of the oscar wilde biography into the fiction presented . the film works best as a music video and if you like the music , you'll probably love the film . as a film it was a colorful spectacle , wonderfully performed , very energetic , and it had some witty dialogue ; but , it failed to tell a cohesive story and failed to capture what that period of the 1970s was about . it was hard to tell what haynes was trying to expose or tell about this fictionalized bowie-ziggy stardust-like character . it was all vague and superficial , i suppose , just like glamor is . besides , i don't really know how worthwhile it is to uncover his mystery life-like who cares ! anyway , he wasn't made into an interesting character by slade's characterization of him-i think david bowie is a much more interesting character than brian slade . if you don't mind having an empty feeling after seeing a film , then this one could be your kind of nourishment . the suggestion made was that these performers are role models and influence many teens-for good or bad . unfortunately , the film did not pick up on that thread of the story , as it continued on in its glitzy musical style . curt , " if you don't look at the world . " i guess something must have happened to the two performing artists along the way , but it must have happened offscreen , because it didn't happen onscreen . 
1	producers : taylor hackford and charles mulvehill . director : taylor hackford . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 134 minutes . be prepared to be sorely disappointed if you go to proof of life expecting to see the " sparks a-flyin' between meg and russell show . " as has been well-reported by entertainment news outlets , co-stars meg ryan and russell crowe got a little thing going while filming proof of life . it's the kind of story that provides publicity a studio just can't buy , with voyeuristic viewers potentially taking the opportunity to watch a filmed record of two attractive stars developing a major league case of the hots for one another . as it happens , the relationship between ryan and crowe's characters is the worst reason to see proof of life . in fact , the filmmakers seem to do everything possible to make that relationship utterly inconsequential . there are two major co-conspirators in the failure of proof of life's romantic angle : the timidity of director taylor hackford , and the casting of meg ryan . the script by tony gilroy does a fine job of setting up cracks in the bowman's marriage , the kind that could easily lead to some straying during a pressure-packed situation . ryan , meanwhile , never develops into a complete character , with a back story that's made up of script assertions rather than performance . in a role like this , opposite a dynamic screen actor like crowe , it becomes obvious that meg ryan is a movie star in a role that demands an actor . while proof of life's major selling point sits there limply in the center of the film , there's plenty of great stuff going on around the perimeter . morse , a superb character actor who seems only to be getting better with age , gets some wonderful scenes as he tries to cope with his situation . there's more great material surrounding the details of terry's profession , including his friendship with a colleague played by david caruso ( in a performance so vivid it just makes you want to cry over his career choices ) . and there's crowe himself , whose charisma boosts the intensity of every scene he's in . as a film about the psychological pressures of retrieving a hostage , proof of life scores . it may seem unfair to drag the actors' personal lives into an evaluation of a film , but it's obvious from what's not on the screen that the film itself was ultimately compromised by those personal lives . it doesn't . the genuine shame is that it's such a strong piece of work in virtually every other respect that it's still worth watching . proof of life will be a more enjoyable experience for you if you go in expecting a thriller rather than an incendiary screen romance -- especially when the filmmakers keep trying to blow out the flames . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
2	brazil/portugal , 1995 running length : 1 : 40 mpaa classification : no mpaa /96 cast : fernanda torres , fernando alves pinto , laura cardoso , luis melo , alexandre borges , joao lagarto , tcheky karyo directors : walter salles and daniela thomas screenplay : walter salles and daniela thomas cinematography : walter carvalho music : jose miguel wisnik in portugese and spanish with subtitles a foreign land , which catapults its characters from brazil to portugal , is a black-and-white thriller that recalls brazil's cinema nuovo . using various requisite elements of traditional film noir in an atypical setting -- the femme fatale , the heroic-but-clueless hero , the stolen goods , and the cold-hearted villains , this movie is more engrossing than it perhaps has a right to be . there's nothing especially magical or momentous about a foreign land , but , after a shaky setup , it manages to grip an audience for the balance of its running length . much of the first half of a foreign land is slow and disjointed . we get to know the characters , but wonder if anything interesting is ever going to happen . during this part of the film , there's also a painfully obvious plot device that has one of the characters selling a passport . once the movie reaches its narrative meat , however , it quickly becomes involving and suspenseful . aided by stark black-and-white cinematography and crisp dialogue , the second half of a foreign land is about as good as modern film noir gets . the political background and international settings are what differentiate a foreign land from most other low-budget thrillers . the usage of sao paolo and lisbon as locations is a lot fresher than , say , new york and london . the result is that , while a foreign land doesn't strike out in any amazingly new directions , it adds enough unique dashes to a familiar genre to captivate an audience . 
2	" executions 'r us " could read the business card of fred a . leuchter jr . , the engrossing subject of errol morris's latest documentary , mr . his camerawork choices are both beautiful and insightful . and he manages to find humor without ever resorting to cheap shots and to make the potentially repugnant absolutely riveting . in a film with two distinct but seamless parts , morris presents us with the life of engineer leuchter . through this he developed an interest in prisons , specifically executions . " i was very concerned about the humanitarian aspects of death by torture , " leuchter explains . before leuchter came along , electric chairs were generally built by inmates or electricians , not based on any blueprint or design but on seeing a picture of some other state's old electric chair . this led to some pretty horrific executions when the chair did not serve its intended purpose of putting a person to death as quickly and as painlessly as possible . " i am a proponent of capital punishment , " leuchter tell us . " i am not a proponent of capital torture . " the movie is at it's most convincing when it easily disproves leuchter's disproof of the annihilation of the jews . his descent proves more rapid than his ascent . morris's gripping film tells a fascinating story of a little man who let his accomplishments inflate his ego until it burst . it is rated pg-13 for mature themes and would be fine for teenagers . 
2	finally , there's a legitimate challenge to disney . and , while it's unlikely that twentieth century fox's anastasia will break the mouse's stranglehold on animated films , it's a good place to start . anastasia is easily the best non-disney animated movie in recent memory , and it is good enough to rival such titles as the lion king and aladdin . the key is enjoyability and appeal to both adults and children . this degree of magic and energy has been noticeably absent in movies like pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and hercules . the first thing to note about this delightful animated adventure is that it should not be confused with an historical account of the russian revolution . aside from borrowing a few names , facts , and dates , this is pure , unadulterated fantasy . someone expecting even a loose reliance upon history is going to be horrified , but then anyone who falls into that category probably doesn't belong at this movie in the first place . even moreso than pocahontas , anastasia uses reality as nothing more than a convenient backdrop . while the animation in anastasia still doesn't quite match up to that of disney's recent features , it's light years ahead of the likes of the land before time , balto , and even an american tail ( also by anastasia's director , former disney animator don bluth ) . there are times when the characters' lips don't perfectly synch up with the vocals , and other occasions when the background detail is lacking , but , on the whole , anastasia's visual pallet is quite rich . many of the most complex sequences are majestic , and effective use is made of computer generated effects and background paintings . consider , for example , an impressive view of a shining st . petersburg as anastasia approaches it from over a hill . story-wise , anastasia is every bit as strong as any new wave disney film except beauty and the beast . there's a little adventure , a little romance , a little mysticism , and a little drama . the lead character is easily the strongest , most independent animated female to grace the screen , surpassing even belle for spunk . meg ryan is perfect for this role . anastasia's love interest , dimitri , isn't very interesting , although john cusack gives him a spark of personality . the villain , rasputin , looks hideous , but his nastiness is relatively generic . musically , anastasia is better than anything from disney since death deprived them of their key lyricist , howard ashman . all of the big production numbers in anastasia have their roots in broadway musicals , with a lot of well-choreographed dancing and singing . it's interesting to note that , of those who have speaking parts , only kelsey grammer , bernadette peters , and angela lansbury are allowed to do their own singing . the whole process of watching anastasia is a thoroughly enjoyable one , and it proves that any studio willing to put forth the time , money , and effort can match disney . in fact , understandably , a lot of kids will mistake anastasia for the mouse's latest offering . twentieth century fox should consider this a compliment , not a slight . if every non-disney animated film in production or on the drawing board is as good as anastasia , the executives at the magic kingdom have good reason to worry . " for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake . " 
1	starring : taylor nichols , chris eigeman , tushka bergen , mira sorvino , pep munne . screenplay/director : whit stillman . i remember missing whit stillman's metropolitan when it was in theaters in 1990 , and eagerly awaiting its video release . i had heard stillman compared to woody allen , and i've always been a sucker for urbane banter . but i was disappointed with metropolitan ; pithy dialogue only goes so far without any real story . barcelona is a step in the right direction , but just a step . there is more substance unifying stillman's clever observations , but barcelona will still come off as far too slow and talky for many viewers , a 100 minute long new yorker cartoon with a view . where metropolitan suffered from too many characters too sketchily drawn , barcelona wisely narrows its focus . both performances are extremely strong , but unfortunately both characters are a bit annoying . with significant stretches of barcelona consisting almost entirely of conversations between ted and fred , their prep school petulance grows tiresome , and you begin to wish for absolutely anything to _happen_ to these guys . when it does , it's a welcome change of pace . if there is one thing stillman does know how to do , it's how to load his films with quotable lines . ted has a sharp little monologue about why he has decided only to date " plain , or even rather homely " women ( a resolution he promptly breaks ) ; fred counters with observations on his confusion over the correct way to shave , as well as why american society is mis-perceived as more violent ( " we're just better shots " ) . there are a number of moments which prompt genuine laughs , but stillman doesn't seem to know how to incorporate them into a plot . everything comes to a halt so that his characters can trade bon mots , and it begins to seem as though stillman has simply set up his camera in front of an expatriate version of the algonquin round table . when he does pull out some quirky , character-based physical comedy , like ted cutting a rug to " pennsylvania 6-5000 " while reading the bible , it's as though he's jolted the entire production to life with a cattle prod . only eventually it settles back into wry philosophizing . barcelona does manage some keen insights into european perceptions about american society and politics , and when stillman focuses his attention on that theme he is frequently on target . his most perceptive observation connects the attitudes of europeans towards american tastes to the miserable quality of hamburgers abroad , and it was one of those rare movie moments where i saw the world , if only briefly , through different eyes . that achievement alone warrants praise , and a moderate recommendation . but i sense there will be many viewers who will grow restless waiting for stillman's characters to get a life . barcelona is just clever enough to get by on its charm , but stillman really needs to stop wallowing in his own cleverness and start telling stories . 
2	lynn hershman leeson is the director/writer of an intriguing cyber-fantasy film . it is a film that is strong on ideas about artificial life , memory , and immortality ; and , in the innovative technology it uses to convey its virtual reality story by using the latest in cutting edge technology , such as digital software photoshop programs . the film was structured around the idea of a double helix to be visualized in every scene and shot by using a dna image as a model for the actors' placement and camera movement . the actors appeared before nothing but a bluescreen and were photographed with a digital betacam and this was then transferred to computer images depicting the same victorian bed-and-breakfast rooms where ada byron king actually resided , the actors and the authentic rooms were then seen together in the live video . the film is much weaker on its drama than on its technology , as its characters seem to pale a bit besides the computerized images of artificial life that it created . nevertheless , for computer geeks , this is a definite must see ; for others , it should be of considerable interest to the more intellectual-minded who like to see something different for a change in a film , in a film that also has the ability to challenge the usual concepts of what reality is thought to be . as envisioned by ada , this information can lead to composing music and creating a poetic language . one of his pearls of wisdom goes something like this , " information is like a mist that you have to breathe in . " the concept offered in this film , of the possibility to retreat to the past for communication with historical figures and to gather information from stored memory , is an alluring idea and is certainly one that gives this intelligently made film a highbrow premise worth savoring . what weakness' there are to the story , come about from its complications in its storytelling and the didactic way it explains so much of its mathematical theory to an audience that needs this vital information made clear in order to help them make sense out of what is taking place-- but this ruins the entertainment value of the film and curtails its natural flow . as a result , that very riveting performance of a first-class actress , one of the very best , the illuminated tilda swinton ( orlando ) , is overshadowed by the film's inability to be more energetically engaging , though some effort was made to bring more life and passion into the story by showing both emmy's and ada's sexual passions unfold . but the story couldn't completely connect with all the characters involved and bring out their side of the story . if the film remained more focused on ada's story and we understood her work a little bit more , and if we saw why babbage got credit for the invention not her , it would have been in all probability an even better film . swinton is that good of a performer to have carried this film further if given more camera time . the film's ingenuous structure and imaginative nature suffered some dents because it misplaced its focus , not staying with the part of the story that was truly unique and inspiring . yet for those on the lookout for a brainy non-hollywood film , one that has an original flare to it , this one should prove to be more than satisfactory . 
2	indeed , his manner with her borders on outright insolence , but such treatment seems to be exactly what the queen needs to rouse her from her gloom . brown had been a love story , it would be a pretty poor excuse for one . jeremy brock's script offers far too few scenes between the two principles , providing very little sense of the basis for those rumors ; their relationship is as much a rumor to viewers of the film as to the scandal-mongers it portrays . victoria's devotion to brown remains unexplored , the feelings of both parties purely a matter of conjecture . brown isn't a love story at all . instead , it's a drama of political intrigue , both on a national scale and within the queen's own household . the monarchy is no longer inviolate in the eyes of the public , the idea of abolishing it no longer heretical . brown is quite effective as a portrait of rumor as political lever , as well as the changing perception of monarchy . brown works as a companion piece to another recent film about the british crown in turmoil , the madness of king george -- think of this one as the sadness of queen victoria . the household politics are less clearly drawn , due largely to the uneven characterization of brown . brown refuses to suffer fools of any social station , a quality which is both his greatest asset and his greatest fault . his motivations , however , fluctuate too frequently -- at times he seems self-serving , at other times insanely devoted to victoria . it is antony sher's performance as disraeli which really makes mrs . brown worth watching , capturing the work of a consummate politician in an era when consummate politicians were few and far between . brown were half as compelling behind the doors of balmoral castle as it is behind the doors of parliament , it could have been as fine a romantic tragedy as it is a piece of political theater . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " .

1	( dildos of many colors and sizes , which appear in the film in profusion , apparently are legal , as are the many other sex toys that serve as props in this sexual romp . ) the plot is actually fairly irrelevant in this character-driven story . but the movie makes maggie , rather than kim , the one that makes the first move . all of the characters have their little stories to tell . a treasure trove of sex toys that she finds under maggie's bed serves up one of the funniest and , for lila and the audience , one of the most satisfying scenes . judy performs at a nightclub , in which the performers sing and dance to a host of fun numbers -- the best being " julie christy makes me so misty . " it would have been better left for another movie in which it could be explored with more depth and seriousness . it is in the erotic romance and the quirky comedy that the audiences will find enjoyment and pleasure in better than chocolate . better than chocolate runs 1 : 41 . it is not rated but would be r or nc-17 for strong , explicit sex and nudity and for language and violence . the film isn't appropriate for teens , except for the oldest and most mature . 
1	inspired by the 1994 novel by william trevor , this is a film about a serial killer that promised to be more inspiring than it turned out , even though it is an excellently crafted film and has more to offer than the usual serial killer film does . it , somehow , takes a familiar journey down this director's path even if it seems the director is drifting off into foreign territory . the innovative canadian of armenian descent , atom egoyan , who has in the past covered such familiar themes as he does here , revisits the themes of betrayal , familial ills , religious conflicts , sexual secrets , videotapes , and uncertain identities . bob hoskins performance is brilliantly mannered , even if he chews the scenery to gain such control , but , nevertheless , he is engaging as a manipulative predator and someone who could be both charming and frightening . what fails this otherwise competent and worthwhile production , is that everything falls too easily into psychological place by the film's end . we are led to believe we understand too much about this serial killer and that he can be redeemed , but the reality is , that we understand too little about him , despite the appropriate effort that is made to understand him . when the nature of the relationship hoskins has in mind with felicia becomes obvious , the film can't recover from this knowledge and it becomes more natural for the audience to care that the angelic cassidy somehow survives what is intended her , rather than the film going into deeper and more unfamiliar ground . this serial killer film falls below the achievements of m and peeping tom , as it falls into the range of films that miss their mark but are still enriching . 
0	other movies make guest appearances as well . this is a comedy , whose one joke consists of two guys bobbing their heads to the film's wonderfully energetic music . the joke wears thin very fast . if so , then you are likely part of the target audience for a night at the roxbury . most viewers , however , will find it a film with a few genuine good laughs but not many . filmed by francis kenny in grainy , over-saturated colors , the movie has a cheap appearance that looks almost like it was shot on videotape and later transferred to film stock . in a film that works best at the physical comedy , the brother's dancing style comes straight from the nfl playbook for offensive tackles . " if i said you had a nice body , " asks one of their dates . " would you hold it against me ? " if you've seen the movie's annoying trailers , you've already seen the best parts . compared to a night at the roxbury , the sporadically funny mafia ! from earlier this summer is a comedic masterpiece . this much is certain . after you leave the theater , even if you forget most of the lame humor , which is likely , the music will stay with you . buy the cd and skip the movie . it is rated pg-13 for brief nudity , sexual situations , and a little profanity and would be fine for kids 12 and up .

1	the heroine in this wacky autobiography learns the hard way that it pays to be unique , even if that might require an acceptance of her being unhappy , if the alternative is , that happiness means that you have to be like everyone else . " slums " is a sharp-witted , biting screwball comedy about a semi-dysfunctional family who have some problems that prevents them from being a happy family but not the kind of problems that can't be overcome . her wide-eyed and aghast looks at what she sees happening to her are what give this film its particular flavor and her comical and sad observations are right-on-target . murray is a brash , intrusive , and insensitive single-parent , who means well but overextends his good intentions and fails to see his mistakes in time . tomei gives a wonderfully over-the-top performance as a lost soul , who brings her quirky antics into a household that is trying to act like " people " but can't seem to make it . this scene was funny but it was also very hurtful to watch . it touched on all the nerves that made this into an intense dramatic scene , that worked so well because the script was tight and the actors were well-cast , with especially natasha lyonne , as the girl who was always being surprised as she tries to find out who she is . a small gem of a film , much better than the sitcom material it portends to be . 
0	a sometimes engaging indie film about three best friends growing up in nyc , that is a heartfelt story but is hampered by its awkward dialogue and unfulfilling plot . all these characters seemed contrived and left the film feeling flat , though comedy burst forth from time to time . the best conversations are between danny and stan , and give the pic its intellectual stimulus and reason for being . " went to coney island " never got untracked , though it had some bright dramatic moments and some perceptive comic offerings , but it could never come together as a complete picture . it was also done in by a needless subplot of stan getting into gambling debts and being beaten , which just seemed like padding to a thin story . too much of the film seemed to have no place to go , just like misinformed tourists who go to coney in the winter to see the idle cyclone ride . 
2	it is a sad and melancholic film full of great dramatic music ( juergen knieper ) filled with violins that added immensely to the intensity of the emotions . refreshing to see religion as a force for good albeit her attempts were all total failures . lots of misty eyes in the audience . the director and the cinematographer ( franz rath ) knew just how to handle it in a simple and controlled fashion . the acting by the four actors playing the two leads is phenomenal as is the direction . i was very moved by this picture . it forms wonderful images in your subconscious that stay with you . this is a movie about love kept . although it has many a tragic scene , the ultimate message made me feel like i had just heard beethoven's ode to joy being sung - very uplifting . the fine script ( felice laudadio , peter schneider , margarethe von trotta ) develops what could have easily been a complex and long movie into an accessible and standard length film . the characters are all ones that the audience cares about , and by the end , dry eyes are to come by . and yet the script never manipulates the audience , rather it approaches the story in a remarkable low key fashion . the east is shown to be full of orwellian logic . so there too was a happy ending . the promise reminded me somewhat of the unbearable lightness of being which is certainly a compliment , but the promise is a unique show thanks to the script and the artful direction of margarethe von trotta . the casting is excellent . konrad was not quite as close , but very similar . in an american production , we would have spent a ton of money and had the actors spend hours every day getting made to look older through makeup . i liked von trotta's different actors approach . the promise runs just 1 : 59 but manages to cover thirty years with perfect pacing . you will never be bored nor will you feel cheated that they are trying to cram too much stuff in . the film is in german with easy to follow english subtitles , and it is rated r . although it does have brief nudity and a little sex , i can not remember any violence . it would be fine for absolutely any teenager . i strongly recommend this film to you . if you are at all interested in love or history , you must see this film . it will touch your heart as it did mine . finally , i award it * * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : january 31 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	two things could be said for sure about this movie , which uses mostly nonprofessional actors , that it is disturbingly romantic and it is troublingly inconclusive . there is no telling narrative to sink one's teeth into the story , but the visceral images and the emptiness of the youth's quest are fully explored in an original way , by the first-time director , manuel pradal . metaphors abound in this film , so much so that one could overdose on all the heavily intended poetical images and still not find much to sate one's hunger for what this film is ultimately about , which becomes the film's major fault . if you want something that is predictable about this unpredictable film , you have it here , you can bet your popcorn money that before the film is over some innocent kid will get it . if you want to read some politics into this film , you might say that the director was using the local american navy base as a metaphor , showing the mixed-reaction it gets from the locals , as he tried to get at what the local reactions to the base are by showing that there is an undercurrent of disrespect and lack of trust for each other . the mystery about them , gives them a camus-like sense of existentialism , it is as if the more modern the story tries to be , the more it can be seen rooted in an old philosophy , a philosophy of fatalism . the beauty in the film is from the never stopping camerawork , picking up one beautiful scene after another , though what connection this all has to do with the movie is anyone's guess . as i thought this film was about loners versus the group psychology prevailing , whereas the loners can't function with any kind of social measure because their troubling souls can find no place in modern french society to fit in . the trouble with that pat explanation of the film , is that the film doesn't help itself any by overloading the imagery , so that if one wanted to , there could by many other explanations for what the film was about . after a certain point , that becomes an annoying feature of the film , as the two teens lose their humanity and seem to be only symbols for what the director was trying to say . this is possible because of there persistent silence and lack of character development . aside from being a stunning film to watch , i could see no beauty in its dark character portrayal of the lovers and the film's overall pessimistic attitudes toward youth . the film had too many missing ingredients in it for it to be impactful ; i could hardly remember the main characters just a week later after seeing the film , only remembering how alluring vahina giocante was and how beautiful the south of france looks . 
0	fathers' day simply has to be seen to be believed . it's beyond my comprehension how a motion picture with so much talent associated with it -- actors robin williams and billy crystal , super-producer joel silver , and director ivan reitman -- can be such a complete waste of time . fathers' day isn't just bad , it's awful . without a doubt , this is one of 1997's most disappointing motion pictures . on the surface , the film looks like it could be good . in fact , williams and crystal might not even need a script -- just the two of them on camera together should be enough to garner laughs . as it turns out , that would have been a better approach , because the screenplay for fathers' day , written by feel-good scribes lowell ganz and babaloo mandel ( multiplicity , city slickers ) , saps all life and humor from the leads' performances . the painful , predictable result is a dearth of mirth . if you see fathers' day and laugh more than once , consider yourself lucky . fathers' day wants to be a hilarious , screwball comedy that doubles as a buddy film , with a dash of family values thrown in for good measure . fathers' day is a one-hundred minute bore without a single character worth caring about . crystal and williams generate no chemistry , and both look like they're on hand solely to pick up a paycheck . the feel-good moments , which are available in embarrassing abundance , border on nauseating . however , perhaps the most disheartening thing about fathers' day is its complete lack of energy -- even williams' patented manic impressions come across as more scripted than spontaneous . with the addition of fathers' day to his uneven resume , film maker ivan reitman can now boast " the ugly " in addition to " the good " and " the bad . " as a director , reitman has been responsible for several entertaining movies , including ghostbusters and dave , and an even larger number of mediocre-to-poor offerings , such as the arnold schwarzenegger comedies ( twins , kindergarten cop , junior ) . but nothing he has previously accomplished equals this travesty . hopefully , fathers' day will be nothing more than an unpleasant memory by the time the third sunday in june rolls around . 
1	it's rather interesting--and a little discouraging--that the bulk of theatrical science fiction is actually far better suited to the action genre than to anything else . timecop is a perfect example . as a shoot- 'em-up , blast-'em-to-pieces film , it's not half bad . as a futuristic time travel movie , however , it has some very serious problems . nevertheless , as it stands , this is one of jean-claude van damme's better motion pictures . considering how abysmal some of the entries on his resume have been , that's not saying much , but everyone has to start somewhere . van damme isn't much of an actor , but he has advanced beyond the stagnant stage in which steven seagal is mired . at least for the moment , he's arnold schwarzenegger ( unamerican accent and all ) without the price tag . any film whose premise relies as heavily as timecop's does on time travel is inherently treading on dangerous ground . paradoxes abound in films like this , and how a script deals with them often determines the success of the movie . timecop doesn't attempt to ignore these problems--in fact , it makes one of them a key ingredient in the resolution--but the explanations are less-than-thorough and the logic is porous . the plot is actually a little more substantial than that of most van damme movies . the film's scientific and technological views may be on the shaky side , but at least it doesn't commit the cardinal sin of attempting to explain time travel . such technobabble-laced expositions typically sound ludicrous . as far as the action sequences are concerned , there are plenty of them , all of which are competently-executed ( even if every one of them seems to happen in the midst of a downpour ) . the tension never comes close to the level of a speed , but timecop is unlikely to put anyone to sleep . sadly , a lackluster music score by mark isham does little to elevate the adrenaline level . while this villain isn't close to the standards of die hard's hans grueber , he's still pretty easy to dislike . bruce mcgill turns in a solid supporting performance as the head of the tec police force . timecop is in the total recall category of storytelling : take a popular action film star , throw him into a science fiction setting , add a few minor plot twists , and let him blast and punch his way out of trouble . as far as this formula is concerned , timecop lacks much of total recall's wit and cleverness . concerning the time travel issues , don't think too deeply , otherwise you're likely to realize just how poorly-considered the script's treatment of them is . time paradoxes are supposed to be mind-boggling ; timecop has reduced them to a level somewhere between confusing and dumb . 
2	in this film , about a child-murderer , his first talkie , it was made with surprisingly the highest sound quality , which is quite an achievement if you keep in mind how this was his first experience with that new medium . new york , 1947 , lang stated why he has such an avid interest in murder : " gradually , and at times reluctantly , i have come to the conclusion that every human mind harbors a latent compulsion to murder . " you can chalk " m " up as a lasting masterpiece , created with a passion for detail and a successful transitional film from the silents to the talkies , taking into its mise en scene the best of both those worlds . at its best , " m " emulates the accomplishments found in all the great works of poetry . it is still the greatest of all the serial killer films made , even if it is mistakeningly considered by some , now , as merely a museum piece . all you have to do is compare the depth of its storytelling with the greatest films of that genre , a genre that lang's film spawned , such as psycho and the silence of the lambs . and , when you compare it to a slick thriller , like the recent american psycho , it is not difficult to see how shallow that one is in comparison . this tune will become the ominous leitmotif throughout the film . since lorre couldn't whistle , it was lang's whistling that was used . it is evident that lang saw here the festering wounds nazism would later on fully exploit to its own advantages , in a society that was already decadent and had lost its sense of responsibility . what gives this film its power , is how the entire city is analyzed by how they react to the crime . the film is expeditious in its stark treatment of the innocuous lorre , who does not stand out from the crowd and is physically a small and fragile man . he finally screams out , getting the pity of a few , " i have no control over my urges . i want to escape from myself , but it is impossible . " 
1	after his great success writing , directing , and starring in the low budget flick the brothers mcmullen , edward burns is back . this time he has a hollywood bankrolled film , but he keeps his comedic sights set on his favorite subjects : catholic male angst , infidelity , and most of all , sex - particularly the lack thereof . given that most of the cast leads return , you can excuse the audience if they think the film is the brothers mcmullen part 2 . actually , this time the story is different and the brothers have changed their last name to fitzpatrick . the one-liners are both the strength and the weakness of the film . some work , and some don't . the ones that do are terrific and the main reason to see the picture . unfortunately , one-liners do not a relationship make . the characters are all interesting individually , and yet none are compelling or involving . with life reduced to one-liners , they have no way to develop a chemistry with each other or with the audience . you're never going to make any real money . " francis thinks this is stupid , and chides him with , " romance is great , but i just want to remind you , it don't pay the bills . " you don't even believe in god . " all in all , the show is an enjoyable but shallow little comedy signifying nothing . the one-liners frequently work , and actors are good , but trapped in their material . my favorite is cameron diaz , who has extremely captivating eyes . based on her work in the last supper , she is probably the most talented of the lot . mahoney is a fine , but colorless supporting actor . the others have promise , but the jury is out . here they did an excellent job of reading their jokes and entertaining me , but none of them were convincing . it is rated r solely because they use the f word a few times . this is much tamer show than this year's pg-13 rated the nutty professor which was non-stop foul language , but used every cuss word except the f word . in she's the one , there is no violence , no nudity although there are a lot of missing bras , and no sex although they do talk about it incessantly . it would be fine for any teenager . i give the show a mild thumbs up as it was funny in parts and entertaining , and award it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : august 31 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	cast : treat williams , famke janssen , wes studi , kevin j . o'connor , anthony heald director : stephen sommers producers : john baldecchi , laurence mark screenplay : stephen sommers cinematography : howard atherton music : jerry goldsmith u . s . distributor : hollywood pictures here's something to chew on : what's the favorite food of big , cheesy-looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising ? the obvious answer to this question is cardboard , because that's the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature . deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer . in fact , considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas , perhaps it was . the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore . not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non-human ) been scattered in all directions . i suppose deep rising's gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre , but it doesn't do much for me . on the surface , and that's about the only level at which this film can be analyzed , deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic ( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens/titanic connection , since james cameron directed both ) . in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue-in-cheek mayhem of tremors , deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin . the film is not humorous , tense , or exciting . in fact , it's downright boring , and , despite being half the length of cameron's current box-office champ , deep rising feels like the longer movie . is it really necessary to say anything about the plot ? probably not , since it's easy to guess , but i'll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis . in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics , there's finnegan ( treat williams ) , the boat's pilot , who's supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff ; joey ( kevin j . o'connor ) , the inept sidekick who's supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the " mastermind " ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation . the reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles . williams , once a " can't miss " prospect in hollywood , has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising , and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career . given her limited acting abilities , it's likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes . meanwhile , kevin j . o'connor , who has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard . these days , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer-generated special effects . the days of jurassic park , when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen , are past . now , movie-goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic -- visuals that are so well-incorporated that it's impossible to tell where they end and where " reality " begins . in deep rising , the monster , like everything , is artificial and unconvincing . unfortunately , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn't so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture , but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre ( although , to be fair , deep rising is a particularly bad entry ) . even once this film has sunk out of sight , the knowledgeable viewer knows it won't be the last of its kind . like the slimy , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies , more are waiting just around the corner in ambush . and that consideration , unlike anything on screen , is truly horrifying . - ingmar bergman 
2	it sets a high standard for submarine films , as a well-crafted , serious work , that created a lot of nail-biting tension and evoked a suspenseful atmosphere , and might very well be the best submarine film ever made . wolfgang petersen was nominated but did not win an oscar for his directing . it also gave the director a chance to come to hollywood to show off his ability to shoot action films , where he made " in the line of fire " / " air force one " / " perfect storm . " das boot was one of the most popular foreign films in america at the time , and is still doing very well in its video rentals . the ships were escorted by destroyers and were sometimes protected by airplanes . that was an amazing scene . i couldn't imagine a hollywood film showing americans not rescuing drowning seamen , even if their submarine had no room for the prisoners . what this excellently told story fails to do , is come to terms with the political situation or the moral implications of the war . it is seen best as a film that is technically superb , drawing out the reality of what it is like to be on the submarine and showing how terrible it is to go to war . the boat constructed by rolf zehetbauer and g ? tz weidner , which duplicates the cramped boat down to its grimy details , and provides the film with the proper setting for its intense realism . the superb use of sound , helped elevate this film above all other submarine films , as every sound in the quiet of the submarine is heard : the splashing against a destroyer's propellers , the eerie ping sounds , the bellowing roar of a depth charge , and the creaks of a hull . jurgen prochnow's sterling performance gave the film the quiet hero it needed to anchor its story , as his will to fight , his intelligent leadership , and his quiet determinism to fight a glorious war , were nobly shown , as the men under him completely respected him . the crew was made up of sympathetic figures and not cardboard nazis most ww11 films seen from an american perspective portray onscreen for the germans . what the film seemed to be aiming at , was not a big statement against war , but how the captain was a professional and treated his men accordingly , expecting them to do their best no matter what . the film succeeds in humanizing the men in this mostly true story , as it highlights the crew when it is singing their favorite song , " it's a long way to tipperary , " and that's the most vocal this very quiet , very emotionally gripping , and very entertaining film will get about anything . 
1	like last year's atrocious rookie of the year , little big league is a boy's fantasy . the unfortunate thing is that too often this sort of fantasy doesn't make a good drama--passable entertainment , perhaps , but there isn't enough meat for anything more solid personally , i prefer baseball movies flavored by nostalgia . using real , current major league teams is problematic because it forces a fanciful film into the realm of reality--not a good place to be for something like little big league . at least in this case , unlike in major league 2 , today's players aren't snubbed . the premise is relatively simple . the most serious failing of little big league is the screenplay . >from beginning to end , the movie feels painfully scripted . there is no sense of spontaneity , and none of the actors gives a strong enough performance to transcend this limitation . the first half of the motion picture is especially poor , as characters and situations are introduced in contrived fashion . the antiseptic clubhouse atmosphere is not representative of that of a real baseball team . sure , there are the petty jealousies and ego trips , but none are presented in a convincing fashion . without exception , the players are ciphers with cardboard personalities . the lack of salty language is as obvious as the lack of enthusiasm , and there's far too much culture and civility . the interesting thread that flows through the film deals with how the pressure to win can quell the simple fun and enjoyment of playing the game . billy starts out saying that all he wants is for everyone to enjoy themselves--don't worry about errors or wins ; just give a good effort . the smile and youthful enthusiasm are gone . unfortunately , the resolution of this situation is simplistic and disappointing . like so much else in this motion picture , it feels phony--just another easy way out of a tough situation . life , even on the baseball diamond , isn't like that , and for a movie with a lesson to teach , this sort of facile solution rings false . the enjoyable portions of little big league can't camouflage the limited quality of the production . the humor is low-key and occasionally effective . there is a running gag concerning the proliferation of statistics in the game . unfortunately , there are too few of these moments . this is something that little big league wants to ignore , to the detriment of its credibility . this film never believably captures the sport it portrays , and that leads to a picture that's closer to a strikeout than a home run . 
2	" i think about them first . " in the comedy lansdown , a very promising first effort by writer/director tom zuber and his first-time cast and crew , hector doesn't think long enough . it turns out that not just any roofer will do . the script , which has shades of tarantino , is quite funny . there is an undertone of seriousness as well , and the story would have been improved if they have developed that more . the sharply written scene speaks volumes about the inability of men and women to communicate . it is not rated but would be an r for violence and language . the film would be acceptable for older teenagers . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
1	screenplay : marc lawrence , based on the original screenplay by neil simon . producers : robert evans , robert w . cort , david madden and teri schwartz . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations , drug use ) running time : 88 minutes . the out-of-towners is the sort of film i generally greet with a generous helping of pooh-poohing . it's a remake ( of a neil simon-penned 1970 original which i have never seen ) , it's a vehicle to re-unite two stars of a previous film ( steve martin and goldie hawn , from 1992's housesitter ) , and it's a broad farce cloaked in shallow sentimentality . the out-of-towners often feels like it's working awfully hard to extract its guffaws , yet it still manages to extract its fair share . the comic energy of the three lead performers -- including the incomparable john cleese -- makes this silly trifle something moderately satisfying . it shouldn't be a surprise that the out-of-towners feels derivative , and not just because it's a remake . nearly every element in the film is designed to have the comfort of the familiar , from the pairing of the two stars , to martin's fuming in a planes , trains & automobiles scenario , to hawn's earnest ditziness , to cleese's resurrection of basil fawlty and python-esque cross-dressing . while the script by marc lawrence ( writer of forces of nature , who appears unusually fond of thwarted travel plans as an aphrodisiac ) pauses occasionally so henry and nancy can muse about the nature of their marriage , it's mostly concerned with set-ups for slapstick situations and tirades . at times , those situations and tirades feel forced ; you can practically see hawn and martin screaming to the audience for whoops and applause when they go on their respective rants against someone who gets their goat . at plenty of others , the actors give the old-fashioned farce a kick it rarely gets on screen . even more wonderful is cleese , a comic treasure too rarely seen . he may be able to do smiling misanthropes like his character here in his sleep , but he still sends a charge through the out-of-towners every moment he's on screen . cleese's scenes are reason alone for comedy fans to spend an hour and a half with this film . i do wish the out-of-towners had shown more restraint with its characters , subjecting them to a bit more frustration and a bit less abject humiliation . it's not a subtle film by any stretch of the imagination , but there was enough humor to be found in the performers that we didn't need to see martin taking a hallucinogenic trip with his pants around his ankles . you may find a lot of the out-of-towners familiar and foolish ; you may also find yourself laughing at it in spite of yourself . there's something to be said for the way talented professionals can take predictable material and wring something fresh and funny from it . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
2	heard any good stories lately ? think any of them are true ? jon shear's edgy thriller , urbania , loves to mess with our minds , and it has lots of stories to tell us . set on a night with a built-in extra hour due to the daylight savings time shift , the episodic story has characters who relate incidents with varying degrees of believability . the reaction of the characters hearing the stories frequently reveals more about them than about the teller . sometimes nervous laughter will be followed by painful introspection . the disorienting film takes devious delight in layering various versions of the stories so that we feel like we're jurors looking into a courtroom lined with funhouse mirrors . what are we supposed to believe ? one thing certain in this intriguing and distorting tale is that our eyes are glued to the screen . the wonderfully labyrinthic script by daniel reitz and jon shear is based on reitz's play " urban folk tales . " one story , about a woman with a wet poodle and a microwave , is thrown in as the story's only real joke . the script is especially good at not telegraphing which stories have legs and which end almost before they begin . even the most minor of these incidents are staged with such creepy class that they become quite intriguing . it's the sort of film in which even innocuous phrases such as , " don't forget to set your clock back , " manage to have dark , ominous portents . the crisp editing by randolph bricker and ed marx keeps us on our toes as images sometimes flash by like a hit-and-run and others times linger to haunt us . and shane kelly's cinematography captures the mood almost too well . nightmares after this film are definitely possible , not so much for what happens as for the movie's raw intensity . " just give me a second to figure out the ending , " charlie tells us at the opening of the movie . the biggest disappointment for me was that urbania doesn't really have an ending . and for adventuresome moviegoers , urbania takes us through a fascinating night when danger is definitely in the air . urbania runs a little long at 1 : 43 . 
2	more later on why i say " somewhat . " it stars kathy bates as dolores claiborne in another one of bates brilliant acting performances . selena , likewise , is a walking time bomb of pent up anger about something . it was an interesting and effective editing technique . the two parallel stories work equally well , and thanks to the editing , they are interwoven nicely . the past has lots of abuse , violence , and major alcoholism . i was never quite sure the meaning of this while watching the show . a couple of days later it hit me why , and it made sense . if you see it and can not figure it out , i am not going to tell you the answer . you will have to keep pondering . actually , that you still think about a movie after you leave is a tribute to its effectiveness . the cinematography was certainly beautiful in the golden hues of sunset and in the glow of a solar eclipse . on the other hand , i felt it overpowered the story and would have been more appropriate in another movie . the scenes of dark and depressing grays were also overdone i thought . better to have the acting and the script convey the mood and have the cinematography complement it rather than overwhelm it . the acting was good around with one exception . he is too much of a nice guy , and it showed through . his evil was too one dimensional and was rarely threatening . a thriller needs a strong villain , and dolores claiborne had none . i attribute this problem solely to strathairn and to the directing ( taylor hackford ) and not to the script ( tony gilroy ) . having a weak villain relegated the movie to being somewhat of a thriller with a lightweight mystery attached . with a more effective bad guy , this movie could have really taken off . instead , it became more a character study , which was very effective , and a mood piece , which , as i already said , was overdone . dolores claiborne runs 2 : 11 , but it did not seem that long . it is correctly rated r for significant amounts of realistic domestic violence and for alcohol and drug abuse . i think it would be fine for mature teenagers . i recommend this movie to you , and i award it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	an entertaining mystery filmed from the back lot of mgm , though it convincingly looks like foggy london . the only thing that is found inside is a note in red chalk saying : pay or be seen no more ! it was strictly lightweight fare , done in a breezy style , but it proved to be an enjoyable b-film . 
2	running time : 179 minutes . at one pivotal point in magnolia -- one of several pivotal points in paul thomas anderson's epic of human connection and disconnection -- a woman sits alone in her apartment , singing along to a song . he does this half a dozen more times , capturing every one of his principal characters accompanying the haunting original aimee mann composition " wise up . " that sequence in magnolia is one of the year's best pieces of film-making , and i could name a dozen more moments from the film that will be sticking in my memory . if anderson had pulled all those pieces of film-making together into a stronger whole , magnolia might have been the year's best film , instead of just a very good one . it's certainly an ambitious work , following many characters through one rainy day in the san fernando valley . in a way , the whole thing is little more than an extended attempt to justify the film's most surreal device ( more on which later ) . it's also undeniably compelling , charged by anderson's kitchen sink visual style . and for three hours , that's what magnolia does : it delivers thrilling scene after thrilling scene which , by all rights , should simply feel self-indulgent . when anderson nails these characters at their most vulnerable and conflicted , he creates sensational scenes for actors . magnolia plays like a cross between a symphony and a jazz jam , with solo showcases building toward splendidly edited crescendos . the only thing missing is an anchor , something that ties anderson's multiple story lines together in a way that makes them greater than the sum of their parts . and yes , sins of the fathers play a role in most of the characters' lives . it's obvious anderson wants us to feel a connection . i just don't think he pulls it off , giving more attention to the individual trespasses and recriminations than to the links between them . there's sure to be much talk about anderson's most audacious attempt to pull his story together , a cloudburst in which something besides rain falls from the sky in a torrent . i'm not about to guess what anderson was thinking by loosing a biblical plague upon the san fernando valley , nor will i pretend the credulity-stretching trick doesn't feel more like a grand gag than a dramatic fulcrum . there's also something about it that just plain works -- maybe just as damn-the-torpedoes film-making , maybe as acknowledgement of how primal forces can throttle you into re-evaluating your life . that , in a nutshell , is the wonderful frustration of magnolia . part of you wants to expose anderson as a philosophical poseur , and the other half can't stop watching everything he throws at the screen . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
0	just like the formula script of free willy 3 : the rescue , she does not think ahead . john mattson , the writer of free willy 2 : the adventure home , again connects the dots to give us basically the same movie plus one . randolph , played by august schellenberg , is again the most animated of the characters . among the best and worst parts of the plot are the villains . in easily the most refreshing part of the picture , the film explores briefly the other side of an environmental issue . the problem with this approach is that it becomes hard to hate a bad guy who seems trapped in his profession and who is such a good father . without an adequate villain , the show lacks much credible tension . tv director sam pillsbury's film feels like a direct-to-video production , which is how the inevitable free willy 4 should be marketed . as a two dollar rental that only the kids watch , the movie becomes a more palatable proposition . within the confines of a theater , pillsbury's lethargic pacing and the script's paucity of ideas become all too apparent . the dialog is full of the platitudes one might find in a substandard third grade reader . " they don't feel . the only reason to see the show are the frolicking whale sequences , framed nicely by the rugged mountains of the pacific northwest coast . the most remarkable scenes are those shot underwater , featuring close-ups of the people and the whales looking eye-to-eye . still , a half hour short film of just these scenes would have been much preferable to a feature length movie padded with the recycled material from the last two movies in the series . if your kids want to see this film , try to talk up the advantages of waiting for it to come out on video . maybe by then they will have forgotten , and you can suggest some much better show at the video rental store instead . the scene where willy gets shot with a spear may be too much for kids under 6 , but for older ones the show would be fine . my son jeffrey , age 8 , thought the film was great but complained that all the free willy pictures have the same story . my sentiments exactly . i give thumbs down to this lame rehash and award it * 1/2 for at least having the courage to try to tell two sides of an environmental issue . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	sure , it's easy to take cynical swipes at family entertainment , especially formulaic family entertainment like free willy 3 . and perhaps it deserves better . all that , and not once does anyone get kicked in the groin or break wind . but family audiences deserve better , too . they shouldn't have to settle for merely competent film-making like free willy 3 simply because it's less noxious than the alternatives . every one of the things free willy 3 has going for it is something the delightful shiloh also managed to do -- and do better -- without making the villain so predictable he refers to whales as " fish , " or padding the running time with several minutes of second unit nature footage . there is nothing actively insulting , offensive or annoying about free willy 3 . there is nothing actively entertaining or enriching about it , either , unless it is to learn the sheer tonnage of blood which accompanies the birth of a baby orca . certain self-appointed guardians of cinematic morality have pronounced that american parents are clamoring for worthy films to show their children . i'm still waiting for the din to reach my ears . i certainly didn't hear anyone clamoring for yet another free willy film , especially after the over-plotted and half-baked free willy 2 . it's too easy for parents to settle , too easy for producers to give parents as much as they will tolerate and nothing more . welcome home . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
0	screenplay : david zucker , pat proft and robert locash . i'd like to say a word at this time about the proliferation of genre parody/spoofs in the last year : stop . in twelve months we've seen at least half a dozen such films ( loaded weapon 1 , fatal instinct , robin hood : men in tights , etc . ) , with roughly that many laughs between them . last year's hot shots ! part deux was a tolerable but limp effort ; still , it shines next to naked gun 33-1/3 . the third installment in the series is only sporadically amusing , and often crosses the pop culture cannibalism scale from parody into self-parody . the first ten minutes of naked gun 33-1/3 offers some promise . the opening sequence targets the train station steps sequence from the untouchables , and it features some solid belly laughs thanks to a careful setup . there are also a couple of winning moments in the traditional opening credits featuring a roof's-eye view from a moving police car , particularly a nod to the death star trench run from star wars . unfortunately , that's where naked gun 33-1/3 hits the runout groove . in a zaz film , whether or not it works ultimately comes down to how many of the gags work , and there are painfully few good gags here . part of the problem can be attributed to director peter segal . much of the enjoyment from earlier zaz efforts came from watching the backgrounds , picking up jokes on the fringes of the frame . you fill in the gag ) . while none of their films were afraid to go for groaners , the difference is that they didn't underline them . many of the films naked gun 33-1/3 chooses to parody seem ripe for the picking , but the execution stumbles . jane's departure with friend louise in a green oldsmobile convertible seems to offer a great deal of promise , but the expected thelma & lousie parody offers surprising little payoff . time after time it looks like something worthwhile is coming along , and time after time the jokes just fall flat . there is one other crucial factor worth noting in naked gun 33-1/3 , and that is the performance of leslie nielsen . similarly , fred ward brings none of the qualities ricardo montalban and robert goulet brought to the first two films . rather than playing against the laughs , all the performers seem to be playing with them , and much of the goofiness is lost . it's too bad . i was hoping we could avoid naked gun . 44 : magnum farce . 
2	producers : martha delaurentiis and dino delaurentiis . director : jonathan mostow . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 95 minutes . even critics can fall into the same trap of equating the idea with the complete film . when a film with a familiar premise appears , you're likely to see dismissive reviews which perpetuate the notion that the real culprit is lack of originality , rather than lack of craft . of course , by those standards william shakespeare would be the most reviled plagiarist of all time -- how dare he steal his plots from antiquity , from english history , from other writers ? . a great idea works , but it can work more than once . it's the mark of a talented artist when he can take that recognizable idea and make it something original and exciting . take breakdown , for instance . the malevolent trucker and desert landscapes owe a debt to steven spielberg's duel , and there is a recognizably hitchockian quality to russell's ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances . all of this might have left me shaking my head , if breakdown hadn't been so good at leaving me shaking all over . breakdown is as viscerally effective as any thriller hollywood has turned out in the last few years , because mostow understands what works . the hero is a slightly paunchy everyman , smart and resourceful enough for us to believe he has a chance at survival , and kurt russell does a nice job keeping the anger and determination from becoming one-note . the situation is just plausible and unnerving enough to get under your skin , with a creeping sense of paranoia which could affect the audience as much as it affects jeff . walsh in particular has the chilling ability to make a word into a weapon , and to make a stare as brutal as any of the pistol-whippings which permeate breakdown . over and above all that , mostow demonstrates a keen sense for how to construct a gripping , efficient thriller . the opening half hour is a subtle rumble of mounting dread , which in turn becomes a roller-coaster series of set pieces , which in turn becomes an all-stops-pulled finale , all in the course of 95 minutes . breakdown is most definitely intended as a crowd-pleaser , peppered as it is with frequent opportunities for the audience to cheer jeff turning the tables on his tormenters . it is also a remarkably effective crowd-pleaser , one which doesn't throw common sense or continuity to the wind for the sake of a punch line . by the time breakdown builds to a climactic four-car chase -- a somewhat excessive conclusion to an otherwise lean thriller -- mostow has demonstrated a rare talent for grabbing an audience and refusing to let go . there is another stolen idea in breakdown which isn't entirely mostow's doing . advertising for the film ominously warns " it could happen to you , " a nod to thrillers which became pop culture phenomena by appealing to our collective 20th-century conviction that every stranger is a serial killer waiting to happen -- call this one the " good samaritan truck driver from hell . " mostow actually goes a bit farther , playing the conflict in breakdown as class warfare , and it is disappointing to watch such a solid film resort to back-brain prejudices . if you think about breakdown long enough , you'll probably discover some things which bother you -- why , for instance , jeff didn't seem at all concerned about his wife riding with a stranger , or why the villains seem to thwart their own plan at the outset . you may even think about the fact that you've seen something like breakdown before . and it may not matter , because the idea is only the frame for a vehicle . jonathan mostow has given this one an engine with a heck of a kick . 
2	cast : grazyna szapolowska , olaf lubaszenko , stefina iwinska director : krzysztof kieslowski producer : ryszard chutkowski screenplay : krzysztof kieslowski and krzysztof piesiewicz cinematography : witold adamek music : zbigniew preisner in polish with subtitles hypnotically engrossing , this picture delves deep into the psyches of its two main characters , employing irony , humor , and drama to weave a masterful tale of human interaction that will leave an indelible imprint on all who view it . a question that people have pondered for ages is whether there exists a pure form of romantic love -- an attraction so deep and innocent that sex becomes an unwanted distraction . for eighty-six minutes in a short film about love , kieslowski explores this issue . nothing is resolved , except perhaps an understanding of the great pain and fragility that can result from the simple act of opening one's heart . as his obsession deepens , tomek is no longer content with merely watching . certainly , the central irony in the film is how the tables are turned . obliquely , the closing scene of a short film about love indicates she might find it . in this , the resolution is vastly different than that of decalogue 6 , which concluded with an emotionless tomek admitting to magda that he will never spy on her again . coupled with several added scenes that build character and fill plot holes , this different ending gives a new and more satisfying outlook to the story than the one presented in decalogue . >from that moment on , the story is told from magda's viewpoint . this unique way of framing things allows for greater development and understanding of both characters . there are a lot of very funny moments in a short film about love . however , even beyond the comic undercurrent , there are many comparisons between this movie and the middle entry in the three colors trilogy . love is probably the most commonly presented theme in all motion pictures . most of the time , it is used as a plot device , so rarely is there a thoughtful examination of the dynamics of the emotion . a short film about love is the exception , and what a magnificent exception it is . with actors that give finely-tuned performances and a script that is richly detailed , the movie is nothing short of a masterpiece . there is more real feeling in this brief feature than in a hundred full-length hollywood romantic comedies . 
0	screenplay : ruth prawer jhabvala . director : james ivory . if ismail merchant and james ivory are not careful , their names might very well lose their proper noun status . like q-tip or xerox , " merchant ivory " is becoming something of a generic term , a descriptor for intimate period pieces in the tradition of critical successes like a room with a view , howards end and the remains of the day . for many moviegoers , though , the term is also used to evoke images of technically proficient but turgid filmmaking . sadly , jefferson in paris is everything their most vocal detractors have accused merchant ivory efforts of being . there are plenty of beautiful sets , meaningful glances and profound discussions , but there isn't a shred of compelling drama to connect them , or a single key character into whose life we are given any insight . this is not a biographical sketch with a point of view . it's a series of anecdotes , many of them apocryphal . or a lengthy scene at an opera in which the relationship between jefferson and maria cosway is not furthered one bit ? writer ruth prawer jhabvala is a genius at adapting the narratives of other writers for the screen , but she does a terrible job of constructing a narrative from a collection of historical footnotes . this is simply everything you always wanted to know about thomas jefferson but were afraid to ask . it is an awful performance of a character with tremendous potential , and the script never even bothers to try to get inside his head . i felt i had a better understanding of jefferson from staring at mount rushmore . ivory does deliver some finely crafted scenes , of course , such as louis xvi learning about the revolution while on a hunt , and richard robbins' score and tony pierce-roberts' cinematography are characteristically superb . it isn't about the scandalous , if historically questionable , notion that jefferson fathered children by one of his slaves . it isn't really * about * anything . like the worst high school history textbooks , it just starts in one place and ends in another , and all you really want to do is look at the pictures . 
0	it's good in parts , but it fails to deliver in its unbelievable surprise ending . 
2	although i have not been a jarmusch fan before this picture , i am now . dead man features a great performance by the ever enthralling johnny depp ( ed wood , don juan demarco and edward scissorhands ) , impressive and moving black and white cinematography by robby mueller ( to live and die in la and repo man ) , and a score by neil young so strong that it dominates , but never overpowers the picture . although the show is quirky enough not to be everyone's cup of tea , i was blown away by it . the fireman prophetically advises him , " i wouldn't trust no words written on no piece of paper . " the coal dust make-up ( neal martz ) on the fireman gives him a realistic but macabre appearance . the acting in the show is sharp and taut . there are two outstanding performances by depp and farmer . depp can convey more through just expressions than most loquacious actors can with volumes of words . in a film whose strength lies in its bold imagery , the casting of depp as the lead is brilliant . farmer plays an assertive , fresh mouthed indian with a natural gift for humor . i loved farmer just as much as depp in the picture . the script by jim jarmusch is smart and biting . the director's pacing and the relaxed and smooth editing by jay rabinowitz make for a dreamy show . most scenes have dramatic neil young electric guitar music , cinematography with sharp black and whites , but with highly gradational grays , and long blank places between words . this is a director who knows the value of a character's silence and how to use it to maximum effect . i do not remember a movie where the music worked better or where it was more central to the success of the film . i am not a neil young fan either , but i was mesmerized by his work here . as the show was drawing to a close , i began to wonder how they would end it . to me the ending is perfect , and it provides a beautiful symmetry to the beginning . when the show was over and the house lights went up , i felt privileged to have seen a incredible piece of cinematic art . totally unique . it is rated r for some sex , brief nudity , and some very violent scenes like the one where they slice someone's skin and blood spurts out . i think it would be fine for any mature teenager . for some movies like anne frank remembered and the joy luck club , a critic can recommend it knowing that almost everyone will love it , where in other films like dead man , it is not so clear . nevertheless i recommend this show to you strongly if you are the last bit adventuresome in your cinematic tastes , and i award it * * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : may 4 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	screenplay : silvio horta . mpaa rating : r ( violence , sexual situations , profanity ) running time : 100 minutes . hey , did you ever hear the one about the really good post-scream teen horror film ? it seems that some film-makers , realizing there was a new market to be tapped after the success of scream and its sequel , decided to make an even better variation on the theme . the script was intelligent , the obligatory pop culture asides felt more than obligatory , and the suspense was genuinely scary . it was both fresh _and_ frightening . no , really , it actually happened . a friend of my cousin's sister-in-law actually saw it . sorry , friends , but the preceding is a myth -- an urban legend if you will , exactly the kind which forms the basis of the film of the same name . if you actually care about the answer to that question by the end of urban legend , it will only be to see how convoluted the explanation could be . like too many recent horror films , this one obliges you to play name that killer , without giving you enough information to permit anything but a random guess . and if you think abut the revelation for long enough afterwards , you'll realize it just doesn't matter . stop wasting our time ; this is a slasher film , not agatha christie . frankly , it's about time slasher films started acting like slasher films in plenty of ways . ever since scream ( or even wes craven's earlier new nightmare , if you wanna be picky ) , horror films have gone all post-modern on us , eschewing grind-it-out gore in favor of winking recognition of genre conventions . urban legend's pop culture nuggets range from the acceptably smirky ( a snippet of the " dawson's creek " theme played when " dawson's creek " cast member jackson turns on his car radio ) to the who-cares ridiculous ( naming one character after one of the film's producers ) , and those are only a couple of examples of the strained reaches for gags in silvio horta's script . there's just not enough humor or creativity to compensate for the raw terror lost in forced attempts to be cute . aside from the effective prologue sequence , urban legend misses the boat on providing gut-level scares . ironically enough , it also misses the point that most of the late 70s/early 80s slasher films these arched-eyebrow cousins goof on were actually moralizing cautionary tales , just like the ones described by englund's folklore professor . urban legend nicks from the cine-literate horror of scream without even realizing it , because movies _are_ our urban legends . pity the talented alicia witt ( late of tv's " cybill " ) for getting caught up in a horror film that's not clever enough or scary enough to succeed as anything but a clutch-your-date friday night special . urban legend is a tale too often told . and as one character in the film says , " if you're going to tell the story , at least get it right .

1	bullets over broadway is woody allen's latest movie . it is one of his pure comedies with no attempt at any seriousness . it is not as slapstick or silly as say bananas or take the money and run . it is more in the vein of the purple rose of cairo or broadway danny rose . my thumb ended in the up position mainly on the strength of palminteri's performance . the sound effects editing and , to a lessor extent , the dialog made bullets over broadway feel more like a play than a movie . this can be heard most of all in the indoor scenes . the speech dominates everything , is frequently spoken extra loud without shouting , and there is a minimum of ambient noise in the background . the acting is good , but other than palminteri , nothing special . the dialog is bright and funny but not allen's best . the street scenes of new york are extremely well done . bullets over broadway runs only 1 : 38 but still seemed like it needed a bit more editing . it is rated r but should have been pg-13 . it has some profanity , a little violence , and no sex or nudity . it would be fine for teenagers to see by themselves . i give it a mild thumbs up - i had hoped for more , but it is funny . i award it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	nicolas roeg's mesmerizing 1971 film walkabout exists on a different and higher plane than traditional films . until very recently this classic film was not available on tape and the theatrical version available in america did not have the nude scenes which are essential to the show's almost spiritual essence as they illustrate the girl's becoming one with nature . we were privileged to see the full length version recently at a local repertory theater , but the video version , released by home vision cinema , is also the complete australian original . although director and cinematographer roeg approaches the material as if it were a dream , the actions have a poetic truth as well as a lyrical beauty . some may find parts of the story confusing , but all of them make sense if you think about them long enough . unlike today's typically transparent films , walkabout expects that the viewers will be so engrossed by the story that they will be willing to invest the energy to think through what is happening . we certainly were . the best performance is by jenny agutter . she oozes a natural charm and sexuality without ever being flirtatious . at that age where she has the body of a woman but the limitations of someone still a schoolgirl , she displays remarkable resilience and maturity . her acting leaves an impression on you long after you leave the theater . why she has only gotten small parts in dozens of minor films since remains a mystery . the unusual camera angles and antony gibbs' and alan patillo's editing immediately put the audience on notice that this is no ordinary film . sometimes shots are frozen so that the images left have the blur of motion . one of the many themes of the picture is the duality of human life as part of both the civilized world and the animal kingdom . this is illustrated in many ways but most frequently by dwelling on animals eating other animals , in nature as well as in the city . cuts between a butcher chopping meat and an animal devouring its kill are typical . " it's silly to give in now . it can't be much further . " of course , it is . " that's as simple as i can make it . anybody can understand that . " along the way , the sexual tension between the two teenagers builds until you are sure it will explode , but it doesn't . the result is a beautifully erotic movie where not even a kiss is exchanged . one could easily write a long essay on this richly textured movie , but words cannot fully express what is mainly a visual experience . the script by edward bond , based on the novel by john vance marshall , uses images for dialog . words are rarely spoken except for the brother who sometimes starts babbling , but these words are more background noise . the interest in the show is the focus on the girl and the aborigine . the chemistry between them is strong , and their few words are more than sufficient . to complement the sparseness of the spoken word , the music by four time academy award winner john barry has a majesty reflective of the film's beautiful landscapes and charming wildlife . the movie even includes my favorite australian animal , the cute little wombat . after a surprising but effective ending , the show wraps up with a sentimental epilogue . like the rest of the show , both are quite confusing until you think about them some . in the day since i've seen the film , i cannot put it out of my mind . its images continue to be savored , and i will never forget the three travelers through the desert . it is not rated but would be an r . the film would be excellent for teenagers . i strongly recommend this fascinating piece of filmmaking to you and give it my top rating of a full * * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : june 15 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	it is a pretentious arty film set in 1929 , which failed to be credible or involving . the story was emotionally flat and the contrived ending was ludicrous ( this was not the same ending in the novel ) . dalloway ) tried to say in this merchant-ivory styled literary film . it was a drawn out glossy affair stuffed with empty gestures to the arts , and i could never figure out what john turturro was trying to do with his role as the chess genius , who is both a social misfit and someone who is mentally unstable , except to ham it up by acting over-the-edge . there just never seemed to be any point or excitement to this film , as adapted by screenwriter peter berry from vladimir nabokov's ironic novel . this film is devoid of nabkov's wit and irony , it reminded me only of a film that was concerned with showing a pretty face , some pretty scenery to look at , and eschewing any controversy . the film was devoid of any fascist's presence , even though mussolini had come to power in the early part of the 1920s , so even the period film's background history is distorted . these flashbacks were an attempt at making crass amateur psychological explanations for luzhin's emotional unstability due to his wretched upbringing . these scenes are conventional and added little meaning to luzhin's personal dilemma . everything about luzhin seems heavy-handed and done only for effect and not to develop his character . whatever happens to him seemed overwrought and artificial . his over-acting and the way the film tried to make this unfeeling love affair into a real one , had a disingenous feel to it . this film felt heavy at all times , like it was load of manure being dumped on a story that deserved a better fate than this film was able to give it . 
0	screenplay : max d . adams and dick clement & ian la frenais . director : marco brambilla . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 100 minutes . it casts her in a role which seems perfectly suited to continuing that drawing power -- she's a motherless rich girl looking for a little affection , a la clueless -- and gives her plenty of opportunities to flash that crooked baby doll smile . make no mistake , excess baggage is the alicia silverstone show . so why does it feel like she is the one thing most dreadfully wrong with excess baggage ? perhaps because excess baggage , which appears on the surface to be an ideal comic caper vehicle for silverstone's daffy charms , is really an oddball black comedy struggling to break free . that is exactly what director marco brambilla tries to deliver , with miserable results . the first half of excess baggage moves with all the frisky energy of a constipated brontosaurus , offerring little more than monotonous bickering between the two leads . there's never a moment of chemistry between silverstone and del toro , no magnetism -- in fact , all known natural processes come to a dead stop when they are on screen together . they might as well be performing in two different films . at least one of those films might have been worth watching . benicio del toro is , to put it mildly , an unconventional screen presence , but he's never a boring one . his every reaction in excess baggage is worth a giggle of disbelief ; the more ridiculous and over-heated the plot gets , the more interesting del toro becomes . even while the story in excess baggage wanders from the mundane to the predictable , actors like del toro , christopher walken and nicholas turturro provide line readings with a bracing dose of surreality . " surreal " might as well be something you have at breakfast with milk as far as silverstone's performance is concerned . when it comes to playing material with an edge , she seems . . . well , it's much too late for her to recover her adorableness by the time the romance turns more conventional , complete with dialogue ( " do you like my tummy ? " ) which should come with a warning label if you're going to listen to it with a mouthful of popcorn . i can't imagine what silverstone's young fans will make of this strange film in which their idol is annoying and unlikeable , then hooks up with such a weirdo . if silverstone the newly-crowned mogul wanted to make a romantic comedy , she shouldn't have cast benicio del toro . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
2	and to avoid any questions about his guilt , we see charles in action in the opening scene with his last victim . john gay's script uses most of the original screenplay by sally benson , alma reville , and thornton wilder . karen arthur's direction is certainly no match for the great master , but on an absolute scale , the movie maintains a high level of suspense . two mysterious and exceedingly clean-cut writers for a magazine show up to take pictures of the family for a spread on the " average american family , " but their interest is focused on uncle charles , especially on taking his picture and learning about his background . harmon is wonderfully creepy and smug , and welsh is tough but trapped . with a deft touch the director sets up each scene , several with thunderstorms , and tom neuwirth's sepia-toned cinematography makes the movie feel as if it were filmed in the 50s . my only quibble is the director's awkward staging of the final scene on the train . is hitchcock's version better ? is this one worth watching as well ? actually , yes . it is not rated but would be pg for adult themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up . 
1	a solid psychological suspense yarn that plays like a modern noir , but one that comes to a screeching dead-end after its subject matter becomes exhausted and it decides to solve its moral dilemma with bullets instead of with the mind . it's a smart film with weighty dialogue to bring the story to the height of its dilemma in such a crisp way . what keeps the film compelling is the shaded introspective performance by macy who ably anchors the film , as he allows us to see who and what he is ; and , more importantly what suffering he is now going through . sutherland's performance is devilishly demonic , and in his understated call for violence gives voice to a very scary character who gets under our skin . bain's complicity with sutherland adds to the psychological trauma of the macy character . in contrast to the men , neve campbell's performance is loud and reaching . as a character-driven film , it is handled with a quiet reassurance by first-time director but experienced screenwriter henry bromell . panic plays like an episode for homicide does that has become more invigorated with psychological possibilities . bromell , the homicide cop-show writer , has made a tv cop drama come to life as a b movie that can't get away from tv's weakness of hanging a moral ending onto its dramatics . but , nevertheles , i still found it to be a hit man movie with a heart and a brain , a film that keeps a low profile while taking you on a mind trip laced with bitter irony . 
2	screenplay : richard linklater and kim krizan . director : richard linklater . there , now that i have dutifully trotted out all the terms that are * supposed * to apply to before sunrise , perhaps we can talk about what it really is . that is increasingly difficult to do with relationship-based films about characters in their 20s , which seem to come with generational baggage by the ton , and even harder to do when the director of the film in question is richard ( slacker ) linklater . but leave your pre-conceptions at the door , and you will be rewarded with a nearly perfect romance , a sweet , funny and poignant character study which , if there is any justice , will make julie delpy a star . before sunrise is likely to be a very polarizing kind of film , because it consists almost entirely of conversation between jesse and celine . there is a certain segment of the viewing public which will be driven to distracion by such a structure , and they should do themselves a favor and avoid it . i could argue with these individuals all day , and not convince them to see what i saw in before sunrise : two complex characters developing as genuine a relationship as you could hope to see on the screen . linklater and co-screenwriter kim krizan allow jesse and celine to unfold slowly , so that the characters we think we have figured out early in the film turn out to be something very different by the end . even in isolation , i found getting to know these characters fascinating . together , i found them even more remarkable . ethan hawke and julie delpy both deliver marvelous performances , developing an affection and connection which always seems absolutely real . while both are impressive , it is delpy who commands the camera's attention ; every reaction is on target , and every line seems spontaneous . in that one look , delpy says as much about what this film is about--the risk of romance--than all the dialogue . i keep returning to certain terms when thinking about and describing before sunrise--perfect , genuine , real . if that is so , it is because i have seen film after film over the past few years try to pass itself off as a romance without demonstrating the most cursory understanding about the way a real relationship develops . linklater does so many things right , but i would like to bring attention to things he * doesn't * do . he doesn't wait until the final reel for jesse and celine to kiss , accompanied by a full orchestra ; he doesn't manufacture pointless conflict ; and most astonishingly , he doesn't ever have them say " i love you . " before sunrise is about a single night which will become a perfect memory , and i am beginning to believe that is what the film will become for me . 
2	have you ever been so head over heels in love that you felt like you were floating ? in an age of ironic movie titles , it is refreshing to have one that is completely true . although gellar comes most recently from a teen movie background , simply irresistible is unabashedly adult , even its very mild pg-13 rating means that it would be fine for kids younger than teenagers . it's also a feel-good movie that isn't ashamed of emphasizing the upbeat and optimistic part of our souls . there isn't a dysfunctional family in sight , and the characters are the sort of nice people that you'd like to get to know better . the waitresses lug big pitchers of iced tea , and the plates don't match . " it's the whole point of the meal . " ) being on different ends of the economic scale , tom and amanda don't do much about their infatuation at first . the movie's most enchanting scene occurs in their next meeting after that first meal . the movie has a strong supporting cast that enriches the story . similar to like water for chocolate in its love of food and its association of eating with loving , simply irresistible is not a movie you should attempt to watch on an empty stomach lest you get such a ravishing hunger for great food that you are forced to leave the theater . and whatever you do , don't you dare let your spouse see it alone . the story puts such a romantic trance on the audience that your other half is liable to fall in love with the stranger in the next seat . simply irresistible runs a breezy 1 : 35 . it is rated pg-13 for brief sexual references and would be fine for any kid old enough to be interested in romance . 
0	even the name before the film has changed , with disney shuttling the sequel from its flagship banner to dimension , the genre division of miramax ( apparently realizing the original had too few fart jokes to qualify as a live-action disney film ) . i only wish that with all those changes they could have rustled up a new screenwriting team . naturally this leads to amusing sequences of buddy befuddling opposing defenses as he makes like jerry rice . but wait , there's more ! the original air bud had good intentions and solid family values to spare , but it tied them up in such derivative and unfocused package that even the kids in the audience couldn't keep their attention on the precocious pooch . new director richard martin picks up the pace considerably this time around , but he can't do much to create any cohesiveness with this story . from moment to moment , it's hard to tell whether air bud : golden receiver is supposed to be an afterschool special , a john hughes film or an episode of rocky and bullwinkle ( though with considerably less wit ) . it's also hard to take seriously a film where a premise so bizarre is shrugged off as a given . this time around , buddy trots onto the field in his leather helmet and shoulder pads as though it were the most natural thing in the world . perhaps somewhere on the cutting room floor is a scene in which an arbitrator cites the " air bud " precedent . without such a scene , everything that follows seems a little insulting to the intelligence , and an indication of how lazy the screenwriters were that they couldn't come up with some creative way to land buddy on the team . i'm not pretending that air bud : golden receiver was made with me in mind . this one is a short attention span kiddie-caper which did have the young ones clapping and guffawing with some regularity , and perhaps that counts for something . it even features a few decent throwaway gags , including a llama named dolly and a splendidly off-key rendition of the american national anthem . there's just something vaguely desperate about this whole air bud franchise -- they have build not just one film but a series of them on what amounts to a better-than-average stupid pet trick . sure , it's harmless enough , but the frantic amalgamation of disparate elements gave me a headache . it's a bit frightening to note that the original buddy's trainer kevin dicicco is putting together another project , air bud : the next generation . perhaps in the course of teaching a new dog a new trick , he could teach a new screenwriting team one i'd really love to see : how to write a script that might appeal to someone over the age of five . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
1	without any proof , ellen fails to believe him . the story had a lot of holes in it , including an inadequate explanation for budd's motivation for wanting dorothy dead in the first place , but it still played as a good nightmarish mystery yarn , with an icy robert wagner tremendous in a villain role for a change of pace from his usual good guy roles . 
2	few of us who call ourselves " adults " truly remember the experience of childhood , except as a dim and distant illusion . oh , we can recall what we did as a child , and often our memories of that period are among our most precious , but , looking back , we view things through the haze of maturity . every once in a while , however , something comes along that breaks through that filter -- a movie , a scene on television , a page in a book , or a moment in real life . jacques doillon's ponette is one such catalyst . by presenting the world through the eyes of a grieving four- year old , ponette manages to do what few motion pictures can -- regress an audience into childhood . i would place ponette in the company of two other recent films that have successfully attempted something similar : dorota kedzierzawska's crows and rebecca miller's angela . in both of those movies , however , the protagonist was older ( 9 in crows , 10 in angela ) , and neither featured a young actress with as much emotional power as victoire thivisol , who plays the title character in this film . ponette works in large part because of its simplicity and realism . the plot is minimal -- just enough to give us a reason to stay with the tiny protagonist for ninety minutes . the film effortlessly takes us into the magical world of a four- year old , where stuffed animals have extraordinary powers , dolls are more than inanimate objects , and god is someone you can talk to and expect an answer from . some of the most memorable moments in ponette center around the innocent conversations of children -- how catholics are different from jews , what it means to be " single " , and how eating a certain candy can make you fall in love forever . for more than eighty minutes , ponette continues strongly , but , in the end , writer/director jacques doillon seems at a loss how to end the movie . his choice , while admittedly cathartic , feels like a cheat . the pseudo-realistic , almost-documentary quality of the film evaporates ; ponette's final scenes jar us out of the fragile reverie generated by what preceded them . fortunately , the contrived ending does little to dampen my enthusiasm for the picture as a whole . when i recall ponette , the first thing i think of is the heartbreakingly pure performance of young victoire thivisol . this is the kind of portrayal that would be labeled as a standout from an actor of any age , but , from someone who's only four , it's astonishing . a share of the credit must be lavished upon doillon -- it takes a masterful film maker to elicit this kind of unforced performance from a child . had thivisol shown a hint of artifice , ponette would not have worked . the strength and consistency of her acting keeps this film on a high level . even if the movie was not so moving and evocative , it would be worth viewing simply for the character that thivisol brings to life . 
2	everyone knows how bad it is to be called a chicken--it could mess up one's self-image worst than the wind can mess up a ducktail haircut for a teenager in the 1950s--as this liberal-inspired social commentary film plunges right into that 1950s eisenhower era mind-set , without trepidation . it's a film that sympathetically sides with the rebellious youths and their befuddled parents , and it doesn't even demonize the police . it airs out the prevalent problems of the mid-'50s for these youngsters ; such as , loneliness , alienation , lack of love , fitting in with their peers , their identity crises , and the lack of communication with their folks . all these well-off kids ride to school together in this open car , acting loud and stupid , proud to be dumb americans . for all its aging and the changing mores of the times and the ever-increasing complexities of modern youth , this creaky film still has a rawness about it , something that is intangible , that gets into your spine and brings out a chill or two , that tells you this dramatization was real . 
2	the previews for muriel's wedding liken this latest australian import to two of its predecessors , strictly ballroom and the adventures of priscilla , queen of the desert . these are inaccurate , not to mention misleading , comparisons . those expecting something light and airy from this tragic-comedy are in for an unpleasant surprise , for , while muriel's wedding has its moments of exhilarating humor , it is , as often as not , downbeat and even mean-spirited . perhaps the best recent antecedent to muriel's wedding is proof . both films are from house/moorhouse productions ( writer/director p . j . hogan is married to co-producer jocelyn moorhouse ) , and , while this film lacks proof's seamless marriage of comedy and drama , there are distinct similarities in tone and pacing . muriel's wedding could easily be viewed as a social commentary thinly disguised as something a little less pretentious . certainly , one is more likely to emerge from this motion picture with a less upbeat attitude than the one resulting from ballroom or priscilla . one of the most pleasant aspects of muriel's wedding is the distinctly unconventional third act . no one seeing this movie will confuse it with a hollywood picture , as it continually flouts the " feel good " formulas that typically characterize this sort of romantic comedy . the ending is far-from-perfect , but it's a great deal better than several obvious alternatives . nevertheless , parts of muriel's wedding are heavy-handed and , as a result , needlessly uncomfortable to view . there are times when hogan almost seems to enjoy belittling and degrading muriel . while it's necessary to understand her low self-image , the director goes to excessive , almost-sadistic , lengths to get his point across . on these occasions , the film becomes a little difficult to endure . balancing these moments are some high-energy scenes , including a wonderful lip-synch of abba's " waterloo " by muriel and rachel , muriel trying on wedding dresses to the tune of " dancing queen " , and an almost- sex scene featuring sofa cushions being unzipped instead of skirts . the soundtrack , featuring at least five abba songs , is effectively energetic , and includes a peter best-arranged instrumental version of " dancing queen " performed by a full orchestra . those who rely on miramax's ads to prepare them for muriel's wedding may be disappointed , but that's not the film's fault . muriel's wedding isn't a perfect comedy , tragedy , or drama , but it contains enough original elements of each to make it worth a look . ultimately , however , individual enjoyment of this picture may be in direct proportion to a viewer's ability to tolerate abba's omnipresent music . 
1	or will it be great riches instead ? waking ned devine suffers from an excess of good concept and casting and a deficit in plot development . scenes of naked octogenarian males on motorcycles are certainly different , which is not the same thing as interesting . a good-spirited film , it features lovely pictures of the irish coastline and countryside . although there is nothing wrong with the picture , it is rarely compelling . without much of an ending , the film basically just stops . we are left with some nice characterizations but a series of missed opportunities in the script development . a pleasant enough movie , it could and should have been more successful . it is not rated but probably would be an r for brief scenes of full-frontal male nudity and would be fine for teenagers . 
1	" i have absolutely no idea what i'm going to do with the rest of my life , " she confesses sadly over a lonely dinner with her husband . although this may sound serious , the out-of-towners , a remake of the 1970 neil simon screenplay , is a comedy , albeit not a particularly funny one . the kellermans are played without much chemistry by steve martin and goldie hawn , who deliver decidedly subpar performances . needless to say , their love life isn't . this is followed by a cliff's notes version of planes , trains & automobiles that lands them broke and luggageless in new york . as directed by sam weisman and written by marc lawrence , the movie is full of missteps and bad judgement . too often in a hurry , few of the jokes are set up properly . gwen , for example , plows into the fulton fish market with her car in the type of scene that you've seen a hundred times before , but it's edited so fast that you're never sure what is supposed to be funny about it . and when a starving george heads for the vending machine , you are so sure that it will jam that , when it does , the result is laugh free . the story does have a few genuinely humorous moments . steve martin does get to strut his stuff in an energetic sequence set in central park . did i mention john cleese's performance as the obsequious hotel manager , who is a secret cross-dresser ? he seems to have dropped in from another movie , which isn't much better than this one . if you've seen the trailers to the out-of-towners , you've already seen most of the best parts of the story . the rest is just lame padding . it is rated pg-13 for sexuality and drug references and would be fine for kids around 12 and up . 
2	bond's attitudes towards women have been modified--although not greatly . also , there's more action in goldeneye than in previous 007 entries--enough to keep a ninety-minute film moving at a frantic pace . unfortunately , this movie isn't ninety minutes long--it's one-hundred thirty , which means that fully one-quarter of goldeneye is momentum-killing padding . despite the mostly-cosmetic alterations , the majority of fans won't be disappointed by pierce brosnan's debut as their favorite spy . moneypenny ( samantha bond ) and q ( played yet again by a visibly aged desmond llewelyn ) remain in the supporting cast , and the familiar musical theme can be detected occasionally infiltrating eric serra's upbeat , modern score . for those who like opening credits , the trademark surrealism , complete with hammer & sickle , guns , and women , is fully in evidence . brosnan has a flair for wit to go along with his natural charm ; dalton was stoic and sober . of course , the newest bond doesn't come close to sean connery's definitive portrayal , but he lacks the fatuousness that marred roger moore's tenure . brosnan's approach has invigorated 007 enough to overcome a movie that seemingly never wants to end . the story is standard fare , mixing and matching cliches of the genre . brosnan is supported by an interesting troupe of actors , but the spotlight is always on him . goldeneye keeps bond's comic book-like stunts at an appropriately absurd level . even given that we're in a reality where spies are more like superman than bernard samson ( len deighton's popular mi6 agent ) , suspension of disbelief occasionally becomes a challenge , especially with visual effects that could be charitably called " subpar . " some such liabilities , however , can be forgiven in the name of fun . and , with its mixture of humor , interesting locales , high-speed chases , explosions , and action , goldeneye possesses that quality . it is perhaps the best entry in the series since the spy who loved me , and , while that's not saying much , this updated bond should be able to stand toe-to-toe with today's crop of heroes . 
2	spike lee's publicist sent me an unsolicited press video with the goal of fostering knowledge of the film and building demand that it be shown more widely than it has been those far . from spike lee's very first movie , she's gotta have it , he has demonstrated fresh and interesting approaches to standard material . although his do the right thing , for which he won an academy award for the writing , is arguably his best known film , his picture malcolm x , staring denzel washington , remains my personal favorite . spike lee's first documentary , 4 little girls , certainly ranks among his best films . in one part of the historic film footage in the movie the rev . martin luther king calls birmingham the most segregated city in america . these white and colored signs were not to be treated lightly . the film does not ascribe any subsequent actions to these good intentions . the reaction by bull and his crew was swift and predictable . the film would have been better served with more details of the trial , particularly the investigation leading up to it . also , too much footage is devoted to names like bill cosby and ozzie davis who show up mainly to add star power to the picture . lee's powerful film works best in the stock footage from the past for no words can adequately describe what happened then . the film is not rated but would be pg for mature themes . the picture would be fine for any child old enough to be interested in its subject matter . 
1	screenplay : lawrence kasdan . producers : charles okun and lawrence kasdan . director : lawrence kasdan . mpaa rating : r ( adult themes , drug use , profanity , nudity , sexual situations ) running time : 111 minutes . lawrence kasdan has grown to adore narrative sprawl . he attracted wonderful actors because he wrote wonderful parts , but he seemed little interested in making those parts part of a whole . sometimes ( the big chill , silverado , grand canyon ) those untamed scripts still turned into satisfying episodic films ; sometimes ( the accidental tourist , wyatt earp ) they turned into meandering acting showcases . mumford , kasdan's latest exercise in free-form ensemble , has the germ of a great story at the core of his narrative . . . and he promptly drowns that germ in the pencillin of his herky-jerky directing . though his therapy brings results , his credentials aren't exactly conventional either . it takes a while before kasdan spills all the beans about doc mumford's back story , but by then you can already see everything that's right and everything that's wrong about mumford . on the plus side -- predictably for a kasdan film -- is the cast , filled with appealing character performers . loren dean's low-key , natural delivery is perfect for the no-nonsense doc mumford , jason lee shows a sweetness far more convincing than it was in kissing a fool , and the radiant hope davis lends her unique gifts to sofie , the chronically fatigued patient for whom doc mumford falls . kasdan drops these characters into the kind of bucolic , milkman-served town that would appeal to anyone looking for a fresh start . it's the ideal set-up for a comic romance with complications . but mumford isn't a comic romance with complications , at least not often enough . though the actors are all fine , their characters are a huge distraction . kasdan certainly needs to show doc mumford's gift for helping people , but he includes far too many such scenes . in the process , he loses track of mumford's backbone , creating a film that bumps along with virtually no flow . that lack of momentum is most evident when it becomes clear that mumford's payoff will be a relationship between mumford and sofie . there are a couple of perfectly charming scenes between dean and davis , but there's no way to anticipate that the film is leading up to a choice based on those scenes . mumford more often plays as a subtle jab at therapy , suggesting that a really good listener who knows something about overcoming troubles is all an unhappy soul really needs . that's an interesting enough concept , but it doesn't exactly make for a satisfying story ; watching doc mumford's patient list hijack the film only emphasizes that mumford should have been about the doctor . the saying goes that there are no small parts , only small actors . lawrence kasdan seems to agree . . . to a fault . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
0	the movie itself is a recycled version of the original as well as every action picture you've ever seen . the video-game level plot can be summarized as : fight . shoot . the reason ? this lets them throw in lots of naked breasts so that the movie can have gratuitous nudity to go along with its gratuitous violence . erin never develops any genuine chemistry , positive or negative , with deveraux . as bad as it gets , which is pretty awful , at least you can say this for universal soldier : the return : it isn't pretentious . why it was released theatrically rather than going direct to late-night cable is its only mystery . 
1	babe is a talking animals picture . now , don't touch that dial ! don't give up before it has a chance to work its charms on you . i need to point out that the plot of this movie has a striking resemblance to the recent major critical bomb called gordy , but this is not that movie . moreover , although it starts slow , babe's inherent sweetness will hook you . it is a hard movie not to like if you do not give up the ghost in the beginning . they are not amused . be warned , seriously , that many kids may leave this movie wanting to become vegetarians . the movie consists of the twists and turns of her life as future bacon vs . a sheep dog athlete . the acting by cromwell is straight out of grant wood's " american gothic " except here the farm looks english , although it was actually filmed in new south wales in australia . cromwell gives a monotonic and yet interesting performance at the same time . a more animated and better job is done by szubanski . the special effects are realistic and the voices of the animals are well cast . the cinematography is the best part of the movie . sometimes it is so dramatic you think you are watching tara in gone with the wind . the music score performed by the victorian philharmonic orchestra is equally dramatic with loud horns and winds playing in key scenes . the script is by mad max writer george miller , and it is quite funny in parts . it starts slow , but don't walk out or give up . it will work its magic on you . it is an extremely well crafted show , especially for its genre . it is correctly rated g . there is no sex , nudity , violence , smoking , drinking , or cuss words . one animal used the word " butt " once and my son went wild with laughter . finally , one minor animal does die , but it is handled well . i think any aged kid could see babe , and i recommend it for them as well as the young at heart of any age . jeffrey ( age 6 ) got a little scared in a few parts as he frequently does , but loved the show overall and gave it a double thumbs up . this is a good family film . it gets * * 1/2 in my book . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : august 4 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	this is a movie without plot and with precious little characterization . it moves along at a snail's pace , progressively losing more and more of the audience as it becomes apparent that absolutely nothing is going to happen . the long day closes is very much the visual equivalent of a verse or a poem : beautiful images , but no narrative ( that's not to imply that poems often don't have deeper meanings ) . this movie is a visual feast and a cinematographer's dream , but for the average movie-goer , eighty-three minutes of odd camera-angles and interesting shots is too much . the audience at the showing i attended numbered about twenty at the start of the film . personally , i don't think the movie was bad enough to walk out on , but i can understand why those who left did so . movies can survive without coherent stories if they have solid , three-dimensional characters . the long day closes has neither and , as a result , ends up being an overly-long bore . numerous opportunities for character development are left dangling , and we're forced to watch a bunch of people we never get to feel for . even bud , who's in nearly every scene , is flat and uninteresting . that's an interesting notion , and in the context of the movie , it's easy to see how this could be the case- a great deal of attention is paid to the smallest details . unfortunately , except in unusual circumstances , the mundane recollections of a person aren't the kinds of cinematic gems designed to captivate an audience . there are a few incidents in the long day closes that briefly caught my attention , but they couldn't hold it . on those rare occasions when the film managed to strike a responsive chord within me , it let the opportunity slip away . then it was back to staring at meaningless images on the screen again . i can't recommend the long day closes to any but the most devout art film students and die-hard lovers of unusual cinematography . for anyone else that happens to see this movie , they will likely find the title a fitting one . after getting out of the theater , it will certainly seem like it's been a long day . 
2	when he was starting out , he made many excellent but less controversial movies , including jagged edge and that perennial favorite , flashdance . before the house lights went down at the press screening for eszterhas's most recent film , telling lies in america , i read through the press kit . apparently this was supposed to be a touching little film about a teenage immigrant's experience growing up in america and was a " semi-auto-biographical tale . " by the time the house lights had come back up , i was surprised to have found that the film was exactly as billed . the story had many opportunities to get outlandish and rejected them all in favor of serious character development . although far from an outstanding film , the people in it will touch your heart . set in cleveland in the rock 'n roll year of 1960 , the movie tells the story of an itinerant disk jockey whose current pseudonym is billy magic . although bacon's charismatic performance dominates the film , brad renfro as karchy jonas gets more of the screen time . renfro and bacon worked together in last year's outstanding but underappreciated sleepers . renfro's serious character contrasts nicely with billy's flashy persona . even when the story saddens , as it does frequently , the high energy music of the era gives the story its hopeful underpinnings . " why you got to show off so much ? " in a revealing reply , he says it's " cause i ain't got that much to show . " the dialog , while rarely memorable , has a honesty that sounds like it was lifted straight from a time capsule . " have you done the nasty yet ? " karchy lies rather than reveal the truth . after seeing too many films lately in which none of the characters are drawn sympathetically , it is refreshing to have one in which they are all worth caring about . even if billy is conning everyone , you can't help but love him . it is rated pg-13 for sexual situations and some profanity . the film would be fine for kids twelve and up . 
0	there is nothing quite as sad for someone who loves movies as watching a rookie film-maker who really wants to say something , but turns out not to have very much to say , or appears unable to say it in a way that connects . she has a sundance institute-approved screenplay , and all the studied quirkiness she can fit into 89 minutes . but krueger has created a predictable story with characters who still look like they exist on 3x5 notecards on her desk . manny & lo is a comedy-drama without enough of either . i suppose one of the things which irritated me most about manny & lo is that for an ostensibly original independent film , its basic premise has been done and done and done again . as comedy , think of ruthless people ; as social drama , think of last year's white man's burden . and those are just recent examples of stories which make the very psych 101 observation that kidnapers and their hostages aren't always so different , and sometimes bond to fulfill their respective needs . manny & lo doesn't offer much of a twist on the movie truism that if the plot is about a kidnapping , abductors and abducted will go from antagonism to uneasy truce to friendship . there wasn't a moment when i didn't know exactly where krueger was taking me . mary kay place , a much more experienced performer , turns elaine into something intriguing almost in spite of krueger . i think there is a tendency to give first-timers the benefit of the doubt on independent projects like this , because critics are usually aware of the limitations of time and money . i'm not sure that any of that matters to the audience . lisa krueger's intentions are good ; she wants to explore what can make a dysfunctional family functional , and how whether or not you perceived your family as dysfunctional can determine the effect it has on you . she also leaves threads dangling , introduces characters who do little or nothing to advance the story ( like cameron boyd as the terribly cute chuck , who hands out his signature to manny ) , and doesn't direct her script with an eye to making either the humor or the relationships as effective as they might have been . manny & lo is a slow , rather simple and not terribly entertaining film , and that doesn't change because krueger is inexperienced , or a woman , or not working for a major studio . 
1	owing more than just a nod to quentin tarantino's reservoir dogs , gary fleder's things to do in denver when you're dead tries to tell the same sort of hip tale about sympathetic gangsters whose crime goes horribly wrong . a lot is missing however -- the snappy , polished dialogue ; the tense , gritty atmosphere ; and the nearly-perfect pacing . things to do is a wannabe that never quite makes it . that's not to say it's all bad , however . the film introduces us to jimmy the saint ( andy garcia ) , a slick ex-gangster with style , class , and some great pickup lines . the first half of things to do is an unoriginal-but-entertaining tale of gangster-types botching a crime . many of the settings will be familiar to followers of film noir , and much of the self-consciously cool dialogue is derivative of , albeit inferior to , tarantino's . after the movie's midpoint , however , things go in the wrong direction . the poorly-paced second hour features a lot of aimless running around and talking punctuated by bursts of bloody action that don't signify much . most of the characters who get axed haven't been fleshed out enough to capture our sympathy , so it's easy to shrug off their deaths as a waste of screen time . the only one we care about is jimmy , and his motives and intentions become increasingly murky as things to do moves towards its predictable conclusion . treat williams is wildly energetic as bill , a nutcase with an itchy trigger finger . williams chews on the scenery a little , delivering lines like " i'm godzilla and you're japan ! " with suitable gusto . as is true of his beautiful girls script , scott rosenberg's screenplay is largely a pastiche of themes and ideas from other , better pictures . this movie has been assembled with enough aptitude to offer two hours' tepid entertainment , but it's not nearly as clever as the title suggests . a few too many characters and scenes in things to do in denver when you're dead lack life and luster , making fleder's film more of a pretender than a contender in a field that includes superior entries like reservoir dogs and the usual suspects . 
1	screenplay : andy breckman and michael leeson . director : fred schepisi . a movie like i . q . is like a souffle . when you're trying to mix whimsy , romance , comedy and ( of all things ) physics together , the whole recipe can collapse under its own weight without the right chef . director fred schepisi made all the right decisions in 1987's roxanne , a film that could have been either cloying or tedious in the wrong hands . i . q . isn't quite as successful as roxanne , but it is far more entertaining than it has any right to be . while it's rarely laugh-out-loud funny , it's pleasant , low-key and consistently charming . it's not easy to describe exactly why i . q . works , because in many ways it's extremely simple and predictable . there are the standard complications , and none of them are particularly hilarious . i think i . q . 's greatest strength may be that it uses its premise to perfection . einstein isn't part of the story simply as high-concept gag ; love really does become a kind of physics formula , and its incorporation into the story is delightful . matthau is a marvelous einstein , a gentle matchmaker with a twinkle in his eye . the running commentary they provide on philosophy , science and love is a goofy little trick that turns them into an almost fantastical greek chorus . it's exactly what schepisi was able to do with roxanne : keep the tone light and coax fine supporting performances out of every last supporting character . of course , a romantic comedy is generally only as successful as the chemistry between its stars , so how do ryan and robbins fare together ? quite well , and that's mostly because screenwriters andy breckman and michael leeson take their time bringing them together . this is far from ryan's best work -- i thought she was coasting much of the time -- but a mediocre ryan is still worth a lot in a role like this . robbins , on the other hand , turns in one of his most appealing performances yet . many of his previous roles have been one-note jobs , either simpletons or sleazes , but ed is a warm and engaging character which shows that robbins has a bright future as a romantic leading man . their scenes together may not set the screen on fire , but they are comfortable enough together that the smiles just keep coming . i didn't expect much from i . q . , and it really didn't deliver all that much . i just had fun , and i left with a smile . it doesn't take a genius to realize that achievement is worth a compliment . 
0	a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent , but one with no edge to it . it turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich ? s and stock characters of this genre . though it's a well-written and well-acted fluff piece , it still does not have too much to say that is surprising . it's made for the gentle art-house set , those who don't want something too disturbing to think about . the film looked like the usual sitcom stuff , and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie . the film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium , and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax . the only thing that couldn't be sold , is this stiff story and tired plot line . the mystery to me , is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy . it ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one , as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper . 
1	argentinean director martin rejtman's quirky little comedy , silvia prieto , consists of a series of such subplots . i don't know if linguists have studied the speed of delivery of various languages , but i've always had a theory that spanish lends itself to some of the most rapid elocution possible . the characters in silvia prieto have a lot to say , and the poor subtitler can barely keep up . i suspect that the subtitles represent a vastly abbreviated version of the dialog so i fear that the movie will not play as well with non-spanish speaking audiences . nevertheless , the film does have some nice moments in it for those of us who aren't conversant in spanish . she buries her money , and she makes a point of always turning on the hot air dryer in the restroom , even if she's too busy to dry her hands . given this scenario , what would be more appropriate than to show brite the video of their wedding . the deadpan humor takes this all very seriously and naturally . gabriel has many quirks but none more so than his deodorant habit . he also manages the undoable when he simultaneously drops acid , smokes pot and drinks whiskey while staying absolutely clearheaded and articulate . after a series of funny little episodes , the movie ends abruptly . there is a video of the first silvia prieto club meeting , which isn't the least bit funny and feels tacked on as almost an afterthought . the film is in spanish with english subtitles . it is not rated but would be an r for drug usage , sexual situations and a little profanity and would be fine for older teenagers . 
1	this bizarre supernatural art-horror film is the first feature with all dialogue recorded in esperanto ( an artificial international language created in the 1800s so everyone in the world could speak in the same tongue ) . there are english subtitles . it's a gorgeously photographed b/w film by cinematographer conrad hall ; a spooky tale about murderous sea creatures . it's filled with hokum , as it tells about the battle for souls between the god of light and the god of darkness . guess who wins ? this thin story has merit , as it casts a spellbinding effect over its eerie doings and strange surroundings . if its strangeness you are seeking , or a cultish horror film from the 1960s that is an oddity , or if you are a fan of horror films , then this is the film for you . others might not be so taken with the strange events taking place , events that seem more nutty than real ; and , they might not be taken by shatner's stiff performance . i found this b film engaging in an ingmar bergman way , but without the swedish director's ability to tell a better story . but , the film deserves an audience beyond its cultish fans . 
0	new york knicks fans , still smarting from a lackluster season and second-round playoff ejection , may find some solace in eddie , a fantasy for big apple nba fans . just about everyone else is likely to find this smug , self-congratulatory , moronic comedy unbearable . whoopi goldberg doesn't exactly have a sterling track record , but this particular travesty resembles a pile left by the runaway elephant in made in america . whoopi plays eddie franklin , a rabid knicks fan ( very much in the mold of the celtics fans from the infinitely better celtic pride ) . and , of course , the sorry knicks start to get better just as the season winds down . there's a bit of contrived melodrama at the end that tries to fake the audience into thinking that the result of the game might be in doubt , but we know better . this topic is a good launching pad for satire , but eddie does nothing with it . it's just a plot device cooked up by one of the six credited screenwriters . ( when has a script written by so many been any good ? ) the character of eddie is one of the film's worst miscalculations . we're supposed to like her , but , with goldberg exhibiting all the loud , loutish arrogance of the stereotypical knicks fan , we end up wishing for her downfall . quite a few past and current nba players ( walt frazier , john salley , dwayne schintzius , and dennis rodman ) make appearances , but their ( thankfully ) limited exposure does little more than prove that they're considerably more effective on court than on screen . those offended by the rampant commercialism of motion pictures ( disney and its subsidiaries are particularly guilty of this ) will find much in eddie to raise their ire . there are a couple of clever moments in eddie , such as a scene where a player offers a scientifically accurate definition of a black hole ( this echoes the " civilized " right guard commercials ) , but this film offers very few laughs . it's a dull , stale affair with suspenseless game sequences , humorless jokes , and pathetic drama . in short , unless you're craving a knicks fantasy triumph , eddie is one summer movie to stay far away from . 
2	screenplay : steve barancik . director : john dahl . the last seduction also made its first appearance on cable earlier this year , but from the looks of things , dahl will be able to make a few films directly for the big screen if he so chooses . film noir has been a hot genre lately , and few directors with more established reputations are making them better than john dahl . the last seduction is a wonderfully nasty piece of work , sparked by linda fiorentino's bad-to-the-bone lead performance . the critical error many recent film noir attempts have made ( the abysmal color of night comes most quickly to mind ) is that they operate on the premise that all you need are minimalist lighting and a few plot twists to maintain audience interest . characters become props holding up a plot , rather than the elements that drive the plot . dahl and screenwriter steve barancik do not make that error . in order for the last seduction to work to the fullest , berg has to convince us that there's a reason besides simple naivete that he stays with bridget , and he makes mike's need genuine . occasionally , that seems to be the case . because barancik deliberately avoids providing us with any easy motivation for bridget's actions ( a troubled childhood , for example ) , her calculation becomes a bit difficult to swallow in one gulp . but fiorentino is so alive in this part that she makes bridget real , and her glee is infectuous . the last seduction's plot does have the requisite twists , turns and surprises , but none of them are particularly jaw-dropping . dahl and barancik are more concerned with tone and character , and deliver in both categories . but if there is one aspect of the story which is truly impressive , it is what * doesn't * happen . the formulaic qualities of so many movies have conditioned us to expect a comeuppance for characters like bridget at a specific plot point ; however , at crucial moments when it seems that she's made a critical mistake , she's still one step ahead . clockwork plots like the last seduction can sometimes seem too contrived for their own good , and some viewere might find it simply too cold . many others will find fiorentino and the last seduction the perfect antidote to the recent glut of stylish but vacuous blockbusters . 
2	directed by gary fleder , this entertaining thriller delivers the goods . sure , it follows a fairly standard formula , but you won't mind . there are just enough twists to keep you guessing , and the acting is solid from famke janssen , as jessie's temporarily incapacitated mother , to sean bean , as the omnipresent leader of the kidnappers . fleder , as he did in kiss the girls , keeps you on your toes and ready to be frightened , even if things rarely do go " boo ! " it is anticipation that causes chills not actions . although it is a satisfying film , it's not a flawless one . the script by patrick smith kelly and anthony peckham , based on andrew klavan's novel , has some easily fixed problems and troubling logical holes . and in the missed opportunity category , why do the writers take the time to setup an elaborate mystery around elisabeth's mental condition and then immediately solve it ? what's the rush ? among the film's most satisfying twists is the story's final resolution . in this , the writers don't disappoint . don't say a word runs 1 : 40 . it is rated r for " violence , including some gruesome images , and language " and would be acceptable for teenagers . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
1	this pleasing film plays like a docudrama , with the director youssef chahine playing himself in the film . he feels amr is an even better actor than he was , and therefore feels hurt that amr is threatening to walk away from this part . chahine said he was quite sure that he was talking to him , as he was a young man sitting intently in the audience , quite in awe of the great actor . yet , when the shoot is over , amr tells how kind and considerate the director could be when off the set . it reminded me of a jacques rivette musical , mixing reality and fantasy into a scene where you wouldn't think it possible to do so . cahine goes on to make two more pictures in this film within a film , alexandria and cleopatra . the scenes are colorfully shot on a studio location , while it also shows him writing and directing the actors , as they go from song and dance numbers into serious acting sketches . the creative , political and personal struggles of the filmmaker were well-presented and superbly acted , in this imaginative and enchanting production . it is a zesty film , adopting many different themes and styles , from gene kelly dance numbers to fellini fantasy scenes . 
2	in looking for richard , actor/director al pacino expressed his greatest hope for the film -- that he could extend his enthusiasm for the bard's plays to a broader audience . luhrmann hasn't fashioned this motion picture with the stodgy , elitist shakespeare " purist " in mind . instead , by incorporating lively , modern imagery with a throbbing rock soundtrack and hip actors , he has taken aim at an audience that would normally regard shakespeare as a chore to be endured in school , not a passionate drama to ignite the screen . make no mistake , this romeo and juliet isn't the match of franco zeffirelli's unforgettable 1968 classic . while leonardo dicaprio and claire danes make an effective couple , their romance doesn't burn with the white-hot intensity of leonard whiting and olivia hussey's . nevertheless , this interpretation is so fundamentally different from anything to have come before it that there's no danger of repetition . by the director's own admission , this is a created world , borrowing aspects of its unique visual style from such diverse periods as the 1940s , 1970s , and 1990s , and using a variety of classic films ( most notably rebel without a cause ) for inspiration . the resulting hybrid background is startling . romeo and juliet's camera is restless , always moving . there are times when the rapid cuts and raging soundtrack might cause understandable confusion between the movie and a rock video . indeed , with all the camera tricks , special effects ( such as a roiling storm ) , and riotous splashes of color , it's easy to lose the story in the style . luhrmann's intent was never to drown shakespeare's dialogue in technique , but it happens , especially early in the film . in the process , the more subtle intangibles of the romance are irretrievably lost . it's a delicately romantic moment whose magic is never quite matched by any other scene in the film . danes makes a breathtaking juliet , merging strength and fragility into one . the supporting cast has its share of successes and failures . john leguizamo plays a particularly effective tybalt , juliet's latino cousin . despite a terrible accent , miriam margolyes gives a delightful interpretation of juliet's nurse . in a daring move that works , harold perrineau's mercutio is presented as a high-energy drag queen who gets a chance to strut his stuff to a disco tune with shakespearean lyrics . brian dennehy's presence is , as always , imposing , but , as lord montague , he doesn't have more than a handful of lines . and a pair of characters , paul rudd's paris and jesse bradford's balthasar , are so ineffectual that they're virtually invisible . there are moments of comedy in shakespeare's play , and luhrmann tries to transfer some of these over , in addition to adding a few of his own . one in particular , with romeo ineptly scaling a trellis for the famous balcony sequence , is ill-placed . also , there are times when the director gets a little too cute . a run-down theater in verona is called " the globe " ( the name of the locale where shakespeare's plays were originally performed ) , and the astute viewer will catch visual references to " the merchant of verona beach " , " rozencranzky's " , " wherefore l'amour " , and " out , out damn spot cleaners " . ultimately , no matter how many innovative and unconventional flourishes it applies , the success of any adaptation of a shakespeare play is determined by two factors : the competence of the director and the ability of the main cast members . and , while such a loud , brash interpretation may not go down in cinematic history as the definitive version of the play , hopefully it will open a few eyes and widen the audience willing to venture into any movie bearing the credit " based on the play by william shakespeare .

2	i have no doubt that grand canyon will be my best movie of 1991 . what is the plot of grand canyon ? hard to say . it is about a lot of things . in short it is about life . grand canyon is set in la , but it could have been set anywhere . the movie's title comes from a wish of one of the characters played by danny glover . it was most of all a film full of wonderful characters that you would like personally to meet . i hope the writers get the oscar for it . the directing is super . it was done by lawrence kasdan who did the big chill , and you can think of it as a much more serious and heavy big chill . alternatively , you can view it as updated big chill for the 90s . grand canyon is full of characters and full of events that make you think of real life and not movies . imagine a left turn against heavy traffic that is really scary and realistic and not the laugh track version you have come to expect . this is also a quite scary movie with a fair amount of fear and blood . yet this was a life affirming and fundamentally happy movie that made you want to immediately give your spouse ( and children and friends ) a big hug . i had no idea steve martin could be an articulate and serious character . there is one very bad side to the show : it ends ! the ending is fine and not abrupt yet i wanted to go on for hours . i love these people . grand canyon runs 2 : 15 which might be too long in a lessor picture , but here i wish the editor carol littleton had included even more footage . grand canyon is rated r for some reason and i guess it is the fear and the bad language . certainly it would be fine for any teenager . i recommend this film strongly to everyone over the age of 12 and award it my top rating of * * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	it's one of many miscalculations made by the director , because , when the end credits roll , we're left without a sense of closure . for the most part , basquiat works as a series of anecdotes , but not as a deeper portrait . despite the screen time afforded to jeffrey wright , who gives a superlative performance , we never really connect with the painter . in terms of feeling for basquiat , this picture left me cold . schnabel also appears to have a mercenary motive that makes parts of his film seem indulgent . although schnabel probably intended the movie as a tribute to a celebrated colleague , his self-promotion lends a distasteful aura to the proceedings . one area where basquiat succeeds is in its portrayal of the artificial , exploitative forces that encircled basquiat , sucked him in , and eventually spit him out . since schnabel moved in the same circles , it's not surprising that he would understand , and be able to effectively portray , this aspect of the artist's experience . using scenes that are pointed and nearly satirical in tone , schnabel details the double- dealing and boot-licking that surrounds successful artists -- how honey- tongued sycophants and hangers-on replace friends and lovers . basquiat boasts a gallery of superlative performances . wright's basquiat is animated , passionate , and deserving of a better script than he was granted ( the tony award-winning actor is on record as having disagreed with schnabel's interpretation of how the role should be played ) . and david bowie is every bit as good as jared harris ( i shot andy warhol ) as the effeminate , enigmatic warhol . every once in a while , basquiat strikes a real nerve with statements like " [dealers] are no longer collecting art ; [they're] buying people " or " [basquiat's] audience hasn't even been born yet . " the film doesn't do a total autopsy of the art business , but it affords enough glimpses to enable us to read between the lines . unfortunately , schnabel doesn't have the same success plumbing the secrets of basquiat's soul . for a subject with such depth and passion , it's sad that schnabel's treatment is so uneven . 
0	the other distinguished party in this revenge oater , is daniel b . ullman , a noted " b " western script specialist , whose unique stories were used in a multitude of westerns in that era . . . . if you want to see a western , one like they don't make anymore , this is as good a representative as most . 
0	the feature debut of director kevin allen is exceptionally profane , frequently violent , and occasionally grotesque , which all adds up to a reasonably high " hipness " quotient in a genre where quentin tarantino is king . ultimately , however , like so many wannabes , twin town lacks several key ingredients that its predecessor possessed -- notably style , originality , and depth . cue the opening credits . unfortunately , the movie's satirical sophistication never again approaches this level . the world we're plunged into is gray and flat , and allen's presentation of it is too-often uninspired . outlandishness for its own sake isn't interesting , just as a film's status as a " black comedy " doesn't excuse its multitude of flaws . trainspotting was an explosion of creative edginess ; twin town rarely provokes anything more enthusiastic than a yawn . allen's movie , which takes place in swansea , wales ( called , appropriately enough , " the graveyard of ambition " by dylan thomas ) , introduces us to a cast of characters who could have been lifted out of a bad monty python sketch ( one of those where you wonder how such a talented troupe could come up with something so unfunny ) . in spite of their car-stealing hobby , glue-sniffing habits , and violent tendencies , the de facto protagonists , julian and jeremy , are easily the two most dreary people that we meet ( the director has aptly described them as intentionally two-dimensional ) . twin town commits a black comedy cardinal sin by believing that it's a lot more incisive and funny than it actually is . in fact , the term " boring " wouldn't be out of place as a descriptor of the endless first half . that's because , at least early on , twin town is just about a bunch of off-putting , undeveloped characters doing a variety of dodgy things . we've seen it all before ; it's time to offer a new twist . the dialogue is passably interesting for only one reason : it's easily the most profane i have ever encountered on screen ( there are something like 500 uses of the " f " word , or one of its permutations ) . the plot -- or what passes for one -- is pointless and occasionally muddled ( especially near the beginning ) . the good news is that twin town gets markedly better during its second half . twin town invites comparisons to other movies because it's not absorbing enough on its own to grab an audience's attention . none of the characters are of great interest and the acting is of variable quality . the film apparently played well overseas , which is good for its financial stability , because it's unlikely to make much of a dent in the summer box office on this side of the atlantic . for a movie that deals with doubles , twin town barely has half of what it needs to make for compelling viewing . 
1	director : wolfgang petersen . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 136 minutes . the amazing thing about sebastian junger's best-selling non-fiction book the perfect storm was that it created an enthralling , page-turning story out of two less-than-pulse-pounding subjects : fishing and weather . even more surprising , perhaps , was the manner in which he chose to make those subjects readable . rather than creating a de facto novel about the people involved in the events , junger dives into journalistic detail . he immerses the reader so completely in the hard lives of swordfishermen as a culture that it's never necessary for him to over-dramatize the individual lives he's focusing on . as for the weather , he is similarly successful at creating specifics out of generalities . for junger , tension and adventure came from the simple facts . instead , he chose melodramatic twaddle . it's not an easy job wittliff has taken on , because there's no obvious through-line for junger's account to take as a screen story . the book effectively conveyed the personal and physical toll exacted by a fisherman's life , and for a while it appears that wittliff is pointing the story in the right direction . the perfect storm could have been set up as a seafaring twister , with stick figure characters wrapped in cool meteorological special effects . this film , at least , has its heart in the right place . its dialogue , however , could not be more wrong , wrong , wrong . perhaps panicked over how to make a journalistic account " engaging " for viewers , the makers of the perfect storm apparently gave bill wittliff the following instructions for writing his characters : " imagine a particularly bad romance novel with a $100 million budget . " they say things like , " there's only love ; " they say things like , " you're heading right into the mouth of the monster ! ; " for all the verisimilitude wittliff pumps into the conversations , the fishermen might as well have spent two hours growling " arrgh , matey " to one another . if not for the thrillingly staged final hour , the perfect storm might have been a total loss . as it stands , it's just on the border of worth a look . director wolfgang petersen stages the andrea gail's perilous journey with the kind of tension that finds you pulling yourself into a ball in your seat ; there's also a strangely effective scene involving a mid-air refueling attempt for a rescue helicopter thwarted by the intense winds . it's purely visceral film-making , mind you , but it's very good visceral film-making , and at least you don't have to worry about listening to the next ridiculous thing to come out of someone's mouth . it's ironic , because the perfect storm had the potential to be a powerfully human story in spite of showy visual effects and adventure set pieces . instead , it's only worth watching for its visual effects and adventure set pieces . the storm itself is perfect ; the purple prose journey towards that storm makes you long for a bit more journalistic distance . or at least for someone to fiddle with the sound mix so the wind drowned out every word . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	screenplay : amy schor & vicki polon . director : anthony minghella . sometimes , it's all about state of mind . either you're ready to enjoy a certain kind of movie , or you're not . i can envision a different set of circumstances under which i might have walked away from mr . wonderful with eyes rolling and a groan of " puh-leez . " but i didn't . instead , i found it to be a warm and charming lightweight romance , full of appealing performances and well-directed moments of tiny heartbreak . nothing about that premise screams originality . feuding exes who still carry a torch have been fodder for most daytime and nighttime soaps for ever . the relative success of mr . wonderful is attributable almost entirely to the cast . dillon is an extremely likable lug ; sciorra has the tense charm of a woman just discovering herself . their scenes together work to perfection because they manage to be thoroughly convincing as two people who have know each other , as lee notes , " practically since i was born . " they shift naturally between civil conversation and petty bickering , creating a genuine sense of history between them , and it's extremely entertaining to watch . it was the frequency of moments like that one which ultimately won me over to caring about these characters . parker has one of the most expressive mouths in films , and she uses it to show more different shades of emotion than she has lines . i also enjoyed david barry gray , who has an endearing puppy-dog energy about him as gus's best friend pope . this is not to say that all of the characters worked all the time . vincent d'onofrio only gets three scenes to develop what ends up being a rather important character , and consequently seems to try a bit too hard to make dominic angelic . and yes , dillon does have some overplayed moments , making gus's " hidden emotions " far too obvious for anyone with half a brain , or even a notochord . director anthony minghella , who gave us the low-key supernatural romance truly , madly , deeply , seems to have a knack for finding slices of real emotion without resorting to schmaltz . i was genuinely touched by a small moment involving a woman waiting for a blind date from a personals ad , as well as a brief conversation between rita and lee . however , these same moments also made me wonder whether mr . wonderful had missed an opportunity to be a more wide-ranging examination of everyone's search for a mr . or mr . wonderful , and what people are willing to do or give up for that chance . as it stands , the focus on the specific still held my attention . mr . wonderful is no work of art , but it's gentle and affirming and it caught me on a good day . kindly check in your cynicism at the door . 
1	illuminata , directed by john turturro , would appear to have it all : lavish sets , intimate cinematography , nostalgic atmosphere , captivating music and a large and accomplished cast . and yet ? with acting talent that includes john turturro , katherine borowitz , christopher walken , susan sarandon , beverly d'angelo , bill irwin , rufus sewell , georgina cates , matthew sussman and ben gazzara , how could it go wrong ? the result is some cute bits that fly by , leaving a laugh here and a memorable line there , but never adding up to anything . the picture simply never comes close to jelling . the movie's script by brandon cole and john turturro relies heavily on sight gags for the slapstick comedy . like the rest of the movie , these scenes form little more than curiosity pieces . the best humor comes from the way the movie pokes fun at the flamboyant theater critic , bevalaqua ( walken ) . people don't know whether they really like a play until they've read his opinion . " that's what critics are for , to tell us . " " that's because he makes mistakes , " bevalaqua points out . like the woman's license plate that reads , " so many men , so little time , " the movie parades a host of characters in front of us . but it never takes the time to develop any of them . although the movie has its faults , turturro's love of the theater is palpably shown . too bad he couldn't have slowed down some and thought more about the needs of his audience . eliminating many of the characters and fleshing out the ones left would have been a start . it is rated r for sex , nudity and language and would be fine for older teenagers . 
1	despite its enormously entertaining action sequences and generally high level of energy , drop zone has a major draw back : it doesn't make sense . this is a classic example of a script apparently constructed as an afterthought to accommodate the skydiving , fight , and chase scenes . the plot , to put it frankly , is complete rubbish , with far too much time devoted to fruitless attempts at explaining and developing it . most recently , skydiving was used to drive terminal velocity , and , while no one is going to nominate drop zone for an award , it's a more enjoyable way to spend ninety-plus minutes--assuming you're for some reason forced to choose between the two . then again , no matter what the arena , wesley snipes can act rings around charlie sheen , and john badham ( wargames ) is a somewhat more accomplished director than velocity's deran sarafian . as the so-called story moves along , you keep expecting this to happen , but it never does . then again , perhaps the script pages developing the relationship got lost along with the half screenplay that never made it into the movie . talk about disjointed . . . . for a moment , shortly into drop zone , it's possible to wonder if you've somehow stumbled into passenger 57 . there's snipes on a plane again , and something involving bullets and blood is about to happen . there's nothing original or interesting about gary busey's character--this is the kind of role he's done so often that he could probably sleepwalk his way through it , chomping on scenery all the way . snipes isn't exactly breaking new ground , either , but he at least seems to be putting a little more effort into the part--and he's got a flashier wardrobe . just because drop zone won't put you to sleep doesn't mean that it's worth seeing . even as a pure popcorn picture , it lacks a certain minimum level of coherence . the above represents the opinions of the author , and not necessarily those of bellcore or any organization within bellcore . 
0	it is an almost no budget film that was made on location in new jersey about an hour from where i lived for many years . if you like quirky shows , the plot of this one has great potential . personally , i love this type of picture . in fact some of my favorite movies are sherman's march , always : but not necessarily forever , my dinner with andre , 35 up , eating raoul , and house of games--which all qualify as very strange and off-beat . clerks was filmed in a grainy black and white that has numerous contrast problems . the movie was written and directed by kevin smith . the actors seem to all be fresh out of acting 101 , and i will not list their names as i feel sure you know none of them . i read later that the lead actor works in the mailroom at at&t and is still waiting for his break into a movie with a budget . movies like this either work for you or they don't . this one frequently put me to sleep . i know there are better actors in new jersey , i remember seeing some excellent ones in the new jersey shakespeare festival every year . clerks is not a waste however . it is done as a series of vignettes . some of them do work and are quite funny as written if not as acted . if you go to the movie , listen to the dialog and forget the attempt at acting . some of the material is good and for that i award it * 1/2 . i do not recommend this movie to anyone . on the other hand , if you really like strange movies , you might go to this one and find it works for you--good luck . it is the sort of show that could become a cult classic . the movie runs a long 1 : 43 . it has no nudity or violence , but lots of explicit conversations and is correctly rated r . i think it would be acceptable for older teenagers . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	one film critic , tom milne , aptly said that cornel wilde maintains his reputation in this film for making the most likable bad movies around . sharks' treasure is an action-packed nonsense thriller that is very entertaining . in this oddity film , wilde is the producer , writer , director , and star . he could have used someone else to give him some help with the plot and he could have worked more with the supporting cast to make their roles more plausible and meaty . everyone seemed like a cartoon character , as there was no attempt made at character development or for the storyline to make too much sense . the film feels like it's stuck in a strange space-warp , as the all-male treasure hunters are out at sea and are pretty close to going insane . these hombres are bad dudes , bad actors , and bad punsters . this all seems bizarre and hardly real , but it's full of emotion and the action is a hoot to behold . it's a film that has to be seen to be treasured for what it brings up from such a slight story . 
0	a taut little suspense programmer . one that is very watchable , though the twist in the plot is hardly believable . it's not believable that a hardened hitman would confess so easily , but he does . . . what this potboiler had going for it , was a nice look to its b&w shots of the dark streets of london , and through sydney tafler's melodramatic performance , it showed how a killer can be cold-blooded taking care of business and yet be a devoted family man and , though his love for his brother was genuine , it was still misguided . overall , the " b " film had good production values and a satisfying but improbable story to tell . 
0	mr . cahn , in this aip cheapie , provides some amusing hokum exploiting the occult-horror b-film genre in a very hollywood type of way . the act has so far earned them $250 , 000 a piece . the cahn way of filming these seances is more funny than scary . this is strictly lightweight nonsense , which should be good for a few laughs . it is perfect viewing as a saturday matinee . i can't see anyone taking this one seriously . 
1	this is a mark rappaport film , so if you are expecting to see a convential film , you have walked into the wrong theater . his tongue-in-cheek humor is as always , delightfully absurd . all 9 characters play co-starring roles , with no one dominating the film . and it works , in an odd sort of way , making the characters seem connected to each other from the opening strangulation scene until the last scene , even though there is no mention ever made in the movie again of the opening murder . this is a film about troubled characters and a chance for rappaport to direct his weird humor into the inanely funny lines spoken by them , as each character is out of it , in a neurotic way . the characters appear in short skits , trying to relate to each other in bursts of energy , spewing out lame jokes and theories , self-absorbed with their own neurotic tendencies , while many of them are hungering for sex and violence , and answers to puzzles that they may not even be working on . that should cover enough of the plot for any one who needs to know what he is seeing before he determines if he should venture out to rent this on video . all i could honestly say , is that i enjoyed it . it was like a nice cold drink , on a hot summer day , offering me something for my thirst , as i wonder why there is not a greater market for original films like this one , after all , the plot of this film is not completely insane . and as paul so ably says , " everything is a plot , it is just not clear what it is . " 
2	initially dismissed by many serious critics as unworthy of attention or praise , the motion picture looked headed for an oblivion where it would never make back its small , $300 , 000 budget . because of its title , halloween has frequently been grouped together with all the other splatter films that populated theaters throughout the late-1970s and early-1980s . this is not a gruesome motion picture -- there is surprisingly little graphic violence and almost no blood . halloween is built on suspense , not gore , and initiated more than a few of today's common horror/thriller cliches . the ultimate success of the movie , however , encouraged other film makers to try their hand at this sort of enterprise , and it didn't take long for someone to decide that audiences wanted as many explicitly grisly scenes as the running length would allow . by the time halloween's sequel was released in 1981 , the objective of this sort of movie was no longer to scare its viewers , but to gross them out . from a shock-and-suspense point-of-view , halloween is the rival of alfred hitchcock's psycho . with only a few arguable exceptions ( such as the exorcist ) , there isn't another post-1970 release that comes close to it in terms of scaring the living hell out of a viewer . halloween starts out in a creepy fashion with a brutal murder , and never lets up from there . every frame drips with atmosphere . curtis' capable interpretation of the gawky , awkward laurie is frequently overlooked in analyses of the movie and its genre , but she effectively conveys the feelings and aspirations of a shy , insecure teenager . it's hard to believe that the actress would develop ( in more ways than one ) into a woman whose sexual appeal would drive pictures like a fish called wanda . the entire sequence employs the subjective point-of-view , an approach that writer/director john carpenter returns to repeatedly throughout the movie . much has been made of the fact that the key to survival in halloween is being a virgin . co-writers carpenter and debra hill have stated numerous times that this was not a conscious theme , but , ever since halloween , the standard for slasher films has been that sexual promiscuity leads to a violent end . he kills without making a sound or changing his expression , and his movements are often slow and zombie-like . carpenter is exceedingly careful in chosing the camera angles he uses to shoot michael . before the climax , there's never a clear close-up -- he's always concealed by shadows , shown in the distance , or presented as otherwise obscured . this approach makes for an especially ominous villain . subsequent halloweens delved more deeply into michael's origins and his connection to laurie , but , in this one , he remains an enigma , and the lack of a clear motive makes his actions all the more terrifying . another important element of halloween's success is our ability to identify with the trio of female protagonists , and carpenter establishes a rapport between the audience and the characters by employing intelligent , realistic dialogue and placing the girls in believable situations . for laurie , it's making sure the kid she's babysitting is having a good time . halloween is one of those films where the attention to detail is evident in every frame . while there are many memorable moments , three scenes stand out above the rest . often copied , but never equaled , this scene was unique for its time and reminiscent of psycho's shower murder for its effect . to this day , i find these to be the most chilling three minutes of the movie . it's a credit to carpenter that , no matter how many times you've seen the movie , the tension at this point still mounts to a palpable level . despite being relatively simple and unsophisticated , halloween's music is one of its strongest assets . carpenter's dissonant , jarring themes provide the perfect backdrop for michael's activity , proving that a film doesn't need a symphonic score by an a-line composer to be effective . carpenter's halloween main title , one of the horror genre's best-recognizable tunes , can bring chills even away from the theater . the final body count in halloween is surprisingly low ( the immediate sequel , halloween 2 , rectified this matter , but that's another story ) , but the terror quotient is high . this is the kind of impeccably crafted motion picture that burrows deep into our psyche and connects with the dark , hidden terrors that lurk there . halloween is not a perfect movie , but no recent horror film has attained this pinnacle ( as evidenced by the plaudits heaped upon it in wes craven's recent scream ) . halloween remains untouched -- a modern classic of the most horrific kind . " for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake . " 
2	screenplay : joel coen and ethan coen , based on " the odyssey " by homer . director : joel coen . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 107 minutes . funny , but i don't remember them turning up in my western civilizations reading list . if you really want a sense of what the coens are after in o brother , where art thou ? , it helps to know the origin of the title . ultimately , he discovers that people love frivolous comedies , and that there's no shame in creating them . forget epics of the common man ; make them laugh , and you've got them right where you want them , and right where they want to be . i'm not sure i could make an argument for the coens' o brother , where art thou ? being flawless film-making . it is , however , the most utterly demented , unashamedly un-important and purely entertaining film experience i've had all year . essentially , there's nothing to o brother , where art thou ? but a string of comic misadventures . coen brothers characters don't often occupy a particularly moral universe , so there's not really a lesson or point to any of it . it's an exercise in free-form narrative cinema , held together by the coens' distinctive whip-smart dialogue and their gift for putting the right face on every role . and it's constantly , gut-bustingly hilarious . viewers who have been lukewarm to previous coen projects aren't likely to become converts this time around , but if you're in tune with their warped sensibilities , you're in for a treat . is the kind of film you'll spend most of the time watching with your mouth open , either laughing out loud or in dumbfounded amazement at what they're able to put on a screen . and few things are as dumbfoundingly amazing as george clooney's loose-limbed comic performance , the kind of work that forces you to re-think an actor's versatility . in a cast full of great comics and coen film veterans ( turturro , durning , hunter , john goodman ) , clooney steals the show . it happens to be a joyous show he's stealing . somewhere creeping around the edges of o brother is a commentary on our need for religion and mythology even in an " age of reason , " with its combination of greek legend and american folk tales . it would be ridiculous , however , to argue that this is the coens' personal " odyssey . " it dips and swerves , hits its lulls then tears back into remarkably goofy set pieces . there's no important message here , no contemporary re-working of an ancient classic . this , folks , is film-making that aims for nothing more profound than the funny bone . this , folks , in all its glory , is frivolous comedy . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	screenplay : robert towne , from a story by ronald d . moore and brannon braga . director : john woo . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , adult themes ) running time : 125 minutes . if i didn't know any better , i'd swear tom cruise was trying to steal a franchise out from under pierce brosnan . take a look at mission : impossible 2 for a moment , and see if the elements don't sound familiar : a government agent on a dangerous mission . a villain with a dastardly plot . a beautiful romantic interest . stunts , action sequences and high-tech gadgetry a-plenty . add a phenomenally talented action director like john woo to the mix , and maybe its time to ask q for a little cruise control on the old aston-martin . right ? not at all , as it turns out . john woo's last film was 1997's face/off , the latest in a long line of films ( a better tomorrow , the killer ) that showed the director's gift for mixing outrageous action sequences with strong character content . don't expect any such complexities from mission : impossible 2 . robert towne's script tries to provide an anchor in hunt's relationship with nyah , but it materializes so instantaneously that it's impossible to give it any weight or consequence . dougray scott , meanwhile , is an effectively nasty villain , but i'll be damned if i could figure out the history between him and hunt that's supposed to give their tete-a-tete more sock . anthony hopkins turns up for a couple of uncredited scenes as hunt's vaguely menacing new superior , then disappears without any further acknowledgement of his vague menace . every time woo slows things down for a moment of dramatic significance , it's just a longer time to dwell on the fact that there really isn't any dramatic signficance . mission : impossible 2 still could have been a great ride with plenty of that trademark woo action , and it gets off to a rousing start with a sequence showcasing hunt doing a little recreational rock-climing . once it does get going again , it doesn't really stop until the closing credits -- there are whiz-bang car chases , two-guns-a-blazing john woo shooting matches , slow-mo slugfests and bombs going off like the whole movie was timed to the end of the " 1812 overture . " it's great stuff , even if some of the devices are a bit too familiar from woo's other films , but by the time it finally rolls around it's almost too late . an action film with this much exposition better make the exposition worth our while , or the audience will just end up wondering why it was wasting valuable action time . the original 1996 mission : impossible was nobody's idea of classic cinema , but it did have that undeniably nerve-wracking computer room break-in sequence to go with its high-energy finale . mission : impossible 2 nods to that highlight in yet another break-in sequence , along with a nice gag about hunt's preferred operational style . i had hoped for more than homage to a mediocre blockbuster from john woo -- something with its own show-stopping set pieces and a compelling story to boot . but ultimately , there's no financial point to cooking up brilliant storytelling for a franchise , because people will come no matter what the film is " about . " that's why brosnan , mgm and the estate of ian fleming can rest easy that there will always be a market for their films , the tom cruises of the world be hanged . there's enough furiously paced woo action in the final forty minutes to keep mission : impossible 2 from crashing and burning ; there's just not enough to make it anything special , nor enough depth to the story to fill in the blanks between chases . anyone who's followed woo's career knows he's better than this material , but maybe there's only so much even a gifted film-maker can do with a product that's first and foremost about a brand name . the name on the director's chair can only get in the way . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	bruce robinson , the creative director and writer of " withnail and i , " has come up once again with an original film , which again stars richard e . grant . " how to get ahead in advertising " is a tirade against the phony world of advertising and the screams denouncing that industry seemed like sweet music to my ears up to a point , as the message of the film eventually moved from being funny to becoming shrill and overwhelming , even to someone like me who was sympathetic to the script . ad men could very well be the lowest souls on the food chain on planet earth , is a point that doesn't have to be nailed into me before i get it . the point being made , is that both the business world and the world of science are ready to sell almost any product to make a buck , as they both exist by giving the public what they want . this is a film that rants on throughout , as it starts off very funny and then moves into sermonizing about the corrupt industry . the huckster's motto being : if you want to sell pimple cream , you have to encourage people to have pimples . the cast play their parts with the earnest intensity and gullibility required , with richard grant showing a lot of energy and a tremendous ability to verbalize . it's an unusual picture , one worth a look at for those who don't mind pure nuttiness instead of dramatics and tension in a story . it sounds far-reaching , a ghastly cry against the excesses of materialism , or does it ? 
2	starring : robert duvall , richard harris , sandra bullock , piper laurie , shirley maclaine . screenplay : steve conrad . director : randa haines . hollywood films focusing on the elderly have generally fallen into two broad categories : comedies making them lovable codgers whose most mundane physical activity is turned into slapstick , and melodramas about loneliness and facing death . we've already had one from column a this winter--grumpy old men--which makes it somewhat surprising to see wrestling ernest hemingway so soon , even though it falls under column b ; studios are notoriously fastidious in avoiding conflict with target demographics . wrestling ernest hemingway is melodramatic , and its pacing is rather slow , but it is also filled with fine acting and quirky but believable relationships , and ultimately proves quite satisfying . the only time that hemingway really missteps is in its forced plot . director randa haines ( children of a lesser god ) plays up scenes like a shared skinny-dip and a certain male bonding ritual on the 4th of july , which come off as more than a little silly , and the score by michael convertino is enough to make one's teeth ache . it is to his credit that when he lets his characters talk to each other , things get much more interesting . yet this central relationship is only one of several which truly shine . she demonstrates a genuine affection for him , one which never comes off as patronizing ; their connection is sweet and very affirming . from top to bottom , the cast creates a rich and real collection of characters whose interplay is exceptionally touching . it would be unfair to complete a review of wrestling ernest hemingway without giving the two central performances their due . harris , as usual , is bigger than life , but the role of frank calls for such a reading , and it is testemony to his craft that frank never seems pathetic . a lesser actor would have turned in a much more mannered performance , overdoing walter's habit of inspecting his beloved bacon sandwiches before eating them . their screenwriter and director force them to jump through some unnecessary hoops , but when they're left to do their own thing , wrestling ernest hemingway becomes an appealing drama about the need for contact . 
2	for the most part , despite an impressive track record with animated films , disney hasn't awed anyone with its recent live-action releases . poorly-scripted , weakly-acted , and unaplogetically politically correct , these features have been more like cookie-cutter cinematic candy than anything worth consuming . thankfully , the jungle book represents something of an entirely different breed . beautifully photographed and tightly paced with a spate of solid performances , this latest kipling-inspired motion picture is an enjoyable and exuberant film-going experience . where disney's animated jungle book was a light-hearted affair , this rendition is more of a straightforward adventure . that's not to imply that it's in any way stodgy or somber ; comic relief is provided by an orangutan called king louie and a human named john cleese . those familiar with the animated feature will recognize some non- human characters , including king louie , baloo the bear , bagheera the panther , and , of course , shere khan , the tiger king . this performance , while not of award-winning caliber , is characterized by a number of nice little " man/beast " touches . the most remarkable thing about the jungle book is juan ruiz- anchia's photography . with its striking shots of lush forests , cascading waterfalls , and catacomb-like treasure chambers , the movie is a visual feast . nevertheless , the jungle book rarely pauses to savor the scenery , moving instead with a pace that disallows opportunities for boredom . there are moments when the jungle book may be too intense for small children . animal maulings , while shown obliquely , occur on screen . those old enough not to be disturbed by such things should enjoy this movie , regardless of whether they consider themselves adults , kids , or something in-between . disney isn't just courting the younger audience with this film , either . jason scott lee's wardrobe , frequently limited to a loincloth , is designed to display his tanned , well-muscled body . the jungle book doesn't offer any thought-provoking philosophical messages , and its view of good and evil is simplistic ( characters clearly fall into one category or the other ) , but that lack of complexity is part of its charm . this film proves that the company behind the lion king can create worthwhile entertainment regardless of whether the animals are real or illustrated . the above represents the opinions of the author , and not necessarily those of bellcore or any organization within bellcore . 
0	john frankenheimer was once recognized as a quality filmmaker capable of making great paranoid thrillers ( the manchurian candidate ) , who has slipped off the precipice of reliability and is now reduced to making this nonsensical , exploitive actioner , that has a bleak metallic snowy look to it . it is made as if to bypass movie houses and go straight to video rentals . it is made from a mindless script . no director , cinematographer , or actor could have made this into a credible film ( well ! replacing affleck as the lead couldn't have hurt in immediately improving it . the film's only purpose seems to be to come up with as many ludicrous plot twists as possible and see if any one in the audience can guess how it will work itself out . the violence is gratuitous and in the last 20 minutes or so , the story proves itself to be an insulting one . the characters became gradually less and less human as the twists kept piling up . the shame of this film , is that it was oddly enough entertaining for long stretches , as it seemed to pass for being a diverting actioner , until it reached the point of no return in tolerability . to say that this film had holes in the script and that everything about the story could be challenged , goes without saying . but things only get more contrived the further along the story moves , so better to forget all the contrivances to the story and try to enjoy the film as is , and take this b- film for what it is . this little ploy will go on for the remainder of the film , as rudy is sometimes nick and sometimes he's just plain rudy . if you think you have seen the main twists , let me warn you , that's just the beginning of all the surprises . the more of them there are , the less sense the film seems to make . john frankenheimer moves the action along at breakneck speed but the more the characters try explaining the ever-changing situations , the more ridiculous the explanations become . then the film tries to pull a complete 360 degree reversal and end on a note of christmas cheer , since i think this is supposed to be some kind of christmas story . what disturbed me more than anything else about the film , which includes its senseless violence and its need for an obligatory nude shot of theron , was the audacity to try and clean up the mess it made , by relating the film's finale to the holiday spirit of giving . it seems to want to spread its desperate gloom over everything it can touch . the thing this film mostly gave me , was a sense of astonishment that frankenheimer , who could still in flashes shoot a scene that is mesmerizing ( the one on the cracked ice with affleck jumping into the chilly water to save theron ) and then follow it up with one that is so dopey ( machine-gunning warfare in a casino that looks like a supermarket ) , that you wonder what happened to the director in a career that spanned 44- years . what compelled him to make such a dumb film as this one !

1	wim wenders' the end of violence offers the same type of experience one could expect from sitting through a david lynch film with a reasonably-coherent narrative ( unlike , for example , lost highway ) . arguably wenders' most disjointed film to date , the end of violence is a neo-noir thriller that's really more about social decay and human isolation than it is about government conspiracies , mysterious murders , and missing persons . unfortunately , it's also too long and too slow , and , by the time the end credits have started rolling , it has lost most of its energy . wenders' narrative style is not only a little too languid , but it's often irritating in the erratic manner that it skips back and forth between divergent storylines . the problem is that wenders has three groups of characters to divide time between , and he often switches from one to another just when things are getting interesting . this is certainly not happening by accident . it's as if wenders wanted to make the transitions as jarring and frustrating as possible . ultimately , this results in a motion picture that , despite having intriguing aspects , is never fully satisfying . he's never without at least one lap-top and two cellular phones . for him , communication is a means of transferring necessary information -- nothing more . there is certainly no emotion involved . many of their scenes are obviously intended as homages to the great noir thrillers of the '40s and '50s , with both cat and " doc " dressed and acting the parts of the stars of that era . anyone expecting a straightforward thriller is in for a very big disappointment . wenders and screenwriter nicholas klein aren't interested in answering many of the questions posed by the narrative -- in fact , they only hint at possible solutions to several of the biggest issues . and the ending , such as it is , leaves a lot of room for interpretation . on the other hand , if you approach this film as a study of the mutability of human nature , the need for redemption , the growing lack of meaningful human interaction in the electronic era , and the lure of violence , it has the power to involve , if not overwhelm . ultimately , the noir thriller is just the means that wenders uses to explore these issues . if only he had managed to inject a little more life into the proceedings . . . the acting in the end of violence seems either strangely muted or outrageously over-the-top . aside from traci lind and loren dean , who are pleasantly enjoyable as they imitate past performances rather than create something original , there isn't a single portrayal in this film that attracted my attention . the film's title is richly ironic because this movie is about the proliferation of violence , not its end . wenders has packed a lot of issues into the end of violence , and i challenge anyone to call the script " dumb . " sadly , however , unlike the director's best work ( the wings of desire ) , it's neither involving nor magical . the end of violence offers viewers opportunities to ponder a variety of diverse subjects , but its overall entertainment value is less than one might hope for . great ideas and eye-catching cinematography only add up to a wonderful movie when they're contained in a powerful narrative . and that's the one key ingredient where the end of violence falls short .

1	cast : john turturro , massimo ghini , stefano dionisi , rade serbedzija , agnieszka wagner director : francesco rosi producers : guido de laurentiis , leo pescarolo screenplay : tonino guerra , sandro petraglia , stefano ruli , and francesco rosi based on the autobiography by primo levi cinematography : pasqualino de santis , marco pontecorvo music : luis enriquez bacalov u . s . distributor : miramax films the truth , as depicted in francesco rosi's the truce , was far more complex . however , while rosi's film deserves recognition for highlighting a forgotten aspect of the jewish post-holocaust experience , there are serious flaws in his approach . a far more powerful and better balanced depiction of this subject can be found in the 1997 non-fiction effort , the long way home , which captured the best documentary oscar . the long way home shows the horror and disgust with which the rescuers viewed the holocaust victims . this almost- worshipful attitude occasionally makes the truce seem more like a piece of pro-soviet propaganda than a legitimate dramatic exploration of what happened when the jews were set free . the film opens with the liberation of auschwitz in early 1945 . while the truce tells a story that is occasionally compelling and disturbing , the film feels like it has been sanitized . in trying to inject some lighthearted humor into a tale that is inherently deeply tragic , director francesco rosi reduces the truce to a series of loosely-connected , semi-comic episodes . inexplicably , supporting characters keep turning up at different points on primo's journey to offer support and encouragement . on the whole , primo's journey seems more like a trek through a land of adventure rather than a shuffle down the road of despair . whenever the truce works , it does so largely due to the moving , introverted performance of john turturro . other than turturro , however , no one in the cast leaves much of an impression . massimo ghini is okay as primo's glib friend , but serbedzija comes across as an over-the-top clown and wagner is never given an opportunity to develop her character into anything more substantial than a token prostitute with a good heart . the truce is not an innately bad film , but rosi makes some ill- advised choices in the way he chooses to present the story . those who have not seen the long way home will probably react more positively to this effort than those who have . when viewed in the light of the documentary , the truce does not fare well . not only is the tone off , but the narrative seems shallow and erratic . turturro's performance partly redeems the proceedings , but even he cannot elevate the truce to the high level at which this material deserves to be presented .

" it " . . . caught in one's zipper . if that kind of subject matter seems more likely to have you grimacing than guffawing , don't say i didn't warn you : there's even more where that came from . viewers with less delicate sensibilities , on the other hand , may be hoarse at the end of a relentlessly raucous two hours . it's unfair to spoil the moments with specifics ; half the fun in there's something about mary comes from i-can't-believe-they-did-that reactions . suffice to say that nearly everything works , from the surrealist use of alt-rock icon jonathan richman as the film's narrator/troubadour to the subverted romantic montage , from the perfectly-pitched charm of diaz ( rapidly becoming the most appealing screen actress of her generation , if she's not there already ) to the goofy appeal of stiller . there's something about mary recalls blazing saddles-era mel brooks , or airplane ! -era zucker-abrahams-zucker -- back-brain humor which will be as dumb and/or offensive to some viewers as it is hilarious to others . brilliant , it ain't ; brilliantly executed , it is . there are a couple of slow patches in there's something about mary , which probably runs longer than advisable at nearly two hours . when it pauses long enough to pretend that the character relationships matter , or to explain a rather unnecessary plot twist , the film could have you shifting in your seat . fortunately , they're only momentary distractions between laughs that beat down your logical objections , building and building until they add up to more laughs than you can remember at the movies . i'm not proud of the fact that i'd rather sit through there's something about mary again than any one of the inspid romantic comedies of the past five years that generally passed for comic entertainment , but i would . i'll worry about what that means tomorrow . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
1	thus we set the stage for octopussy - you gotta love those bond names -- 1983's episode of the james bond saga , and roger moore's penultimate appearance as the famous secret agent . louis jourdan , as kamal khan , is one of the most debonair and suave of all of bond's villains , who traditionally are crude ones like spectre's #1 or goldfinger . khan has the looks and demeanor that come closest to rivaling bond's own . the smooth talking khan , wearing clothes that look like retro mao , never breaks a sweat . and in a scene designed solely to shock , we find that the superrich view sheep's eyes as a special delicacy . in order to make the ever-gray east germany interesting , the picture is visually enlivened by setting it in a circus , bursting with characters in colorful costumes . this along with director john glen's deliberately slower pacing gives the strangely serene film the feel more of a romance than an action thriller . octopussy's purpose is more to provide a romantic element than to provide an another villain . the endings of bond pictures are traditionally full of theatrics . the overblown conclusion of octopussy includes a sequence of james ridding high above the battle on a hot air balloon made of bright british flag material . octopussy runs too long at 2 : 05 . it is rated pg for comic violence and sexual innuendo and would be fine for kids around 9 and up . my son jeffrey , almost 9 , thought it was an okay movie but complained that there weren't any real bad guys in it and that he didn't understand what all of that egg thing was about . overall he felt the show just didn't make enough sense for him . 
2	habit , supposedly a vampire movie , but , perhaps , it is more like a psychological thriller/love story . he looks out of it as he stumbles along , and as he looks around in disbelief , he sees the other celebrants in their costumes , and just goes stumbling on , not quite so sure if the scary creatures he is seeing are for real or induced from his inebriated state . you feel sam's agony of living in such a crowded city as n . y . , constantly hearing its pulsating city rhythms , experiencing its dark fears , and you are always aware of the noise and many distractions there are , especially when you need space to think . but one thing is certain , something bad is happening to him . what makes this vampire type of film different than the others , is that it is very personal , more about the psychological state of a guy who doesn't seem to be a psychotic , but is very confused about the new direction his life is taking him . most of the other films of this kind seem so unreal in regards to any kind of personal underpinnings that are frightening to them , that the fright in them appears to be from watching good filmmaking , not from something that can possibly crop up in their daily lives or invade their inner being . fessender has fully thought out the details of how a person can break down in front of us and not have any recourse in putting a stop to it , making the story as plausible and far-reaching as possible . there are a lot of things that happened involving relationships and inner perceptions , that you need time and peace of mind to think about , just as sam needed , that might never make sense . but that isn't the point . . . it is usually the things that don't make sense , that bother us the most . the film has a captivating style and playful mood to it , that keeps you involved in the intelligently told story , which is rare for this genre . 
1	what saves the lesson from being a reduntant one , is the superb performance of the ensemble cast , all acting in harmony with one another . grant feels like he is just marking time by teaching in such a barren place , that all the kids will just become ditch-diggers anyway , so it is a waste of time teaching them to read . this film adapted from the novel by ernest j . gaines has the mark of truth and morality on its side . it evoked a sense of what rural louisiana was like back in the 1940s for african-americans , and it set the mood for what was to come about in the 1950s and 1960s , as segregation couldn't be justified anymore by a democratic country . what the film lacked was a tension in the story , everything seemed too dry and predictable , except for the theme , which was right on the money . 
1	touch is a film about healing through stigmata . for those of you like myself who recognize the word but have no idea what it means , the movie's information kit defines it as " a spontaneous manifestation of bloody wounds on a person's hands , feet , and side , similar to wounds of the crucified jesus christ . " with this much information you probably figure touch is another movie from some religious order . schrader is a director who likes his material on the edge . as you can now guess , schrader approaches touch in ways that other directors might not . although touch does have its moments , i spent most of the movie as confused as the actors . as occasional nervous laughter crept into what was otherwise an unusually silent press screening , i kept asking myself : was this line supposed to be funny ? are we laughing with the show or at it ? most of the actors were confused as to whether they were in a serious film or a comedy . others seemed to feel they were in a parody . many scenes were quite enjoyable , and yet . . . perhaps it was the movie's beginning that turned me off . any show that starts with someone throwing objects at a television screen because he does not like what is playing puts my cliche meter immediately into the red zone . skeet ulrich's acting makes the picture . you are never sure what he is going to do next , and he has the innocence of a true faith healer . his goatee and overall appearance are meant to remind the audience of jesus without trying to copy some religious picture exactly . walken and fonda are great actors and watching them pull off these ambiguous roles was one of the delights of the film . and juvenal can confess to her , " i bleed from five wounds and heal people , but i've never been in love . " touch bogs now more than you would expect from a paul schrader film . in one long scene , for example , walken and fonda are forced to sit around making small talk . walken is better doing something creepy , and fonda seems too intelligent to bother with this meaningless banter . easily the weakest character in the film , tom arnold gets large amounts of screen time as august murray , the head of a protest movement within the roman catholic church . arnold's performance borders on the embarrassing . the movie is full of known actors . a director and an actor , mazursky has had mixed success with both careers . here he is the most wasted of all of the actors . davidovitch acts with great gusto in what is a part so small that it would have vanished without her energy . garofalo takes her few lines and makes them special by her mere presence . " controversy is my oxygen , " lusanna says . " it's the air i breathe . " gershon's acting abilities appear limited to large smiles . an off-beat show , certainly . and sometimes , an interesting one . but too much of its far out humor just doesn't work . touch runs just 1 : 37 . it is rated r . there is some male and female nudity , a little sex , a little violence , and a few cuss words . perhaps it was the sacrilegious aspects that got it the r , but i would have expected the film to have gotten a pg-13 . the show would be fine for any teenager and perhaps those just a bit younger if they can understand the humor in the material . i liked parts of the show especially some of the acting , but cannot bring myself to recommend it . i give it * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

2	i worried when six degrees of separation started because for a few brief moments i thought i had walked into a neal simon comedy , which i hate . the words per minute rate for the first part of the show is exceeded only by swimming to cambodia and maybe by my dinner with andre . the script by john guare deserves an award - witty and very bright . you don't want to cough and miss a word of it . the movie is based on a play which i believe has the same name . there are many memorable lines . my favorite has to do with what to give rich people and how simple it is . see the movie to find out . you never know when you may want to send bill gates a little something . best to be ready at a moment's notice . there are three award quality performances . the movie is a comedy in a way , but even more it is an evolving mystery . most of all , however , it is a character study and some fascinating characters they are . i am not giving any of the plot away - much better to be surprised . the direction by fred schepisi of the ensemble cast has them all in perfect rhythm . six degrees of separation was bursting with energy . the editing keep a good pacing and the show ran 1 : 51 . it is rated r for reasons which escape me . i think it would be fine for teenagers to see by themselves . it gets * * * 1/2 in my book and a strong recommendation to go see it . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : march 2 , 1994 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	and phil is just one of the many quirky characters that inhabit shopping for fangs . made on a pittance , the film features an almost exclusively asian-american cast . as directed by quentin lee and justin lin , the movie is so amateurishly bad that it could almost be a parody of indie films . the picture is filled with stereotypes . from its opening scene of an attempted rape at knifepoint to its easy to guess ending twist , the script rarely has anything to offer . the story is so minimally developed that it feels almost like the actors were ad-libbing . one can only hope that the directors' next film will have some substance and some credible acting . it is rated r for sex , violence , and profanity and would be fine for older teenagers . 
1	screenplay : james mangold . director : james mangold . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , brief nudity ) running time : 103 minutes . at the age of 50 , sylvester stallone made a bold career move . after spending more than a decade making mega-millions for carrying flimsy films on his broad shoulders , stallone realized that he wasn't getting any younger . at the age of 50 , sylvester stallone decided to take up acting . in one sense , it was a brilliant decision . freddy heflin is easily stallone's best role since the one stallone wrote for himself 20 years ago -- one rocky balboa -- and stallone does some wonderful work with it . with minimal theatrics , stallone shows us a man who never wanted anything more than to be a cop finally deciding to be one of the good guys . with such solid potential in that story -- and such a talented cast of co-stars -- i'm sure the last thing stallone expected was that he would have to carry cop land the same way he carried his formula action films . yet that is exactly what he has to do , because mangold has written only one real character in cop land , and provided only one real conflict . even deniro gets little to work with and does even less with it , playing the short-fused i . a . man like every short-fused movie cop cliche rolled into one . only ray liotta , as a coke-addicted cop trying to go straight , offers any genuine support to stallone . every event not directly related to freddy feels trite and perfunctory ; every scene is given the most obvious spin . actors make choices like the one stallone made with cop land because they believe that the film is going to get noticed , that it could do for them what pulp fiction did for john travolta and bruce willis . he just found one great character . it's the kind of character people revise their career plans for , the kind of role which can make a movie star want to be an actor . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
2	for anyone who is familiar with the movies of the late john cassavetes , one of america's most fiercely independent film makers of the '60s and '70s , there will be no doubt that the screenplay for she's so lovely came from his pen . and , since rowlands appears in she's so lovely , this is , in a sense , a family production . nick is more of a polished , traditional film maker . what might she's so lovely have been like had john cassavetes directed it ? while it's impossible to know for sure , we need look no farther than cassavetes' most celebrated film , a woman under the influence , for some clues . so , while i'm not trying to suggest that the films are identical in any significant way , the similarities are striking enough to offer an idea of the kinds of themes that were important to john cassavetes . in 1996 , there was a film called mad love , starring chris o'donnell and drew barrymore . that title would have been very appropriate for she's so lovely , a darkly comic drama about the debilitating effects of drinking from a cocktail made of love and insanity . many of the film's themes are not fully realized , but , even in this form , it's difficult to deny the impact of she's so lovely , especially since it questions where our responsibility to ourselves ends and where our responsibility to our family begins . both eddie and maureen exhibit streaks of violent , self-destructive behavior . this creates an interesting dynamic -- since we , the audience , don't have a rooting interest , we are able to watch the characters' actions from a somewhat detached perspective . while there are times that the script shows seams , the powerhouse performances of penn and wright penn allow us to overlook many of these . in a way , she's so lovely functions more as an outline of a story than the actual story , but the two lead characters are presented so vividly , and their interaction is so intense , that it doesn't seem to matter much . if there's a weakness in character development , it's that joey is a pretty one-dimensional lout , and travolta plays him much like vincent vega from pulp fiction . she's so lovely is uncomfortable because it challenges our perceptions about love and family . maureen and joey have the american dream , but does it really mean anything ? some viewers will undoubtedly be dismayed by the film's abrupt ending ( which isn't really an ending at all ) , but , by the time the end credits roll , we know all that we need to know to guess how things will probably turn out . she's so lovely isn't a flawless production , but it's a fitting tribute to john cassavetes , and a reminder of the many ways that a woman can be under the influence .

2	poetry is the vehicle of choice for how the story is best transcribed onscreen , since dialogue is almost non-existent . it is told as if time doesn't exist , one event runs into another and everything seems jumbled . images of water and fire are used throughout the film for purposes of symbolically cleansing the soul and destroying the impurities in it . paint is used as a contrast to blood . in a film loaded with contrasts , the huge gap between most of the population which is poor , is harshly contrasted with those who have money to burn . innocence is being corrupted by the experienced , proving that nothing remains pure in this city that steals one's life , one's poetry , and one's spirit . which signifies that there is something despairing about the foreign influence in vietnam , but what that despair exactly means , is never clearly stated in the context of the story . he somehow keeps her a virgin by having her do all the kinky sex tricks that do not involve touching , like peeing for a customer . this film is a visual masterpiece , capturing the frenetic pace of life in the city and the faces of sorrow on the poor ; it paints an unsentimental picture of a place that is a living hell . but it is not a masterpiece storywise , as its storyline was rambling , laying no specific blame for what is happening on the local government or for that matter , on anyone , only implying how rotten the western influence is . also , it seemed to me , there were too many violent scenes , as the filmmaker seems to revel in them without expounding on them . this powerful film offers westerners a potent dosage of what life is like in a third world country , a country most americans only envision in a depersonalized way , but the film still had too many gaps in its storytelling and too many loose ends it left not fully developed . cyclo , as a person , should have been more flesh-and-blood like , rather than used as merely a morbid symbolic example of the loss of innocence . there was something there that just seemed to be elusive about the film , the director just wouldn't let the viewer get into without imposing his own personal barriers ; he doesn't even want to give us their real names , as if he thought , we would sully their hardships even more than it already is . he mainly wants to shock our sensibilities , to have us look plaintively at his native country like he does , even if he too is only a tourist . there is nothing wrong with that in itself , but his social designs could have been painted with clearer brush strokes . the contrast between those who are gentle and those who are brutal , and those who are dreamers and those who can't dream anymore , could have been better utilized than to point out the obvious , of how wretched a place this is and of how the gentle ( innocent ) have little chance of succeeding . still , this is one powerful film , filled with relentless and disturbing visualizations , whose poetic voice comes from the inside of the director and is strong and boiling over with metaphorical emotion . cyclo was a deserved winner of a golden lion award for best film at the venice film festival . 
1	this is a coming-of-age film , that plays as bittersweet melodramatics . it's a pleasant little film , with its small aims hitting its target repeatedly , quietly reflecting the joys and sorrows the youngster must go through in order to grow up , and how the bland 1950s and its omens of the future in space travel , new pop-up toasters , and a tv in every house , influence the youngster's life . by being very easy to talk to , with no pretenses , he thereby develops a warm and natural relationship with the youngster and makes his summer experience a joyous one . the film is charming , it is sad , it is true-to-life , and never maudlin or sugary . it's a good nostalgia film for all those yearning to look back at their childhood , even if it be only vicariously through ingemar . i fell for the film without being swept off my feet by it . the message underlying ingemar's experience , is that life holds so much suffering in it , that one might as well get a few laughs out of it while one can . the scenes of the snow on the tv screen while all the neighbors are brought in to watch a movie , the radio broadcast of the swedish boxer ingemar johansson landing a lucky punch and knocking out the american champ floyd patterson , and the challenging games kids play to compete against each other , all brought back to me bittersweet memories of the 1950s . 
0	lamerica is a bleak picture about modern day albania , which is an oxymoron . the albania shown in this film , which i have no reason to believe is inaccurate , is a dreary place of abject poverty - sort of the antithesis of a vacation haven . shows about measurable conditions can be interesting and rewarding . lamerica's purpose , on the other hand , seems to be to shock us with the poverty while weaving an opaque tale . the show has a plethora of scenes of the staring masses either charging for food donations like animals of sitting around staring at the strange foreigners with morbid fascination . the old age homes are dark and worse than most concentration camp pictures i have seen . the people all have a quarter of an inch of caked on dirt , they walk like zombies from a low budget horror picture , and many have missing limbs . the script by gianni amelio , andrea porporati , and alessandro sermoneta is overly earnest and not very memorable , but it does have one good line i remember . no water today . maybe tomorrow . " i was not impressed with any of the acting , but carmelo di mazzarelli's performance was the most obscure and least effective of the bunch . lamerica runs way too long at 1 : 55 . it is in italian and some albanian , all with english subtitles . the film is not rated . given some of the strong images and the adult themes , it would probably get an r , but perhaps it could qualify for a pg-13 . it would be fine for any teenager . this is the sort of art house film with which many critics and art house patrons resonate . to me , however , it is nothing more than a chronology of poverty without a compelling script . i know the writers and director wanted me to feel sorry for the albanians . i do . more than that , i see little purpose in the film . you can overpraise a bad artistic film and no one will care , but dislike an earnest one like this , and people are up in arms over the critic's " stupidity . " i once gave a mediocre review to burnt by the sun , and i think half the russians in the world wrote me unflattering letters . finally , i give the film * 1/2 for its seriousness . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : may 13 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	screenplay : sara bernstein and gregory bernstein . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 98 minutes . on its face , director jonathan lynn's decision to make trial and error looks like a very , very bad one . sure , he had an unexpected success with a previous film about an inexperienced attorney fumbling around in a backwater courtroom ( my cousin vinny ) , but that was exactly the reason not to try it again . the subject matter is flimsy enough without trying to make it work _twice_ ; such hubris usually guarantees the wrath of the cinematic fates . yet trial and error somehow turns out to be another lightweight-but-agreeable comedy in the tradition of my cousin vinny , with just enough smiles and giggles to prove satisfying . it's hard to get terribly worked up over either the positive or negative qualities of trial and error . the comic situations offer consistent chuckles , as well as a fair number of missed opportunities . the casting presents appealing and talented performers like richards , daniels , torn and charlize theron ( sparkling with energy as a waitress who steals charlie's heart ) then gives them little to do . time and again trial and error will deliver a really satisfying moment , only to follow it up with an underwhelming one . it's actually to lynn's credit , however , that trial and error never seems like it's straining for every possible laugh . that's what you might have expected if the film had been set up as a star vehicle for richards ; the idea of liar liar with richards in the lead is primally disturbing . richards's role isn't far removed from " seinfeld's " kramer , providing the expected physical comedy and goofy reaction takes . as he contorts his body to simulate getting a kick to the ribs , you wonder whether richards can defy gravity to suit his comic purposes . yet daniels is never treated strictly as a second banana ; in fact , his romantic sub-plot may be the real heart of the film . the two gifted supporting actors do something fairly rare in screen buddy comedies : they actually support each other , rather than trying to step on each other . despite the effective pairing of richards and daniels , trial and error doesn't generate as many laughs as it should , particularly in the courtroom . richards' legend-in-his-own mind actor is a howl when he tries to translate the confrontational hyperbolics of fictional courtrooms to the real world , but that doesn't happen often enough . only at isolated moments , like during torn's sob-story testimony , does the script really seem to be providing a-level material . trial and error isn't a truly memorable comedy , but it's a well-paced and frequently amusing one . 
1	mpaa rating : unrated ( could be pg-13 for brief nudity , profanity ) running time : 89 minutes . that , unfortunately , is what prevents barenaked in america from being a particularly interesting film experience . the ladies are presented by priestley as a group of nice , intelligent guys having loads of fun entertaining their fans , almost completely unfazed by their sudden notoriety in america . great stuff for a people magazine profile ; not so much for a feature documentary . chalk it up to bad luck , perhaps , but the time frame for priestley's profile is all wrong . start the story a few months earlier , and you may have something : a hard-working bunch of decent guys swooping back and forth between the highest highs and the lowest lows . as it actually unfolds , barenaked in america is utterly bereft of drama . which is not to say that it's utterly bereft of entertainment . even viewers who are not bnl devotees will find it hard to deny the energetic appeal of their stage shows , which turn into rowdy audience-participation improvisations . unfortunately , barenaked in america isn't a straight-ahead concert film . it's not really clear exactly what priestley wants it to be , in fact . there are token bits of archival footage , but not enough to provide a sense of where the ladies came from . there are moments of backstage and person-on-the-street cavorting , but not enough to make the film a showcase for the band members' off-stage charm . and there are token glimpses of the easy-going fellows putting their feet down on business decisions ( like their dissatisfaction with a video for their follow-up single " it's all been done " ) , but they feel completely incongruous with most of the film pitched lighter than air . occasionally priestley takes an off-beat angle , like letting both fans and detractors of the band speak their minds after hearing bnl music . far more often , he simply turns on his camera like a buddy of the band making a home movie . these guys were never going to yield a spinal tap-like story of internal meltdown and rampant ego ; it would have taken a much more skilled documentarian and a much more precise time frame to make a barenaked ladies film soar . the band itself deserves the attention , because talented pop musicians and songwriters with a zeal for showmanship are in too short supply to dismiss them as a novelty act . if anything positive comes from barenaked in america , it might be encouraging more people to know the band from its live shows . that's the barenaked experience that should be recorded for posterity . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
2	director : michael mann . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 155 minutes . in another place and time , he would have crafted operas -- grand-scale tales of human conflict blown up several times larger than life , accompanied by choruses and crescendos . neither the subject matter nor the genre alters mann's sense of the theatrical . the gothic horror of the keep , the cop/crook conflict of heat , the historical drama of the last of the mohicans -- all were treated as very important films , sometimes through sprawling running times , sometimes through lingering slow-motion images . mann's brand of operatic cinema has never quite been my cup of tea , and i was even more skeptical when i knew he had gotten his hands on material like the insider . this was , after all , a story about undeniably important issues : the insidious influence of corporate consolidation ; journalistic ethics ; the weighty responsibility of challenging the powers that be . could mann resist creating a film that would collapse under the weight of its self-imposed significance ? he could , and he did , though the insider is a much better personal story than it is a sweeping indictment of journalism-as-big-business . ironically , that pig-headed side of wigand is shown to be the reason he persists even when brown & williamson starts playing the hardest hardball . it's also the side that makes the insider most compelling -- and most unnerving -- as b&w begins digging up every possible speck of dirt from wigand's past to discredit him . it's a notion only a half-step removed from the tragic state of our political process -- the discouraging idea no sane man would open his entire history , warts and all , to public scrutiny . as long as the insider sticks close to wigand's story and the ever-mounting repercussions for his actions , it's pretty strong stuff . paper chase storytelling is tough to pull off , and mann does a more than serviceable job of finding drama in ethical debate . it's just that once again he's in opera man mode , giving pacino a stage for railing with righteous indignation ( a scenario that never does pacino any favors ) . the subject is interesting , but it is not about the deathknell of the free press . at more than two and a half hours , the insider starts to drag , and feels particularly out-of-control when mann drags in the unabomber story near the conclusion . mann does know how to make a moment of truth crackle ; he knows how to create compelling human stories . he doesn't always know when enough is enough -- when that next shot of someone walking in super slow-mo will feel overly pretentious , or when that wailing chorus will begin to grate on the nerves . eventually , even after plenty of solid filmmaking , you're just ready for that fat lady to hurry up and sing already . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	cast : michael keaton , andy garcia , brian cox , marcia gay hardin , erik king , joseph cross director : barbet schroeder producers : barbet schroeder & susan hoffman and gary foster & lee rich screenplay : david klass cinematography : luciano tovoli music : trevor jones u . s . distributor : tristar pictures when i picture michael keaton , the image that comes to mind is one of an affable , ordinary guy with a comic edge -- the kind of person who has made his mark in films like mr . yet , in desperate measures , a preposterous thriller from director barbet schroeder ( single white female ) , that's exactly what keaton is -- a ruthless , amoral killer whose steely eyes and cold-blooded humor inspire equal parts revulsion and wariness . in fact , it wouldn't be too far from the truth to say that the actor's work is the only worthwhile element of the film . alas , when the viewer looks beyond keaton's performance , it's pretty much a wasteland . the story , which begins with a modicum of promise , quickly devolves into a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow action setups . ultimately , desperate measures is basically one long chase sequence , and its appeal is likely to be limited even for those who enjoy that sort of thing . to vary the film's tone and rhythm , the movie makers incorporate a number of classic thriller clich ? s , including one of the most overused of all -- the child in danger . however , the realization that children do not die in mainstream american movies drains away whatever little tension desperate measures tries to generate through this plot device . every movie demands a certain level of suspension of disbelief from an audience , but the bar for desperate measures is so high that the thinking movie-goer will never attain it . in many ways , this movie is more absurd than die hard , and it certainly isn't as tightly-scripted or well-produced ( nor is it intended to be as blatantly cartoonish ) . on top of that , the action isn't very original and the degree of tension is surprisingly low for a tale that features such high stakes . then again , as i indicated earlier , it's not hard to guess how the film is going to end . predictable thrillers are not the most energetic movies . the result is an engaging character instead of an irritating whiner or someone who tugs shamelessly at our heartstrings with cloying displays of cuteness . i've never particularly liked andy garcia in thrillers , and his flat work here serves only to confirm that opinion . garcia is at his best in dramas ; he seems out of his depth when physical acting takes precedence over dialogue . there's a twist at the end , but it's not much of a surprise , and , even without reflection , it understates just how stupid the plot is . desperate measures is one of a broad category of thrillers that insults its audience with its obvious idiocy . worse still , there's not enough good action to partially redeem the production . these features make desperate measures an exercise in futility , and , when you consider how many contrivances the characters have to endure to reach the ending , you may think that the title has more to do with the film makers' approach than with anything that happens on screen . - ingmar bergman 
2	the film paints a grim picture of his family , though it's certainly not the worst family to raise kids . this impressive debut film is visually very powerful , it has plenty of images to relate to what's burning inside james . this audacious film seems like a nightmare , or a dream that james can't wake up from . the result is a lyrical work that has a numbing affect because of its sparseness and tight images ; it's a film of high quality . 
0	director : jon turtletaub . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 124 minutes . there was a sense of deja-vu developing long before i actually saw instinct , inspired by the presentation of the basic premise in the trailers . couldn't help but think i'd seen this somewhere before . then i saw the film , and it all became clear . this wasn't just a case of hopkins flexing his hannibal lecter muscles again before taking on the film version of thomas harris' recently-published sequel to the silence of the lambs . he was simply keeping pace with a story that slaps together characters , situations and exact shots from dozens of other films . you could spend a productive day doing little more than ticking off the films from which instinct cribs : one flew over the cuckoo's nest , gorillas in the mist , tarzan , the shawshank redemption and even dead poets society in addition to the silence of the lambs . gerald dipego's script plods along , dropping its familiar cinematic tropes like bread crumbs leading the audience to its responses . there's even a scene of confounding idiocy in which we , the knee-jerking audience , are supposed to cheer for caulder irresponsibly whipping a room full of jailed psychotics into a rebellious frenzy . somehow , in the midst of so much uninspired tripe , anthony hopkins still manages to come through with a performance that's invigorating to watch . sure , it's a spin on hannibal lecter , but it's more fiercely intelligent than anything the rest of the film can deliver . you can't help but lean forward when you hear that seductive baritone ; you can't help but shudder when caulder's neck hinges on the correct answer to a very tricky question . hopkins makes instinct better . he also makes it worse , because everything else looks even more workmanlike , notably cuba gooding jr . 's performance . a little economy and subtlety -- skills hopkins demonstrates even when playing a wild man -- could have served gooding well . sadly , subtlety is one thing instinct has in very short supply . even viewers prepared to sympathize with the film's fuzzy embrace of the state of nature will find this more a philosophical tract ( albeit one with remarkably realistic animatronic apes by stan winston ) than a compelling drama . we all know man bad/animals good , which makes the decision to turn the humans into cartoonish villains even more perplexing . if there were a moment of real insight into a character , the rest of instinct's brainless cinematic thievery might have been more tolerable . instead , it lets breathing plot devices gab at one another for two hours between unnervingly familiar situations . thank heavens for the entertainment value of anthony hopkins' gloss on film's best-known cannibal . it's only fitting in a film that does plenty of cannibalizing of its own . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	what has happened to these people since , and what is the relevance of this photograph ? although this outline is standard issue , the circumstances surrounding it are not . the book " fatherland " is a taut thriller and author robert harris's first novel . i read this engrossing tale on vacation a few years back and thought at the time that a wonderful motion picture could be made from it . although the script by ron hutchinson and stanley weiser borrows liberally from the novel , usually reliable director christopher menaul ( " prime suspect 1 " and feast of july ) manages to excise much of the suspense . most of the key events from the novel are there , but in the 1994 film fatherland they are laid before the viewer devoid of much of the energy and emotion present in the novel . hitler has essentially won the war with a stalemated peace even if the us never signed a treaty , and the war on the eastern front with russia drags on ad infinitum . rutger hauer , who specializes of late in over-the-top performances , is remarkably subtle this time as major xavier march . rory jennings plays dili as an automaton who shows little emotion at times when any human being would have had to be significantly affected . in delicious bit of casting against type , jean marsh shows up briefly as a creepy old german actress who blames her lack of success in america on those jews who run the studios . the book spent more time on the detective work whereas the movie devotes too much time to establishing hauer's " good " nazi credentials . and while the book kept the reader on the edge of the chair , the movie's laconic pacing and unhurried staging robs the story of its threatening immediacy . the movie makes everything too predictable , but the book had the gift of making the obvious surprising . a gripping and lucid book is thus transformed into a confusing and slow movie that is populated with a remarkably tame group of nazis with little visible anger . even the gestapo , with the exception of their sinister hats , don't seem to be a particularly bad lot . still , the fascinating underlying plot and hauer's moving performance ultimately save the picture , but just barely . it is rated pg-13 for brief nudity , some violence and a few pictures of concentration camp victims . the film would be fine for kids age 12 and up . 
1	can infertility be funny ? i can think of a few scenarios that might cause laughter . unfortunately , none of these are present in keith samples' directorial debut , a smile like yours , which vacillates uncertainly between unfunny farce and ineffectual melodrama . the co- writer/director obviously wants this to be an uplifting , feel good experience , but , inexplicably , he injects so much pathos into the situation ( a couple who desperately want , but can't produce , a child ) that parts of a smile like yours are downers . i believe there's some kind of hidden rule that any film featuring infertility must have the obligatory " man going to fill the cup with semen " scene . film makers always seem to think this is hilarious ; it's too bad the audience has seen it so many times that it has long since lost whatever residual humor it once possessed . worse still , not only is this scene in the movie , but it's repeated time after time after time . alas , danny's sperm are weak swimmers , and they can't reach jennifer's eggs . then again , they were just supporting characters -- the main chemistry was left to harrison ford and julia ormand . here , kinnear and holly are back together again , and , unfortunately , the heat still isn't there . with the exception of a few calculated " cute " moments , these two comprise one of the least interesting couples of the year . holly's range is severely limited and kinnear , while gradually developing into a polished performer , still has trouble with the more serious moments . the supporting players are uniformly more interesting than the leads . jay thomas , who's always good for a laugh or two , is danny's best friend . joan cusack is a little less ditzy than usual as jennifer's perfume-selling business partner . a smile like yours tries to be funny , charming , and delightful . except on rare occasions , it is none of the three . from time-to-time , one of the film's farcical elements has satirical value ( like the low- budget flight from hell ) , and may even generate a laugh or two . and there are a few sly , witty one-liners . in general , however , a smile like yours comes across as lifeless and bland . in fact , it's so forgettable that , in a couple of months , i'll probably have to refer to this review to remember what it was about .

1	pssst , if you'll be very quiet , i'll sneak you inside the locked doors of one of hollywood's creative departments where some multimillion-dollar executives are planning their next movie . this is quite fortuitous , since it came close to hitting bonanza instead . with bonanza , they'd have to hire a big cast and do expensive location shooting , but , with a movie like my favorite martian , they can make it much cheaper . they need someone to write the script . stoner and oliver whipped out a quick , if bland , script for casper , another remake , so they could probably be counted on to do the same for my favorite martian . but as luck would have it , robin turns out to have been in a different old tv show , one called " mork & mindy . " such is the problem of being a 25-year-old executive , your memory only stretches back so far . they'll ask the writers to put in as much sexual innuendo as possible and throw in a bit of nudity - although not by her , it turns out - just so long as the movie gets no worse than a pg rating . my favorite martian runs just 1 : 32 . it got the pg rating they needed even with the sexual innuendo , brief nudity , mild profanity and monsters that will scare some little ones . they figure , probably correctly , that the film is appropriate for all ages even if they did push some limits . my son jeffrey , age 9 , probably summed it up best . he said that the movie was little more than a 30 minute tv show and gave it just * ? . 
1	most romantic comedies make it known early in the proceedings that they intend to follow all the time-honored , tried-and-true conventions of the genre by leading us down a well-trodden path littered with formulaic plots and overused character types . for the most part , 'til there was you , 1997's april romance movie , manages to avoid this trap , and , in the process , has the dubious distinction of making us wonder if by-the-numbers familiarity is necessarily a bad thing . in trying to be different by using the sleepless in seattle approach of keeping the main characters apart until the finale , 'til there was you feels like a joke without a punchline . the payoff , such as it is , is distressingly anticlimactic , and results in frustration . nevertheless , because the actors are charismatic and their characters are likable , the picture never loses its way . we look forward to the inevitable moment when the two will meet , but the script doesn't seem to be dragging its feet getting to that point . that's not the case with 'til there was you . although many of the details are different from those in sleepless , the approach and intent are the same . sadly , the rhythm is all wrong . part of the problem with 'til there was you is that the characters aren't all that compelling . and let's face it : mcdermott and tripplehorn aren't hanks and ryan . they don't light up the screen in such a way that their mere presence can save an otherwise-stillborn scene . and 'til there was you has many stagnant moments . at one- hundred twelve minutes , it runs too long and becomes unnecessarily involved in poorly-developed , uninteresting subplots ( like the one to save an " historically important " housing complex ) . the movie fails to divert us along the long and twisting road to their rendezvous . after that , the film hurries to the " happily ever after " conclusion without giving us the opportunity to care whether the relationship works . first time feature director scott winant and screenwriter winnie holzman have apparently forgotten why people go to romantic comedies . as disappointing as much of 'til there was you is , there are some high points . certain individual scenes -- gwen's revealing heart-to- heart with her father ( michael tucker ) , gwen and francesca's lively bathroom chat , and nick's final attempt to be truly honest with francesca -- work extremely well . i also appreciated the manner in which coincidence is woven throughout the script without the characters ever making mention of it ( for example , it's up to us to figure out that nick's father's uncle was gwen's grandmother's long lost love ) . unfortunately , the good parts of 'til there was you are oases in a desert . they can't save the whole thing , which , in the end , seems like nothing more ambitious than a sleepless in seattle wannabe . by definition , romantic comedies are supposed to be " feel good " experiences , but , rather than leaving its audience enchanted , 'til there was you trails dissatisfaction in its wake . 
1	screenplay : david koepp , based on the novel by michael crichton . director : steven spielberg . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , violence ) running time : 127 minutes . sure , the lizards in question were not entirely mechanical , but i got the point . it also turns out to be , more or less , more of the same . the lost world offers all the shallow characterization and pointless plotting of jurassic park without the sense of discovery . only in the hands of steven spielberg could that recipe add up to something moderately diverting instead of a compete disaster . in many ways , the lost world is actually an improvement over jurassic park , if for no other reason than that it is more honest . spielberg takes exactly two minutes to show us the first dinosaur in the lost world , clearly aware that there's no point in creating build-up any longer . he also takes a note from a clever line in david koepp's script given to malcolm : " yeah , ooh ahh . . . that's always how it starts . jurassic park was almost obliged to provide the wide-eyed wonder of the completely new ; the lost world , appropriately , delivers a much higher ratio of " running and screaming " to " ooh ahh . " it also doesn't have laura dern as a dumber-than-triceratops-dung paleobotanist , giggling like a schoolgirl over malcolm's description of chaos theory , or ariana richards shrieking about unix systems . what the lost world _does_ have is a generous helping of scenes and characters which are awfully familiar . pete postlethwaite plays this year's version of the great white hunter while arliss howard plays this year's version of the corporate scum ; the gallimimus stampede of jp becomes lost world's parasauralophus stampede . even the sequence of attacks feels derivative : t . rex attacks a vehicle and tries to push it over a cliff , t . rex chases people , people trek toward a distant goal , velociraptors take their turn . jurassic park was more enjoyable than it should have been because we had never seen this stuff before . lost world is the same stuff , just in greater quantities . those greater quantities are probably going to satisfy movie-goers who like their action fast and furious , with minimal interruption for silly little things like character development . no one will argue that that the lost world is much more than a string of set pieces ; there is also little question that a few of those set pieces are directed with that indescribable spielberg something . when spielberg is " on , " the results can be dizzying , and he's " on " just often enough to give the lost world a few satisfying sparks . like us , he's been there and done that . i believe i have seen jurassic park four times since its initial release , and i have enjoyed it less each time . if i had seen the lost world for the first time in 1993 -- if the order of the two films had been reversed -- i suspect i would have found it positively thrilling . in 1997 , it's just like watching jurassic park for the fifth time , when it's hard to get worked up over a film which has little going for it besides big mechanical lizards . 
1	perhaps the most noteworthy thing about corrina , corrina is that it's a rare mainstream hollywood motion picture which has been produced , directed , and written by the same person . this happens a lot with smaller , independent productions and foreign films , but it's unusual for a major release . unfortunately , jessie nelson's triple-duty is almost the only thing that's unique about this movie . her tale of interracial and intergenerational bonding offers a series of images that we've seen before . she won't talk , nor is she responsive to questions or requests . the apparent reason for this is to add a little racial tension to the mix . this is as average as a motion picture gets . the storyline is a screenplay-by-the-numbers , following certain set formulas that should be familiar to anyone who sees more than a handful of movies a year . the script ( which bears a resemblance to that of last year's little-seen house of cards--the kathleen turner/tommy lee jones feature , not the british miniseries ) adequately tells the tale without trying anything daring or inventive . the actress doesn't bring anything new to a role crying out for something fresh . a similar criticism can be leveled at ray liotta , whose manny often seems devoid of emotion . corrina , corrina might have been a better movie had the obligatory romance been purged altogether . the most interesting person in the movie is molly , and additional time spent examining her relationships with corrina and manny would have been welcome . her reaction to racial bigotry is also carefully sidestepped--two scenes allude to it , but the issue is never confronted head-on . taken as a whole , corrina , corrina is a lackluster production . its attempts at sincerity are stymied by cliched circumstances and stereotyped characters . the film suffers from the problem that afflicts all films traversing this familiar road : when viewers know the destination , and recognize the route being taken to reach it , there's not a lot to hold their interest . 
2	pollock , about the renowned and controversial modern artist jackson pollock , is at once intriguing and insightful as well as boring and baffling . ed harris , who stars as pollock , makes his directorial debut with the film . although clearly a labor of love on harris's part , the film amply demonstrates why most actors need someone other than themselves giving them guidance . harris delivers one of his best performances , indeed , another oscar worthy one , but his director spoils what could have been a masterpiece by letting scenes drag on and on . still , for anyone interested in the creative process , the movie can be quite rewarding . it is difficult to show exactly how an artist goes from a blank canvas to a fully realized vision . pollock tries by simply letting us observe pollock at work . with the intense performance by harris as a troubled artist , the creative tension is almost palpable . acting like a manic-depressive , harris portrays pollock as a troubled soul . that he was able to create anything memorable through that alcoholic haze is quite surprising . one well-staged drinking-and-driving episode best illustrates the depth of pollock's troubles . although his work was frequently criticized as consisting of little more than random splashes , pollock defends his technique . basically a one-man show , it does have many other characters in complementary roles . towards the end of the picture , jennifer connelly , who was so spectacular recently in requiem for a dream , plays another of her more typical throwaway roles as the beautiful but vapid ruth klingman , the last of pollock's mistresses . is pollock a beautiful failure or a flawed success ? like his paintings , it is in the eye of the beholder . for me , it was better than a documentary on the history channel and well worth seeing . in an unsympathetic and enigmatic performance , harris creates a fascinating , flawed man of flesh and blood , who throws temper tantrums like a toddler one minute and acts like a recluse the next . if you can stay awake through the long dull periods , you will learn a lot and get to witness one of the best performances of the year in the process . it is rated r for language and brief sexuality and would be acceptable for teenagers . 
0	have you heard the one about the mail order bride ? michael cristofer's original sin , a film which could spark a rebirth in the mail order bride business with men hoping to hit a jolie jackpot , is a costume drama sans any real drama . julia , in voice-over , explains , " no , this is not a love story , but a story about love . " with lush settings , handsome costumes and beautiful actors , the film does have some rewards , the plot not being one of them . you'll soon guess where the story is going , but you won't care . those purchasing tickets in hopes of seeing a guilty pleasure will likely be disappointed . as louis and julia engage in open-mouth kissing , they smack loudly like a couple of preschoolers woofing down greasy hamburgers . don't be shocked , but julia isn't faithful . maybe this is the original sin to which the title refers . it's certainly one that i haven't heard of before . of the many over-the-top moments in the picture , my favorite happens when louis comes riding at full gallop straight towards the audience . the editor speeds up the film so that it looks rather like a scene from an old keystone cops comedy . it's one of many unintentionally funny moments . " i love it , even the cheap melodrama , " julia says of the theater . well , i suspect that the only people who will love this melodrama will be those who enjoy it as something like an illustrated version of a harlequin romance novel . don't go , however , if you're looking for substance or for cheap thrills . original sin runs a long 1 : 56 . it is rated r for " strong sexual content and some violence " and would be acceptable for older teenagers . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
1	one of the most interesting things about just cause is the number of movies it manages to allude to and copy from . by the time the closing credits are rolling , a feeling of familiarity is not only likely , but justified . it's hard to imagine any film-goer not having seen at least one of this picture's antecedents . once the references to these films are played out , just cause offers one more " homage " ( that word sounds so much nicer than " theft " ) --to martin scorsese's graphic remake of cape fear . there's even an added attraction to the climactic in-the-water struggle , and this one could have been lifted from crocodile dundee ( or , more correctly , considering the location , alligator dundee ) . all-in-all , just cause obviously doesn't offer much that's new or attention-grabbing , but the presence of several top-notch actors makes the material more appealing that it has a right to be . connery captures our sympathy as the relentlessly upright practitioner of the law . harris , while not as deliciously evil as silence's anthony hopkins , is still riveting . supporting roles are ably filled by the likes of ned beatty , daniel j . travanti , and george plimpton . despite its tendency to tread well-traveled roads , just cause is filmed with enough energy and craft that , for the majority of its one- hundred minute running time , it's reasonably entertaining . things don't get out of control until the last quarter-hour , when the need to inject action revs up the pace a little too much . it's kind of unfortunate , really . but , after all , this is hollywood , where the success of movies is often based far more on noisy struggles to the death than on thoughtful endings . ultimately , the only thing noteworthy about just cause's climax is how nicely cinematographer lajos koltai managed to photograph the final scenes . while that may be acceptable to the popcorn-munching crowd , those of us who want a little more will find this film lacking . 
0	a superficial b- movie about flying saucers , offering no relevant views on matters of space exploration , except some might be amused to see washington d . c . come under attack by flying saucers . using ray harryhausen's flying saucers , this film becomes mostly a special effect experience . it is a good example of the kind of mediocre , paranoiac sci-fi films that were being made at the time . though , the exception to this uninteresting sci-fi film at the time , might be the one adapted from robert heinlein's novel " rocketship galileo , " which was made as " destination moon ( 50 ) . " but it wasn't until kubrick came along in the 1960s with his " 2001 : a space odyssey " that sci-fi films matured into solid ventures and started to be taken seriously . the silliness of the film is delightfully highlighted by the finale of the flying saucer attack on washington dc . its use was argued against , by major huglin , that it would only destroy our country and might not even work against the aliens . the film becomes a classic in sci-fi for its special effects , despite how mundane everything else about this project is . 
0	an enigmatic thriller that never quite gets going . it's always too enigmatic and bleak , and its surprise ending falls like a dead weight into a waterfalls . it's a film that successfully and darkly explores the motives of its three female characters and their ambiguous relationships with others . 
1	director : steven zaillian . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 118 minutes . for those unfamiliar with the american legal system -- and count it among your blessings if you are one of them -- it is not generally the stuff of which great drama is made . it is a thing of motions , pleadings , depositions and causes of action , of hundreds of hours spent reading thousands of incoming documents , or redacting thousands of outgoing documents . it is a war of attrition played out in conference rooms , only rarely involving tense attorney-witness confrontations or even-more-tense waits for a verdict . cinematic law is a satisfying fiction ; real law is , for the most part , a laborious game of chicken before an out-of-court settlement . there was every reason to believe that , if anyone could lend a spark to slogging through the legal mire , it would be steven zaillian . this was , after all , the director who made chess both kinetic and poetic in searching for bobby fischer . unfortunately , it pulls all its punches when it comes to giving the story an emotional hook . schlichtmann's conversion from shark to softy is supposed to anchor the film , except that it's far too subtle . in fact , travolta often plays schlichtmann as though his concern is always still about the money , his frustration less about letting his clients down than about letting the big one slip away -- which , frankly , is a more interesting choice . as the film slowly becomes the story of how the woburn case drains all the cash out of schlichtmann and his firm , it slowly drains what little narrative and visual energy it had . certainly much of that energy was supposed to be provided by robert duvall as jerry facher , beatrice's eccentric veteran attorney . i suppose the idea is that he's wily because he passes himself off as such a goof , but the character's tics -- taping up an ancient briefcase covered in snagglepuss decals ; absently bouncing a ball during a phone conversation ; obsessing over the red sox -- are more often distracting than they are entertaining . at least duvall's fussy colorfulness , along with william h . macy's less-mannered breakdown as schlichtmann's nervous accountant , give you something to watch . too often a civil action feels like the sort of lecture in legal maneuvering we see facher give to students at harvard law . it runs out of gas when it runs out of things to tell us , since it lacks characters to engage us . real law makes the appeal of john grisham-esque courtroom melodrama make a lot more sense . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
2	there's an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last . george lucas certainly didn't follow that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy . return of the jedi , the final installment of the series , is easily the least innovative and most hokey of the three films . if luke , han , leia , and vader were replaced by nameless , faceless characters , return of the jedi wouldn't be a whole lot more interesting than independence day . cuteness is the watchword here . the dark , eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone . even darth vader doesn't seem very daunting this time around . return of the jedi has some interesting elements . the luke/vader/emperor scenes are suitably tense and well-acted , and , if the resolution isn't a complete surprise , at least it's a little more original that it could have been . from a technical point-of-view , the space battles are amazing , easily dwarfing anything depicted in the previous films . not only are there many , many more ships , but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved . on one level , return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects . additionally , there are some impressive touches tacked onto the ending . once again , while the improvements don't significantly alter the viewing experience , they're fun to spot . first and foremost are the ewoks , an unbearably cuddly race that seem handpicked to generate toy sales . then there's the unbelievably cheap cop-out that lucas uses to erase the luke/han/leia triangle . whether lucas had this in mind from the beginning is irrelevant -- it's a bad idea . not only does it defuse romantic tension , but it leaves viewers shaking their heads in incredulity . there are other problems too -- the death toll on the rebel side seems shockingly small for a " final battle " and a bit of foreshadowing regarding the millennium falcon's fate is thrown out the window . of course , i could also make the rather obvious observation that large elements of return of the jedi are lifted from the original star wars , indicating that the creative wellspring of writers george lucas and lawrence kasdan had perhaps run dry . the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films . as in empire , billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for . newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy , cunning , and evil creature , although he's not as imposing as vader was in star wars . although it was great fun re-watching star wars and the empire strikes back again on the big screen , return of the jedi doesn't generate the same sense of enjoyment . and , while lucas worked diligently to re-invigorate each entry into the trilogy , jedi needs more than the patches of improved sound , cleaned-up visuals , and a few new scenes . still , despite the flaws , this is still star wars , and , as such , represents a couple of lightly-entertaining hours spent with characters we have gotten to know and love over the years . return of the jedi is easily the weakest of the series , but its position as the conclusion makes it a must-see for anyone who has enjoyed its predecessors . 
2	me , myself & irene ( 20th century fox ) starring : jim carrey , renee zellweger , chris cooper , robert forster , richard jenkins , anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon . screenplay : peter farrelly & mike cerrone & bobby farrelly . directors : bobby farrelly & peter farrelly . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 116 minutes . the national alliance for the mentally ill went public ten days before the release of me , myself & irene with a protest of the film's flippant tone towards multiple personality disorders . they were offended , which is not an uncommon reaction to a farrelly brothers movie . in fact , it was probably a shrewd move on nami's part to beat the rush condemning me , myself & irene . farrelly brothers movies -- including kingpin and there's something about mary -- are tasteless , crude and , yes , occasionally offensive . they're also funny in the sort of i-can't-believe-i-actually-saw-that way usually associated with vintage mel brooks , or the zucker-abrahams-zucker team . there's nothing remotely ennobling about me , myself & irene , the story of charlie baileygates ( jim carrey ) , a rhode island state trooper with a little problem . fans of there's something about mary -- and i count myself quite squarely among them -- may find irene a bit disappointing by comparison . carrey and zellweger aren't nearly the perfect comic odd couple ben stiller and cameron diaz were , nor is carrey the sort of comic performer whose ordinary guy demeanor works to balance the farrellys' warped sensibilities . the story is an unnecessarily convoluted parade of double-crossing characters involved in a dirty business deal the specific nature of which i still can't explain . there are a few missed opportunities , like ignoring genial narrator rex allen , jr . for much of the film . and like the farrellys' previous films , it's easily 15 minutes longer than it needs to be , padded with musical cues that only distract from the real reason for watching a farrelly brothers movie : seeing what gut-busting affront to good taste they'll come up with next . mere words can't possibly do justice to those affronts . irene's finest moments may not reach the epic heights of mary's zipper or hair gel scenes , but they come close . sometimes it seems that it's a long time between laughs in a farrelly brothers movie , but maybe that's a good thing . often , you still haven't recovered from the last one five minutes ago by the time the next one rolls around . i'm not about to delve into whether or not nami was " right " in criticizing irene for its approach to multiple personality disorder , including repeatedly using " schizo " as a synonym . i do know that me , myself & irene strikes me as a wildly comic spin on the incredible hulk more than anything else , with carrey's contorted transformations a special effect all by themselves . that's only part of the amazingly adept physical comedy carrey pulls off , battling with his own body like steve martin in all of me . . . or , come to think of it , like carrey himself in liar liar . me , myself & irene may be uneven and peculiarly violent in its resolution , but it's pure in its refusal to sentimentalize anything . everything is profane and nothing sacred in the farrelly universe . maybe that is worth protesting . or maybe , when you're laughing so hard that you forget to be offended , it's worth applauding . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	in his forceful and blunt way , hiding his violent tendencies with the warmest smile in st . petersburg , he professes to have a real romantic interest in her , sincerely sympathizing with her that men are often beating her up . she seems to so passively accept her beatings as part of her life , which i guess is symbolic of how russia treats its women . everything that we learn about the new russian attitudes comes from seeing it through danila's naive eyes . this scene for one thing tells how xenophobic the russians have always been and still are . his mindlessness and quiet charm , and the heroic qualities he often displays , are both chilling and pitiful to observe . if anything , this slickly done gangster thriller , should be taken as a political warning by the west that russia is a wounded animal and still dangerous , and a wounded animal is frightened and will often do anything to lash out at those it perceives as hurting it . there were many diverting scenes that make that point crystal clear . his performance gives the film a reverberating force , depicting the chaos currently going on in a deteriorating country , and how difficult it would be to reach someone like him , when he can be so deceptive by just smiling and so distant by tuning out what he doesn't want to hear . it is in his soul that rests the centuries of russia's life of misery and war , whose struggle is never over but always seems to be just beginning . he has infused the film with a raw power , that touches the nerves of the things that westerners understand the least about the russians . all this makes for a fascinating film , one that is popular in russia , and is quite different from the usual russian films exported to america . it is one of the most insightful films i have seen about modern russia and how organized crime has taken a foothold in the country . it is a film that has its finger on the problems the severe economic decay in russia and the rise of criminals to fill the void of a lost morality , has caused . this film has the look and tone of those old american b movies , but with a little more depth in its political aims and much more pessimism for its country'sfuture . 
2	writer-director/acting star-artist , takashi kitano , has broken ground from traditional films , taking risks that defy explaining how to classify this very violent and tender film , that sways between the two extremes , and as the critic joel hoberman so astutely states , fireworks is a cross between ozu's late spring and don siegel's dirty harry . kitano is not noted for plot development and for understanding women . his forte is in the raw nerve of his films and the stark beauty of the cinematography . one should expect the unexpected from his films . the violence is brutal and fast-paced . the narrative is told in flashbacks , so any part of nishi's life could pop up on the screen , and what would seem like a commonplace crime story unfolding , deceptively turns out to be much more than that , even as nishi gets revenge on the yakuma's who did this to his friend , unafraid of bringing untold graphic violence to the screen . you better believe that caught my attention . but , if that was all this film was about , the dirty harry description of the film would have been completely apropos . this highly original film , that is at times a masterpiece and other times a grade b- movie , is difficult for me to penetrate what it all means as far as a commentary on japanese culture , but the japanese critics have been critical of his attacks on japanese conformity , while the japanese public accepts him as a popular performer and stage comedian , even if his films have not been as well received in japan as they have been in foreign countries . as far as i am concerned , i prefer ozu , i am more taken with his intellect and perspective , but i can appreciate the artistic direction kitano is taking his violent subject matter to , as i found this volatile film to be something special , but something i can't completely comprehend because i don't really know what he is trying to say , as if that really matters . yet his film is a visual treat to behold , and for that i am grateful and accepting of his work . 
1	unzipped is a documentary by first time director douglas keeve . in short , the movie is a hoot and a lot of fun . the naturally hilarious antics of mizrahi save the movie no matter how amateurish the production . the movie is full of uproarious dialog . he muses that " all i want to do is fur pants , but i know that if do them , i will be stoned off of fifth avenue . " watching the preparation for the fashion show we get to see the models interviewing for positions . i don't think he hired her , but it is not clear . cindy crawford has one of the better lines . my pores are not that small . " mainly what works in the show is the dialog and the mannerisms , but there is one special scene that has neither . the ugly snow is a apt metaphor for his emotions and the cinematography captures it perfectly . he asks his models if they would mind changing clothes behind the scrim so that the audience could see them . most models agree , but some reject the proposal . coming back to the poor quality of the documentary , it is as much of a mess as is mizrahi's hair . just as we learn in the movie , that mizrahi has a stylist that works hard to give him just the right messy look , so it is clear that keeve likes having a movie that makes you feel sure that you could do better with your own camcorder . the cinematography by ellen kuras is almost a parody of bad film making . many scenes are so white , they may be scenes of polar bears in siberia for all i know . i am sure kuras shot tons of film and most of it has to be better than what we are shown . although most of the film is in black and white , the few color scenes are in perfect focus and well lit . sometimes the camera is dropped , but hey , why not show these mistakes to the audience too . suffice it to say that the filming and the editing are too cute for words . i kept wanting to scream while watching it . unzipped reminds me of the wonderful british tv show , the house of elliot . they are both about fashion designers who are working extremely hard to be a success and both are high energy shows . finally , the music in unzipped , especially during the runway scenes of the fashion show , is great and full of energy . you want to go see one of these shows yourself and soon . it is not rated , but would probably be pg-13 for a little profanity and models in their underwear . any teenager could see it with no problems . if you feel like a fun show where you can just have a good time , i recommend unzipped to you , and i award it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	however , while hoskins' performance is laudable , the movie as a whole is a letdown -- oddly paced , erratically scripted , and with a message that is so obvious that i felt like i was being bludgeoned to death with it . the story behind the film's director is more interesting than the movie itself . but , while his style evidences the edginess one might expect from someone with his background , meadows' approach doesn't seem any more remarkable than that of many of today's new generation of film makers . before seeing the movie , everything i had heard about twentyfourseven indicated that it is a " stunning " feature ; twelve hours after the closing credits rolled , i'm still waiting to be stunned . while the final twenty minutes of twentyfourseven is effective ( and even a little shocking ) , it doesn't erase the weakness of the predictable melodrama that precedes it . for much of its running time , the film doesn't go anywhere -- it's a relatively uninspired look at how a bunch of directionless kids turn their lives around by finding the meaning of life in a boxing ring . this is a standard plot , and , aside from the black-and-white , pseudo-documentary look of the film , meadows doesn't offer anything new . none of the characters , with the possible exception of darcy , are well-developed . in the end , it's hard to care about any of them -- whether they live , die , climb out of the hole dug for them by thatcherism , or fall back into it . meadows has crafted a movie with a stark appearance , but one that doesn't have much of a heart . it's also worth questioning the idea that it's a good thing for teen boys to harness their unrest by climbing into a boxing ring and beating each other bloody . twentyfourseven isn't the only recent movie to embrace this tactic -- last year's the boxer used the same approach . is this really the best solution ? then the spirit of competition is still alive , but it's tempered by a strong sense of being part of a team , and the victim is a ball , not someone else's face . while it's occasionally evident that we're not watching seasoned thespians , it's never a serious problem , since most of the performances are credible . hoskins displays great range as darcy -- depending on the circumstances , he can be a funny , tragic , heroic , or horrific figure . it's unfortunate that the actor's efforts couldn't have been focused on a better-developed individual . twentyfourseven is supposed to be one of those gritty , coming-of- age stories cut from the same cloth as boyz 'n the hood and hate -- a movie that shows life in poverty-stricken , urban neighborhoods the way it really is . but , while twentyfourseven was filmed in a crime- infested , economically ravaged area , the power and urgency of the setting is not conveyed through the narrative . meadows clearly has ambition and desire , and he may have a bright future as a film maker , but twentyfourseven lacks the focus and drive necessary for a breakthrough feature . the picture may be about violence inside and outside of the ring , but raging bull this isn't . " my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . " -- david puttnam 
1	an updated version from the '60s one , remade with a fresher theme that is fit for the '90s . the caper is also more fun to watch , has much more splash to its story line , and is better looking than the original . in many ways it's a better overall film than the steve mcqueen one , but retains the same trashy disposable entertainment value . no one will mistake this middle brow venture for an art film . the film looked so glossy and flew by at such an easygoing pace , that it was an enjoyable guilty pleasure , a delicious hollywood film for those looking for escapism and a romance that portends to be steamy and intimate , but is really glib and only superficially satisfying . it's more like a james bond film in its banal idea of what love and adventure is , as the film rolls out the big-ticket items to impress the viewer . there is no end to the bounty of materialism in this film . in the closing scene , he steals another valuable picture hanging near the monet for catherine's sake , but he also puts the monet back in its place in the museum . it was an ingenious scene , where many impersonators of a magritte painting , who are dressed in imitation of the picture , as inconspicuous businessmen in dark suits and bowler hats , carrying briefcases , make it difficult for the police to keep tabs on them all . it's a fantasy film fantasizing how good it would be to have so much money that you can do anything you wanted . the emptiness of those pleasures rival the film's empty look at romance and adventure , and should give one pause to think how disappointing it sometimes might be to get what one wishes for . this is an easy film to take it as it is ! it is a well-crafted star vehicle , whose stars have a good chemistry together , and there is a bonus--it comes with gorgeous location shots and lots of plot twists . 
2	the unabashedly sentimental , english-language film the legend of 1900 by writer and director giuseppe tornatore ( cinema paradiso ) is based on a popular italian monologue by alessandro baricco . the first time he plays , the entire ship is awakened by the sublime sounds . the film itself is a wonderful treat for the ears and the eyes . the mesmerizing music must be enough for 2 cds , and the cinematography is warmly romantic , as are the handsome sets . knowing that the film had garnered considerable negative , early buzz in the press as being sappy , i approached it with no small amount of trepidation . maybe this film isn't for everyone , but if you are able to open your heart to its romantic rhythms , you may be as transfixed as i was . as i watched it , it kept reminding me of once upon a time in america , an admittedly better movie , in its grandeur , its intimacy , its period and its sounds . the director , as he did in his award winning cinema paradiso , knows how to stage scenes with a delightfully whimsical touch and a visually audacious flair . the piano glides wildly all over the ballroom as 1900 plays luxurious music on it . not many directors would attempt choreography with a grand piano as the sole dancer . another one of the movie's wonderful moments occurs when jelly roll morton , who proudly claims to be " the man who invented jazz , " drops by the ship to challenge 1900 to a musical duel . clearly enjoying every minute of it , a suave-looking clarence williams iii ( " mod squad " ) does a delicious turn as a jazz legend . in a movie whose biggest problem is that its narrative is allowed too often to get lost at sea , the director makes the right decision here in letting the battle of piano titans go on much longer than you'd ever expect . 1900's strategy and the way the contest is decided are both quite surprising . the story casts a spell on you as the music flows through your soul . although it's more a tone poem than a motion picture , it has a seductive appeal . " the end , the end , please just show me where it ends , " 1900 begs max . the movie itself ends predictably but poetically . and it's the type of movie that either you'll love or you'll hate . count me in the former category . it is rated r for brief strong language . if you don't mind your children hearing the f-word a few times , mainly as a replacement for " darn , " and if your children like sentimental yarns , then they are old enough to see the film . 
1	the commercials for my life make a big deal out of this as being " from the creators of ghost , " and for good reason . much of the same heartwrenching , occasionally cloying , sentiment is present here . those who hate tear-jerkers should resolutely avoid this film ; my life will leave that crowd retching in the aisles . actually , when the film tunes down the manipulation , it has some genuinely moving and emotionally honest moments . ironically , the most " real " scenes are those of bob videotaping himself . his confessions , reflections , and comments seem far more genuine than any of the numerous melodramatic scenes that have bob actively confronting the realities of life and death . my life lays it on thick in the drawn-out final fifteen minutes , and this hamstrings the project somewhat ( you could hear a lot of nose-blowing in the darkened confines of the theater ) . not that this is a surprise ; fifteen minutes into the movie , it's pretty obvious how it's going to end . overall , the scenes that work outnumber those that fail , and that's reason enough for a die-hard cynic like myself to admit grudgingly to having liked my life . there's enough intelligent stuff contained herein to keep most viewers from dwelling on the maudlin shortcomings . this is no untamed heart , with an impossible-to-accept premise and cringingly bad overacting ; my life may have obvious intentions , but at least it's skillful in presenting them . michael keaton does a fine job as bob jones , and it may be the quality of his performance that makes much of my life work . certainly , even his most ridiculous scenes ( such as where he storms into his doctor's office and informs him : " you can't take away my hope ! it's all i have left ! " ) aren't too painful to sit through . coupled with finely-acted moments when it's possible to feel gail's grief , there are times when ms . kidman doesn't bring enough substance to her character . this may be as much ( or more ) the fault of the writing as that of the actress , though , since it's hard to be consistently sincere uttering the occasional dumb line . haing s . ngor is so good that the scenes featuring chinese mysticism seem less foolish than they might otherwise . it's difficult to predict how tear-jerkers will perform at the box office since this , more than any other class of motion picture , brings out the public's fickle nature . my life isn't a russian tragedy , so there's exhilaration amidst the heartbreak , and the gallows humor manages to avoid being tasteless . those who go to this film expecting to like it probably will , and those who don't , won't . my life is good schmaltz--decent entertainment that has no qualms about mucking around with the audience's emotions ( thus making it a prime " date movie " ) . in addition to being far too blatant about its motives and having a plot that offers almost no surprises , the movie suffers from an unfortunate case of " cuteness " . stone-hearted movie-goers beware--many of you will loathe this film , and those that don't will probably have a hard time justifying how you could actually like it . 
1	the fortress is not a nice place , and its director ( kurtwood smith ) is an emotionless servant of machines . every time a movie about the near future presents such a bleak picture of life on earth , i always hope for a reasonable explanation about how things got so bad . personally , i don't think that's too much to ask . however , for the most part , the film makers don't agree ( apologies to pictures such as the terminator series ) , since they could care less about such details . fortress falls right into that category . we can make a few guesses based on clues presented in the film , but even the best picture will be incomplete . the pattern of this film is unusual . most movies , no matter how good or bad , have peaks and valleys during the course of their running time . fortress , on the other hand , while starting at a pretty high level , manages a consistent downward trend throughout . it's somewhat out-of-the-ordinary to be able to say that a movie gets uniformly worse with every passing scene . it's only the strength of the beginning that keeps this film from collapsing into the nether regions inhabited by such nightmares as split second , another science fiction gorefest that takes place in a dreary near-future earth . the early minutes of fortress are brimming with promise . scenes bristle with the potential of interesting characters , strong interaction , and intelligent plot twists . alas , little or nothing comes of most of these instances ; they become a method of cruel teasing , tantalizing the viewer with what might have been . the film degenerates from intriguing to routine to dumb , all in the space of ninety minutes . by the end , it's all formula . the action has become commonplace and the characters flat . the cast does a reasonable job . christopher lambert is probably a better actor than the role deserves , and he occasionally manages to make jack brennick believable . lincoln kilpatrick does as much as he can with a secondary part , creating one of the few minor characters that the audiences comes to care about . ultimately , fortress is nonsense , even if the slick futuristic setting tries to put a new spin on the tried and true chase sequences . it's also at this point that significant plot implausibilities start cropping up . one thing fortress has going for is an impressive visual style--at least for those who can stand a lot of gore . there are exploding stomachs , dismembered bodies , and a great deal of blood--all done quite graphically , for the most part ( would you expect anything different from the director of re-animator ? ) . the set design is excellent , and the action scenes are well-paced , if lacking in legitimate surprises . fortress isn't terrible science fiction , but it's far from the top . hampered by a storyline that never reverses a downward trend , the movie is unable to get on course . not the best company to be in , but it could be worse . watch split second and you'll understand how bad things can get in this genre . after that experience , fortress will look like high art . 
1	director : lasse halstrom . mpaa rating : r ( adult themes , profanity , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 125 minutes . a word of sympathy , first of all , for the marketing and publicity people at miramax films . i guarantee you i would not want the job of selling to the american public a film in which the character arc of the protagonist is completed by performing an abortion . they'll avoid the subject assiduously , of course , focusing instead on the idea that the cider house rules is about a journey to self-awareness , about learning to make complex choices , and so on , and et cetera , and yada yada , all of which is even ( more or less ) true . it's also true that john irving has no qualms about being provocative , and that he's willing to cast performing abortions in a quasi-heroic light if it serves the purpose of one of his uniquely compassionate tales . the cider house rules isn't worth avoiding simply because of that one thematic element . . . nor , unfortunately , it is particularly worth seeking out . the relationship between larch and homer is the focal point , a strange father-son connection that gives two actors intriguing material to work with . caine is particularly good as larch , playing devilish advocate regarding the harsh realities of the world . irving tries to wink at the mawkishness ( plenty of dickensian references abound ) , but director lasse hallstrom spends a bit too much time lingering on the orphans' upturned faces . for a story that's ultimately not about orphans , the opening of the cider house rules is too much about orphans . to that end , tobey maguire proves to be a marvelous homer wells . his performance is a challenging mix of innocence and experience ; his face captures both a hard life and a life lived in isolation . he's certainly the best choice for an irving protagonist since robin williams' garp , but the cider house rules still can't quite achieve irving-style magic , even with irving himself doing the script honors . the narrative meanders appropriately between homer's relationship with candy , his work with the apple-picking crew and life back at the orphanage , yet the meandering just doesn't have that whimsical sense of purpose that marks irving's novels . it is most worth noting that the cider house rules on film packs 15 years of homer's life into about a year and a half . there may be no better evidence that irving is a writer whose stories really need to be turned into mini-series . the film does do a nice job conveying the theme that " situational morality " need not be an epithet ; indeed , this is may be one of the most deeply radical concepts you'll see on film this year . it is there you see a glimmer of the literary irving , one of the glimmers you can see in maguire and caine . too often , though , those glimmers are obscured by conventional filmmaking . maybe those marketing folk don't have such a tough job after all . in the cider house rules , you have to work a little too hard to find irving the provocateur . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
2	you may have trouble believing a few of the characters' reactions , but , if you haven't yet come to appreciate jennifer beals's acting talents , you will after watching this movie . beals said she likes scripts like this one that make her " want to take care of the character , " which she does here with grace and power , stealing the movie from a good cast . using both his comedic and his dramatic skills , fraser gives an unflinchingly strong performance . " he would have come , but he wasn't invited . " lest we think the attitude problem lies in any way with david , his mother certainly lets us know how deep her homophobia goes . many viewers will find that the actions of the characters sometimes stretch credulity , but the script , with one exception , never goes too far afield . you may loathe the way that david and his friends are treated , but the movie doesn't make the parents into easy-to-write-off devils . they are in many ways wonderful parents , unlike rob's parents who are uniformly oppressive . the story's first act uses some hilarious but biting comedy to relax and entertain the audience . " they're never sure . they just tell you enough to destroy you . " as suzanne and rob are just starting to grapple with the issue of whether to keep or abort the gay fetus , david is busy with his opera production . he's presenting a small-scale -- 6 hour rather than the normal 23 hour --version of wagner's ring cycle . just when you've pushed back in your chair and relaxed a bit , the more intense second act begins and the comedy turns to drama . second-time director ross kagan marks is more adept at the comedic portions of the story that the drama . the first act flows rapidly and smoothly and scores just as many points about the tragedy of the situation as the dramatic second act . any flaws in the direction , however , are ameliorated by the quietly dominating performance of jennifer beals . even in the second act , the comedy provides much of the dramatic punch . david asks , for example , " what if orson welles's mom didn't want a fat one ? " most of the problems with the story come back to basic plausibility . assuming that there is a 90% accurate test that can predict homosexuality is a stretch . and then late in the story there is a tragedy that is so clearly nothing more than a cheap plot device that it again reminds us of the weaknesses of the storyline . yet even with its limitations , the movie knows how to touch your heart and tickle your funny bone . it is rated pg-13 for mature themes and a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up . 
0	" tea with mussolini " is based on the semiautobiography of the film's director and co-screenwriter franco zeffirelli . these english expatriates feel very comfortable to be in italy , excited by the civilizing nature of all the art around them . because of her biting tongue , she is known as the i scorpioni , a name that unfairly sticks to this gaggle of english ladies , since lady hester seems to be the only one with acid on her tongue . lily tomlin is the american in the group , a bold lesbian archeologist , in a role that is inconsequential , she doesn't even have any funny lines , but she's always smiling , dressed in pants , and sunburned ( the reason for her being so happy , is that she is probably daydreaming about some of the better films she has been in ) . she has the most embarrassing line in the film , as she explains to luca why she remains in italy , " i have warmed both hands before the fires of michelangelo and botticelli . " lady hester sets the tone and proper standards for how this snooty group behaves . the film ends on a melodramatic note , and if this wasn't supposed to be a true story , it would be one that was hard to fathom . this was a ridiculous movie ; it was an apathetic sudser with flat dialogue , stiff characterizations , and if it didn't take place in florence , where art is a way of life , this film would be a feckless fiasco . it is hard to believe that luca is franco zeffirelli , he seemed so out of it , the role seemed to have nothing to say , as if he wasn't there when he was there , and his heroics as a 17-year-old with the resistance movement seemed unconvincing . also , the actor who played him , baird wallace , was very stiff and made his presence felt in a very awkward manner . since the film is supposedly about the director blossoming to become a great artist , i saw no evidence of this . this is a fourth-rate production . 
2	" it's gonna work . it's perfect . " scott b . smith's script for a simple plan , based on his best selling novel , is a carefully crafted character study with challenging moral dilemmas . hank , played by bill paxton from twister , is the group's brain and conscience . the press notes appropriately invoke the name of hitchcock . hitchcock would have naturally been drawn to this tale of average people caught up in a web from which they seem incapable of extricating themselves . they saw the story as having the stark simplicity of a poem , and they wanted the viewer's attention focused on the characters . the director , never missing a beat , keeps the audience guessing the story's resolution until almost the last minute . it is rated r for violence and profanity and would be fine for teenagers . 
1	at the 1998 sundance film festival , writer/director boaz yakin commented that a price above rubies isn't so much specifically about life in the hasidic jewish community as it is about " being an individual in any society where conformity and tradition dominate . " the story could just as easily have taken place in the amish country , apparently , or in any other highly conservative culture . in a cinematic era of hot air and gimmickry , it's hard to fault a film-maker when he's trying to tell a story _about_ something . unfortunately for yakin , beginning with a theme doesn't work when the cultural atmosphere is as crucial to a story as hasidic judaism is to a price above rubies . you can feel the world shifting constantly within her , conveyed through the naked emotionalism of zellweger's performance . it's a movie set with costumes and props , into which sonia might just as well have been dropped like an alien into a spielbergian american suburb . yakin commits himself so thoroughly to making sonia a genuinely complex character that he doesn't take the time to fill in the background . it certainly doesn't help that some of the blind-to-a-fault casting stretches credulity to the breaking point . british actor christopher eccleston chews on his new yawk accent as though he were about to blow a bubble with it , while creating a borderline melodramatic rendition of manipulative villainy . if you want to distill what doesn't work in a price above rubies into two words , try to imagine renee zellweger convincingly uttering the magic words , " oy gevalt . " a price above rubies is the sort of sincere , well-meaning movie which makes you feel vaguely guilty for not liking it more , since it is never sincere and well-meaning in that ponderous , self-righteous way which characterizes so many hollywood " issue " dramas . there are some wonderful touches to enjoy , notably an insinuating score by lesley barber , which complement yakin's patient narrative development . sonia's story of self-actualization is bound to resonate with some viewers , because it is both heartfelt and honest . but while yakin manages to make the film feel honest , he doesn't make it feel _true_ . without the richness of a fully-realized society as a foundation for character study , a price above rubies essentially offers solid actors in an under-stated tolerance lecture . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
2	cast : enrico lo verso , carmelo di mazzarelli , michele placido director : gianni amelio producers : mario and vittorio cecchi gori screenplay : gianni amelio , andrea porporati , and alessandro sermoneta cinematography : luca bigazzi music : franco piersanti u . s . distributor : undetermined in italian with subtitles lamerica , which had its united states debut at the 1995 new york film festival , is a deceptively simple modern-day story steeped in history , national identity , and other quintessential issues of the " human experience . " written and directed by acclaimed italian film maker gianni amelio ( open doors , stolen children ) , this motion picture is a must-see for cinema purists , art film lovers , and those who enjoy thinking their way through a movie . lamerica is definitely not for those on a quest for escapist fare--they'll be asleep before the end of the second reel . this production is paced slower than a tortoise . to understand the film , which takes place in 1991 albania , a little history is necessary . in terms of the issues it addresses , lamerica is an exceptionally rich film . , and as much a dark comedy as a straight drama . italian , albanian , or something else--in the trenches of life , at the most basic level of humanity , nationality has no meaning . the dynamic between gino and talarico is perhaps the most fascinating element of lamerica . the presence of enrico lo verso , who had the lead role in that film , emphasizes thematic similarities . there is still other ground covered by lamerica , as it goes beyond its cornerstone themes to address such diverse topics as the influence of television , the dehumanizing power of greed , and the difficulties of immigration control . from start to finish , this film is crowded with thought-provoking issues , each highlighted by one or more vignettes . the downside to such a wealth of intellectual material is that characters occasionally become subservient to themes . amelio's leads aren't the easiest to identify with emotionally , and there are times when they become nebulous as the script grapples with universal concepts . lamerica certainly isn't for everyone . in fact , the " average " movie-goer will likely find this to be a dull two hours . the more you consider what's in amelio's latest picture , the more impressed you become by the film's scope . lamerica is the kind of story that stays with a viewer long after the theater has emptied , and whose impact is magnified by thought and discussion afterward . 
1	it overflows with overly droll english comedy . although there are some nice lines in the film , i suspect that unless you are a fan of this genre of british comedy you may be as unmoved as i was . for people who like bbc tv shows like " to the manor born " , this may be just your cup of tea , but for me , i need more than overdrawn bizarre characters with thick accents to like a show . although i found some of the script by malcolm bradbury and stella gibbons interesting , i did not laugh once . not a good sign for a comedy . the large audience i was in laughed a lot during the physical comedy like the mass twitching heads scene , but generally was pretty silent for a comedy . i started to say they laughed during the really stupid parts , but decided that was too much of a value judgment , but notice like a good lawyer , i managed to say it anyway . let me say right now that her acting is the bright shining star in this dismal film . the farm looks like a sixteenth century farm that has been neglected . he refuses modern implements like cloths or sponges . i did not like sheila burrell at all in this role save her good scene at the end . as she puts it , " nature's all very well in her place , but there's no reason to be untidy . " one of my favorite minor characters appears in my least favorite scene . like the apostles of old , i'll go about the land . " in this same religious vein , a character named charles observes , " we are all purified by suffering . " the film is a cornucopia of strange characters . it's red meat time in the movies . " there is even a takeoff on the ending of gone with the wind , which i think is the funniest scene in the show . the sweet ending of the picture is well done and a bit of a surprise . finally , if you wonder , like me , where you saw maria miles who plays elfine starkadder before , she played anna in kafka , but i think i have must have seen in other things as well . cold comfort farm runs 1 : 44 , but i would have been preferred a lot less . it is not subtitled , but the extremely thick sussex accents are frequently unintelligible . i've been to sussex several times , and i though i was fluent in the language . the film is rated pg-13 . there is some sex , no nudity , no violence , and fairly mild language . i think the show would be fine for kids over say 9 or 10 . if you like this brand of droll english comedy of manners , then you may like the show , but i did not so i can not recommend it . i give it * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : may 30 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	david diamond and david weissman's imaginative script is equal parts sliding doors , a christmas carol and it's a wonderful life . director brett ratner , known for his broad comedy rush hour , shows that he is capable of surprising subtlety and grace . the family man is touching and poignant without ever getting anywhere near schmaltz . even if it's more effective as a romantic drama than a comedy , it does have many wonderfully funny moments . currently with model-quality girlfriends , jack doesn't seem the least bit interested in ever dialing kate's number . cage's frozen , wide-eyed expression tells it all about his absolute panic . in a film about cage's character , leoni does a terrific job of not being upstaged by cage . she takes what could just be a one-dimensional character and gives it depth , tenderness and a playful joy . the big question about the narrative is how the story will circle back once the glimpse is over . with a completely satisfying resolution , the movie leaves you with a warm spot in your heart . a perfect film for the christmas season , its messages about the meaning of success and the importance of family is presented with straightforward and genuine warmth . an honest picture and a cute one , although not worthy of christmas classic status , it is rewarding and enjoyable . it is rated pg-13 for sensuality and some language and would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up . my son jeffrey , age 11 , thought the film was " okay " and gave it * * . in the silicon valley it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . 
2	with sagacity and determination , tom has much to teach the equine and human characters in this delicate drama . robert redford , whose only oscar was for his direction of the brilliant and devastating ordinary people from 1980 , accepts the challenge of directing himself in the starring role in the horse whisperer . quite unlike what passes for drama today , the horse whisperer contains deeply felt and complex emotions but without shouting or profanity . coming in at just under three hours - redford's first cut was close to four , the movie so mesmerizes you that your only complaint is likely to be that you wish it were longer . as robert , character actor sam neill imbues the role with just the right mixture of bland but genuine allegiance to his family . " am i being too polite here ? " he asks . " does 'no' in montana mean 'yes' where you are ? " richardson is even better with the close-ups than the sweeping vistas . the intricate raindrops on the windshield are one of the many little treats he serves up for us . " do they have any signs around here ? " " what would they say ? " although the script does have these occasional bits of humor , it is in the wisdom , in the character development and - yes , redford fans - in the romance where it is most compelling . with his ruggedly handsome face that speaks of many never-to-be-told mysteries , redford is an actor for every generation . his little smile is guaranteed to win every heart in the audience in an instant . " saying it out loud is the hard part . " i fell head over heels in love with this powerful but subtle movie . and audiences may again become infatuated with the 61-year-old redford , proving that age makes no difference when it comes to love . it is rated pg-13 for one disturbing accident scene and would be fine for kids around 10 and up . 
1	carol reed's breakthrough film as a director after a long and undistinguished film career . are just trying to figure out what to do that is right . he does not care that he would only be healing johnny so that the fugitive could be executed . that only help given without expecting something from it , is truly a christian charity . londoner reed has shot a pro-british film , that is stronger on being a suspenseful art film than an accurately political one . the dark rainy streets of belfast and the brooding mood of mason , made this film look much like a noir feature . it is preachy in spots , trying to show many different sides to the struggle , where characters along the way seem more like symbols than real flesh-and-blood . but the film was very weak in setting up the political arguments that caused the civil war in the first place , as no rational person will disagree with the film's anti-violent stance . but there is a lot going on that the film left uncovered from the point of view of what the revolutionaries are protesting . i found the film , nevertheless , absorbing , especially as a thriller--a 'cops and robbers' tale . 
1	for viewers who think movies should be more like plotless imax films , director martin campbell provides a feast for your eyes in the 35mm motion picture , vertical limit . your brain will likely feel starved , but your thumbs will get lots of exercise as you twiddle them waiting for the inevitable disaster to strike so that the story can finally get some traction . their rapid deaths , of course , are done so that we can have as many dramatic incidents as possible . you don't go " wow " during an imax film for the dialog . you do so when the imax movie makes you experience some vicarious moment of terror . easily , the most ridiculous part of vertical limit is the proclivity of the characters to die for the greater good . for most people , the idea of suicide as a way to help someone else isn't something they could do easily or ever . except for their displays of physical strength , neither o'donnell nor tunney gives much to their parts . this isn't a movie that stands up to much logical examination . several of the film's sequences , while impressive , appear quite impossible . the only real acting of any merit in the movie comes from scott glenn , as toeless , recluse montgomery wick . surprisingly , only once does any climber , certainly not the indefatigable wick , resort to using bottled oxygen . although paxton appears to be having fun , he delivers one of his weakest performances . the party looks like a drinking scene from a generic teen comedy . gosh , isn't mountain climbing fun ? the story even includes a pair of australian stoner dude brothers , who like to sun themselves in the buff , but who are really k2-capable climbers . it's that kind of script . my personal favorite among the many ridiculous aspects of the movie is its ability to telegraph key twists with absolute precision . without any computers whatsoever , exactly what do you calculate would be the chance that a storm will come out of nowhere ? 100% ? with its sweeping music and sometimes stunning cinematography , the film does have its rewards . but if you're looking solely for visual thrills , go for a real imax film , not an ersatz substitute . vertical limit runs a long 2 : 06 . it is rated pg-13 for intense life/death situations and brief strong language and would be fine for kids around 12 and up . 
0	" we've got a problem ? " before an orchestra starts , it carefully establishes a reference tone . one of the biggest problems with town & country is that it never finds any consistent or successful tone . the result is a dreadful comedy that's as flat as a can of soda left open all night . the cello looks particularly happy . can't say that i blame it . but , i digress . he swears to himself to never yield to such temptation again , but he , of course , does not keep this vow . the visuals of a tipsy marilyn monroe frolicking in the snow with a horny polar bear is one of the few memorable or even mildly amusing parts of the production . ( the less said about charlton heston's embarrassing role as a mad , gun-toting father , the better . ) the film has reportedly been recut several times in order to find some version that works . the editors clearly stopped too soon . they could have used the confetti to celebrate something worthwhile like some better movie's release . it is rated r for sexuality and language and would be acceptable for most teenagers . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
0	it is difficult to fall in love with a material thing like a violin , except when it is played as beautifully as it is by solo violinist joshua bell , as esa-pekka salonen conducts the london philharmonia orchestra , playing john corigliano's score . its ill-conceived plot is so sloppily directed and trite , that it was a very trying experience just to try and figure out what the director was trying to say about the violin that made him think that this story was so mysterious and worth telling . each century is a primer for relating the current society's love for classical music compared to the love shown for it by the violin's creator . all the vignettes involving the violin changing hands in different countries made me cringe with embarrassment , as the tales were so devoid of any logic and so ridden with cliches , as to make them unintentionally laughable . what could this team of writer and director have been thinking about ? it is hard to believe that this is the same team that made the very pertinent and inspiring " thirty two short films about glenn gould . " the scenes in shanghai during mao tse-tung's cultural revolution , in which western culture is demonized and its books and musical instruments are unceremoniously tossed into a bonfire , are flatly and uninspiringly done . vignette left no lasting impression on me , except as a further illustration of how the story got the costumes right but distorted the historical events . that the film has lost all track of itself in these tedious vignettes , so much so that it has no chance of ever uncovering what it probably wanted to show , of how the universal message of music brings harmony to the world and how it transcends all cultures and kinds of people . if that was all he did , it would have been enough and perhaps the film could have ended with some dignity , and the music presented would have left a big enough impression so that the film could at least be worth seeing for that . but no ! for some unfathomable reason , we are supposed to get worked up about a bidding war for the violin and who would possess this perfect instrument when for the entire film there was not one person in the movie covered in enough depth that we could get emotionally involved with , and to care at this late date about who owns this material object , when it has long since been viewed as a mere trophy , just doesn't make sense . that the one who does walk away with the trophy , confirms my feeling that every judgment the director and writer made about this film was a wrong one . what makes this film seem worse than the usual hollywood blockbuster , a film that it is most imitative of , is that it is presented as a high-brow art film and will draw its audience from those who see such films , but it is done so pretentiously , lacking in any kind of subtle mannerisms and humor , that all it has to offer story wise is its superficial dialogue and pretty costumes . its high production costs to attain accuracy of story only resulted in a film of kitsch art . if you see it , it should be only for the wonderful solo violin of joshua bell . 
2	unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric . ostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning . many scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room . the cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) . despite violating nearly every rule of " legitimate " documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment . while it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi . this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he's funny , energetic , and eminently quotable . it's almost certainly different that anyone would imagine . on the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped . a variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color . there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience's perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences . nevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment . while unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear . overall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed . when the designer declares that " everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , " it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed . 
1	some interesting race-related points are raised , but van peebles disappoints by focusing instead on the standard elements of the picture . by the film's end , this has degenerated into little more than a 19th-century shoot-em-up . posse is a violent movie , but without the grittiness that characterized clint eastwood's academy award winning unforgiven . technically , this film is a mess . however , in posse , the editing is sub-par--scenes often come to jarring conclusions . the music at times seems better-suited to a contemporary action film than a western , and the quick changing of camera angles occasionally makes posse feel like something created for mtv . despite numerous problems , posse remains an entertaining film . in addition to bringing a refreshingly new perspective to the western , it tells a solid story . the subplot involving graham perhaps creates some unnecessary baggage , but the main conflict between van peebles and richard jordan in freemanville is well-developed . a comparison to glory is worth making . in many ways , the intentions of the two films are similar--both attempt to redress the historical inaccuracies of hollywood . however , where glory succeeds brilliantly by wedding the dramatic impact of the black man's role in the civil war with its overall tale , posse fails to attain the same level . with only a few minor script alterations and some re-casting , this could easily have been an all-white film . many of the most important and intriguing questions about the real roles of blacks in the old west are sadly left unexplored . posse serves merely to whet our appetites . even considering the limited success of the attempt , it's important that the effort was made , if for no other reason than that to open a few eyes and make some people aware of the bias of a white-written american history . posse also has enough entertainment value to make it worth a look , especially for those who enjoy westerns . it certainly isn't a definitive film , but it has its high points . 
1	this is a mark rappaport film , so if you are expecting to see a convential film , you have walked into the wrong theater . his tongue-in-cheek humor is as always , delightfully absurd . all 9 characters play co-starring roles , with no one dominating the film . and it works , in an odd sort of way , making the characters seem connected to each other from the opening strangulation scene until the last scene , even though there is no mention ever made in the movie again of the opening murder . this is a film about troubled characters and a chance for rappaport to direct his weird humor into the inanely funny lines spoken by them , as each character is out of it , in a neurotic way . the characters appear in short skits , trying to relate to each other in bursts of energy , spewing out lame jokes and theories , self-absorbed with their own neurotic tendencies , while many of them are hungering for sex and violence , and answers to puzzles that they may not even be working on . that should cover enough of the plot for any one who needs to know what he is seeing before he determines if he should venture out to rent this on video . all i could honestly say , is that i enjoyed it . it was like a nice cold drink , on a hot summer day , offering me something for my thirst , as i wonder why there is not a greater market for original films like this one , after all , the plot of this film is not completely insane . and as paul so ably says , " everything is a plot , it is just not clear what it is . " 
1	you've had a hard day , and the circuits in your brain have gone on overload . you know you should see the latest swedish film since it is full of angst and deep hidden meanings , but you got so depressed after the last message movie you saw that you couldn't sleep afterwards . you are too busy to see , much less smell the daisies . romance ? well , forget it . does any of this ring true for you ? then , i have a light hearted , fairy tale of a romance for you . there is not much in it , but what there is is a delight and will reaffirm your belief in life and especially in romance . don juan demarco asks the question what is reality and why do you care . is reality a bunch of messy old facts or can you adopt a wonderful fantasy and make it your reality through force of will ? is a firmly and completely believed fantasy more valid than mere facts ? he always wears a large hat , a mask , and clothes that his grandmother says makes him look like zorro . nobody can sweet talk women like he can . his handholding scene is the most erotic i have ever seen excepting only for the one in the age of innocence . don juan's life is fascinating . by the time , he reached sixteen , well , let's just say that many adventures awaited him . there is a lot to recommend this delightful bit of fluff , but let me get the bad news out of the way first . i am sorry to report that the great marlon brando has been kidnapped ! in his place , they have a much larger , quite mediocre , and very boring actor . although he does look like brando , he is clearly someone else . this clown makes you look at your watch every time the camera is on him . there is a lot wonderful about don juan demarco , but at the top is the marvelous performance by johnny depp . the words flow from his lips like butter . his screen presence was completely convincing . the script by jeremy leven is worthy of the brothers grimm . the cinematography by ralf d . bode and the set decoration of mexico is evocative of a romantic era of long ago . it has the feel of like water for chocolate . the natural and richly colorful sets and the warm glow of the filming makes happiness flow through all of your veins . the costumes by kirsten everberg are full of romance and love . finally , this was the first film in a while that has a musical score that i thought really adds to the ambiance . the director , jeremy leven , understood the mood he wanted to create and did it quite well . why he had to cast brando and dunaway , i will never fully understand . yes , i guess , he must have figured that they would add to the box office take , but when he saw the dailies , why didn't he change his mind and get some other actors ? oh well , . . . it is correctly rate pg-13 for two very brief nude scenes , a bloody and deadly sword fight , and a subtle love making scene with all of their clothes on . any kid older than 12 who is interested in romance would like it . i recommend it to you , and i award it * * 1/2 . as i said earlier , it had the potential for a much higher rating . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . 
2	alternative scale : cast : danny aiello , christine lahti , nancy travis director : christine lahti screenplay : polly platt based on the book by w . p . kinsella cinematography : marc reshovsky music : stewart levin u . s . distributor : to be shown on showtime lieberman in love , actor christine lahti's delightful directorial debut , won the 1996 oscar for best live action short . i can't say whether it was better than the other four nominees ( i haven't seen any of them ) , but , based solely on this film's merits , it's worthy of the honor . as romantic comedies go , this one is top-notch . in less than forty minutes , lieberman in love adds a few fresh twists to an old , often-exhausted genre . the only drawback is that , by the movie's end , you're left wanting more . lieberman in love probably has enough material to warrant a full-length feature . one problem , though -- she's married . working opposite aiello , lahti and travis are equally good . travis , who lights up the screen in a way that she hasn't since three men and a baby , exhibits an appealing vulnerability as the apparently- guileless object of joe's affection . lieberman in love is everything that this sort of film should be -- funny , romantic , and occasionally unpredictable . the movie won't be playing in any local multiplexes , but it is getting wide exposure at film festivals , and will air sometime in 1996 on the showtime tv network , which funded the project . whether you see it on the big screen or the small one , however , lieberman in love is worth searching out . 
1	the wilderness and the snowbound land are visually appealing , while the eskimos come across as a friendly people , easily given to smiling , even if some are suspicious of the white men , thinking of them to be useless as hunters . the filmmaker massot shows the filmmaker flaherty staging shots of eskimos building igloos , sleeping together , and lots of faked shots of eskimos doing things solely for the camera . but somehow the film works in a very human way and the thrill of seeing the eskimos live in such harsh conditions is something few westerners can readily comprehend or for that matter , have ever seen before . both films are distinguished for using the real intuits to play themselves . so much for hollywood and what it considers important . 
1	the 1948 version of the three musketeers is the exact sort of film most people have in mind when they call something a " costume drama , " usually implying sarcastically that the show is really all costume and no drama . his rendition of the three musketeers is one of his non-musical movies , but he cast a musical star , gene kelly , in the title role of d'artagnan . although you are convinced that the scene where kelly will either sing or dance is just around the corner , it never appears . the chief motivation to see this version is to marvel at the costumes by walter plunkett and to watch the sword fighting . it strains credulity to think of these as clothes to fight in , but at least they look magnificent . the women's gowns are even more outlandishly lavish . the wide spectrum of bright colors makes the show look like a test for a new film stock . if you are looking for a lightweight show where all of the actors have a blast making it , then look no further . this is it . the good guys are never in any real danger , and the bad are not particularly threatening . a great costume romp , and high camp too . no one takes his part seriously . the show appears cast for stars rather than roles . lana turner is haunting as milady de winter , and june allyson is radiantly lovely as constance bonacieux . price flubs such already ridiculous lines as , " when we think , our impulsive enemies are helpless . " one of the old time classic lines is athos's , " it's all for one , d'artagnan , and one for all . " van heflin takes this rousing anthem to bravery and camaraderie , and turns it into a trivial one , much like , " okay , let's go guys . " the music by herbert stothart borrows liberally from tchaikovsky , which makes for some romantic tunes . the colorful cinematography by robert h . planck takes full advantage of the splendor of the costumes . the sets by henry grace and edwin b . willis stick to dull grays and browns , all the better to set off the colors of the gowns . this version of the three musketeers is only one of many film versions of the novel by alexandre dumas . i suspect there is a better version , but it has been so long since i have seen the others , i cannot say this confidently . i remember liking the 1974 version with michael york , but that was twenty-two years ago , and i no longer remember precisely how good it was . it is not rated , but would be g . there is no sex , nudity , or profanity . the violence is fairly bloodless , and most people die by having the sword clearly thrust into the air under their armpits . my son jeffrey , age 7 1/2 , gives it a thumb almost up . he says the film is for kids 5 1/2 and up , and i agree . i give the show a mild thumbs up for mindless , swashbuckling fun , and i award it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	and the winner of the best picture that year , as well as well as seven other oscars , was gone with the wind . easily one of the best motion pictures ever made , it has been restored and released to the theaters . the print is clean and handsome , the digitally remastered sound is strong and clear and this time they are showing all of the movie . to make the movie look more modern , the last few times it has been released in wide-screen by chopping off the top and bottom . this time it is being distributed in the 4 : 3 aspect ratio of the original release . the epic motion picture is part romance , part history , part character study and part the world's most popular soap opera . our packed audience treated the film almost reverentially . as the fickle but resilient scarlett , vivien leigh gives a tour de force performance . " if i hear one more word about war , i'll run in the house and slam the door ! " her world of fancy balls and bbqs will not countenance any such intrusion , even if the first shots of the civil war have already been fired . the intense foreboding of this outwardly happy scene makes it arguably the movie's most moving . chips , has a ball playing rhett butler , the story's loveable rapscallion . with his hearty laugh and his sneer of a grin , rhett is a natural charmer without trying to be so . " we're bad lots , both of us - selfish and shrewd , " he tells her in a succinct summation of their characters . butterfly mcqueen is hilarious as the comically incompetent slave , prissy . ( " miss scarlett , i don't know nothing about birthing no babies ! " ) but it is hattie mcdaniel as mammy , scarlett's rock of gibraltar , who delivers the strongest performance as a slave and later a servant . hattie deservedly won the best supporting actress that year , beating out de havilland , whose performance was superlative . " you can do without a reputation . " ) the artistic aspects of the film's production are as stunning as its acting . the oscar-winning cinematography by ernest haller and ray rennahan added to the vastness of the picture . shooting outdoors with heavy emphasis on silhouettes set against rust-colored evening skies or orange-hued burning cities , they created a tableaux so expansive as to make audience's mouths drop . max steiner's nostalgic music , which lost the oscar to the even better score of the wizard of oz , is as moving as it is memorable . the only problem with the picture is that it could have used a little judicious pruning . the international travel sequences , for example , add little . gone with the wind is a picture deserving of a restoration every decade . see it , if you can , in a theater . in fact , see all of the classics , if you can , in a theatrical setting . television is fine , but classics deserve better for their full appreciation . it is rated g , but with its war violence and frightening images it is inappropriate for most kids under around 8 . and it may not hold any interest for kids under 10 or 11 . my son jeffrey , age 9 , was well behaved through a long movie that he hated . he found it boring and frightening and gave it only * ? . finally , he said that it should have been rated pg . 
0	" enigmatic , " robert replies . the problem with writer/director brian skeet's the weekend is that , to the extent that it is an enigma , it is not one worth solving . a slow , ponderous and pretentious film , it has a treacly score that fills every crevice of the set with melancholic solo piano and violin music . the actors move in something approximating slow motion , which only adds to the film's soporific effect . sweeney ) , the film provides very little for the actors to do other that deliver the speeches that go for dialog in the movie . ( " you silence the artist and you silence the most articulate voice the people have , " robert says , quoting oscar wilde . ) with the film's setting by a vast river , ron fortunato's stunning cinematography is the only consistently enjoyable part of the production . we have frequent flashbacks which show tony posturing and looking like a greek god . " if we expect nothing from our children and they expect nothing of us , no one will be disappointed , " she tells us as sort of her philosophy of life . in a bit of unintentional humor , the movie's most unrealistic scene occurs at a dinner when the two families get together for the first time . " biographies can make the most thrilling lives seem banal , " author laura says in a bit of self-deprecating criticism . and movies , like the weekend , can make potentially interesting topics dreadfully dull . it is not rated but would be an r for brief nudity , some sexuality and language and would be acceptable for teenagers . 
0	belle de jour is a classic french film from 1967 that has been out of release for a couple of decades . belle de jour is by the famous director luis bunuel and stars the equally famous catherine deneuve as severine sevigny . her bouts of prostitution again feature s & m which is attempted to be presented as great fun and very playful . for anyone wanting a more serious treatment of prostitution , they should see the excellent , albeit quite depressing , 1986 movie working girls by lizzie borden . i'll let you find out the rest of the story by seeing the movie . i found the story unbelievable and very dated . i know the critics are going gaga over its rerelease . i do not buy it . she looks pretty degraded and unhappy to me even though she does start to smile some toward the end of the film . i thought the performance of all the actors , most especially that of deneuve , was wooden . it was as if the director wanted more of a tableaux that a motion picture . to the fans of this show , i say they can have it , i want nothing of it . belle de jour runs 1 : 40 which , with its loose editing by louisette hautecoeur , keep making me want to shout " okay , lets get this scene moving . " it is in french , but the english subtitles are easy to follow . it is correctly rated r for sadomasochism . there is little sex and almost no nudity . it would be okay for mature teenagers . i do not recommend the show , but i do give it * 1/2 for attempting to be innovative in its time . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	keeping the faith is not a feature length version of the old joke about a priest and a rabbi walking into a bar . . . not exactly , anyway . the set-up finds director/co-star edward norton exploiting exactly that concept as his character -- new york catholic priest brian finn -- relates the film's story to an incredulous barkeep . there's a lot of ground to be covered in a romantic comedy that also introduces questions of faith , cultural and religious melting pots and balancing career and personal goals . and keeping the faith seems intent on covering every last square foot of it . screenwriter stuart blumberg dashes madly back and forth between themes , while norton dashes madly back and forth between tones ( how else to describe a sentimental romance that also includes slapstick dips in holy water fonts and the surreal inclusion of " heroes of the torah " trading cards ? ) . oh , and somewhere along the way they're supposed to fit in a love story . it's no wonder norton felt the need to have a lightweight film clock in at two hours plus . thank heaven that keeping the faith is often quite funny in its fragmented , scattershot way . blumberg's script is ripe with good dialogue , and a couple of solidly crafted set pieces ( including a jewish american princess date from hell ) . stiller continues to build a body of comic screen work that measures up to any of his contemporaries , giving zing to jake's self-deprecating manner . there are eye-catching bit parts , including ken leung in a very funny scene as a karaoke machine salesman . and there's jenna elfman , who has never particularly impressed me in the past except as a ball of energy . here she's a completely convincing object of desire ( even if norton lingers on her close-ups a bit too lovingly ) , luminous , intelligent and driven . as one part of a romantic pairing , she's a tough act to match . the match , as it turns out , becomes one of keeping the faith's bigger problems . the premise is sound enough , but stiller never looks comfortable as a romantic lead . in fact , there's more plausible chemistry between elfman and norton , and not just because both actors are blonde -- the pairing we're expected to root for just doesn't seem like a particularly good combination of personalities . how much more interesting -- and daring -- keeping the faith might have been if the film had suggested anna was merely sublimating her desire for brian with jake , making for much tougher choices at the film's conclusion . that's probably too much to ask from a film that , at its core , is a fairly fluffy hollywood confection . it's certainly a pleasant enough diversion , good for more than enough chuckles to make it worth a look , but it's surprisingly timid for a film that tries to cover so many thematic elements . it's also a lot warmer 'n' fuzzier than you'd expect from the cinematic equivalent of " a priest and a rabbi walk into a bar . . .

1	rush hour , regardless of what you may have read , is not a jackie chan movie . whereas it is true that jackie chan , one of the more engagingly delightful actors around , does appear in the movie , it is not the typical chan project to showcase his comedic brand of martial arts skills . director brett ratner , director of the widely-panned money talks , lacks much sense of action or comedic timing . rush hour drifts aimlessly for large portions , especially when chan isn't in the frame . the script by joel cohen and alec sokolow has some good laughs , but it isn't written nearly smart enough and frequently feels the need to sink to bad racial humor . people who haven't seen the talented chan in action may not be as disappointed as those who have become his fans . non-fans will undoubtedly enjoy the few times chan is allowed to cut loose , but those who have seen him at his best will likely be frustrated . chan's charms come as much from his sweet cherubic demeanor as his athletic skills and daring stunts . rush hour features chan as an untypically dour character whose seriousness gets in the way of his allure as an action hero with childlike innocence . philip baker hall and many other fine character actors are given nothing to do in the picture but collect a paycheck . viewers' degree of tolerance for tucker's brand of over-the-top , slapstick humor will be a major determinate of how much they like rush hour . at times he is extremely funny . most of the film plods along with the audience hoping that jackie will finally get some more screen time and be allowed to show off his skills . the only completely successful part of the film is the series of outtakes shown during the closing credits . but any film where the outtakes are dramatically better than the " intakes " is clearly in trouble . if the director had thrown out the script , left the set , and just filmed the characters ad-libbing , he would have had a superior product . it is rated pg-13 for violence and profanity and would be fine for kids around ten and up . 
1	this movie , which could just as easily be called the michael jordan worship show , plays like a 90-minute homage to his airness , selling his every virtue . by the end of this picture , jordan , whose status as a pop icon has never been in dispute , has been elevated to the level of a demi-god . it was inevitable that jordan would eventually get into the movies . space jam's problem isn't that jordan is the star , but that the tone is sickeningly reverential . there are only a few times when space jam dares to poke fun at its leading man , and , on those occasions , it does so gently . opportunities for satire exist , but pytka pulls nearly every punch . the bland results lead to a movie whose entertainment value is fine for kids , but marginal for adults . on the other hand , any movie that features the delightful looney tunes characters can't be all bad , and , indeed , the writing for bugs bunny and friends is as crisp as ever ( except when they're bowing and genuflecting before his airness ) . just about everyone from the warner brothers cartoon world is there , from bugs and daffy to foghorn leghorn and marvin the martian . there's even a new character , lola bunny , who gives bugs a love interest and adds a little sex appeal to the otherwise all-male cartoon character roster . i wish there had been more of these two -- they were always the funniest the looney tunes had to offer . the story , which would like to follow in the footsteps of the groundbreaking who framed roger rabbit ? , mixes live-action and animation . technically , the film isn't quite up to roger rabbit's standards , but it's a huge improvement over ralph bakshi's cool world , which mingled gabriel byrne and brad pitt with a bunch of sleazy cartoon creations . certainly , from a visual standpoint , there's nothing wrong with space jam . in fact , a few sequences are positively dazzling . there are a number of exceptionally clever moments in space jam , some of which are visual and some of which lie in the dialogue . several of these pass quickly or occur in the background , so it takes a keen eye to spot them . a couple of the better , more obvious ones include a nod to pulp fiction and a biting dig at disney . aside from jordan , the only human with any significant screen time is wayne knight , who plays an irritating baseball publicist . strangely , however , amidst all the two- dimensional cartoon characters , the flattest figure of all is jordan . the basketball star's power might be the drawing card for space jam , but the looney tunes group steals the spotlight -- at least as often as pytka will let them . 
1	highly predictable , certainly . funny ? well , i think it depends on the viewers . others , may be inclined to write off the show as a lame comedy . most reviewers have been in the latter category . let me convince parents of the film's authenticity . i have long since lost track of how many times this has happened to us . director michael hoffman uses fast paced songs and frequent cuts to a digital clock to maintain the film's high energy level . both pfeiffer and clooney are good looking actors and full of talent . " my face is on buses . " the smart script by terrel seltzer and ellen simon keeps the barbs flying . in a comedy , you have to give the material a lot of leeway . although i do not expect accuracy , the treatment of her son in the office was too far fetched . sometimes the hectic pace is broken by a dreamy musical interlude , and new york city itself sometimes becomes a visual relaxation point . for those of you who may have forgotten , there are many lovely sights there , and one fine day shows off several to maximum effect . while most are realistic , having them all occur in a single day is not , but in a movie it works . in another all-too-true-to-life scene , melanie tries to reassure sammy with , " you're the most important thing in the world . " what parents have not been cut to the quick by their children with a line like that ? the supporting cast is strong , and there is even a cute little kitten that jack gets to carry . the ending is superb . " let's do this right , " says melanie . " let me freshen up so i'll feel a little more like a woman and less like a dead mommy . " you will never guess how their date ends up . or then again , those of you who are parents may . it is rated just pg . there is no sex , nudity , or violence . there are a few mild but , nevertheless , needless profanities . my son jeffrey , age 7 1/2 , gave it a 99 percent thumbs up . he downgraded it slightly due to the kissing scene . ( he made me cover his eyes , but let him peak so he would not miss any of it . ) i'd raise the age to 6 and up , but i certainly recommend the picture to all parents of kids less than twelve . for others , i'm not so sure . i give the film * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	the woman in question is queen elizabeth i , and the movie , elizabeth , covers the time just before and after the 25-year-old woman is crowned queen . indian director shekhar kapur's vision of elizabeth is as a modern heroine , lover , and ruler . michael hirst's script advances that view by giving her dialog as fresh and bland as a modern novel . typical of the insipid lines , are elizabeth's statements , " i do not like wars . with the lovely and intelligent cate blanchett , from oscar and lucinda , cast as the lead , the movie bursts with potential . the largely wasted supporting cast includes shine's geoffrey rush , jude's christopher eccleston , stealing beauty's joseph fiennes , jurassic park's richard attenborough , colonel chabert's fanny ardant , shadowlands's edward hardwicke , and even sir john gielgud in a cameo as the pope . even with all of this promise , the film cries out for a one-word review : confusing . with lavish sets by john myhre , luxurious costumes by alexandra byrne , radiant cinematography by remi adefarasin and stirring music by david hirschfelder , the film is a treat for the eyes and the ears , except for the dialog . with the center speakers turned off , the movie would make a top-rated silent picture . the writer and director get the visuals perfect but have great difficulty in creating a coherent story . even those , like myself , who consider themselves students of english history will have trouble following the movie's details . filmed on the dark side , many of the characters , who look similar , dart in and out of scenes without ever establishing motivations for their actions . elizabeth's part is well developed , but the supporting cast all have underwritten roles . although the overall setup for the story is clear , i posit that if they were to have a pop quiz at end of the movie , most audiences would have trouble identifying the characters and explaining their roles . elizabeth is a lithe , stunning and levelheaded beauty . the rest of the movie has a swarm of supporting characters in a convoluted series of conspiratorial subplots . the machinations are as thick as they are confusing . to develop them into a comprehensible story , the filmmakers should either have added an extra hour to the film's length or eliminated some of them . do we really need a royal cross-dressing bisexual scene ? if writer hirst and director kapur are successful with this modern adaptation of the story of queen elizabeth i , the future possibilities are limitless and potentially appalling . hirst could give him some snappy dialog like , " hey brutus , what you doin' here ?

2	the quote that was foremost in my mind as i sat down to watch the fact-based rosewood came from director john singleton : " i am concerned about absolute historical accuracy to an extent , but i am really more worried about being truthful to the essence of what happened at rosewood . . . i am making a movie that people will respond to . " indeed , this motion picture , which combines the flavor of a john ford western with singleton's uniquely visceral power , is an epic that stands alone in the latter weeks of a dismal movie winter . neither came close to the impact of the director's first feature . despite an occasional narrative hiccup , this is a rich and moving motion picture . if singleton takes liberties with the historical account of what happened at rosewood ( and that account is murky at best -- the death count differs greatly depending on which source is being consulted ) , it's in the name of dramatic license , and it works . this is a deeply affecting tale about the naked emotional and physical devastation that can be wrought by racial hatred . but it is also a story of hope that highlights the indomitable nature of the human spirit and the fraternity that can bind together two apparently different people . rosewood does not glamorize evil , but neither does it demonize those who practice it . singleton is careful to present a balanced and believable picture of the participants on both sides . the result presents a forceful message without ever preaching . jon voight and ving rhames , both of whom appeared in last summer's blockbuster , mission impossible , lead an impressive cast . while both voight and rhames are exemplary , they are ably supported . and bruce mcgill portrays one of the most chillingly realistic crackers ever to appear on screen . his is a startling performance because he defies tradition by not going over-the-top . while rosewood must be seen as a cohesive whole to be fully appreciated , there are isolated moments that stand out because of their haunting power . one of the most startling depicts white folk picnicking and frolicking while rosewood burns in the background . there are , in fact , times when rosewood is reminiscent of schindler's list . there's a kernel of truth that both films have in common -- the theme of the duality of human nature : the capacity for great good and great evil , boundless love and infinite hatred . and , while this film is not as well-paced or tightly-structured as spielberg's holocaust drama , it evokes many of the same feelings and emotions . it is an important film that should not be missed . 
1	the telltale signs were all there . yes , you guessed it . in brian wayne peterson's script , which abides no subtle moments , megan's true sexual orientation is never left in question . director jamie babbit could use some of john waters's deft touch with comedy . the movie's satire is relegated to the visuals , with rachel kamerman's kitschy set decoration and alix l . friedberg's colorfully silly costumes providing almost all of the humor . the one-joke movie is cute but rarely funny . the first time we see the true direction outfits -- shocking pink for the girls and iridescent blue for the boys -- they are funny . but the uniform jokes quickly wear thin . the film's quality test , on which but i'm a cheerleader fails miserably , is what would the movie be like without the outlandish sets and costumes . the answer is that there wouldn't be much left . but i'm a cheerleader runs just 1 : 21 . it is rated r for strong language and sexual content involving teens and would be acceptable for high school seniors . 
2	a bottling plant can be a dangerous place if you're only a few inches tall . stuck in a milk bottle on its way down the assembly line to be filled , you are naturally consumed with terror . and it doesn't help if you're a little boy who hates milk anyway . borrowers are actually further divided into innies and outies , much like bellybuttons . innies are those borrowers that live inside your walls and under your floorboards . you've never seen them , of course , but when a sock seems to have disappeared from your drawer , it was probably a borrower who took it . among the film's many delights are gemma jackson's sets and marie france's costumes , both worthy of oscar consideration . the world as viewed from four inches high has never been more interesting and realistic , thanks to special effects that seem so natural . among the many little worlds created , the refrigerator is one of the best . why , to make climbing up easier . all of this is filmed by john fenner and trevor brooker with a rust colored cinematography that gives the picture a dreamy , nostalgic look . the screenplay by gavin scott and john kamps never makes the mistake so common today in kids' movies of setting the tone too dark . this is an imaginative environment where the borrowers creativity constantly saves the day . the movie teaches many a good lesson along the way . the serious father , who like all of the borrowers has a whimsically fun hairstyle , lectures his children on exactly what a borrower is . for those of you who liked the idea of tiny creatures living in walls battling a villain and an exterminator but hated mouse hunt , the borrowers is just picture for you . the ending , straight out of a brueghel painting , has a mass of borrowers so sweet that it may bring tears of joy to your eyes . " we're not creeps . and we're not pests . with the courage of a noble race , he explains that , " we may be small but heaven help anyone who thinks he might squish us . " it is rated pg for cartoonish violence and would be fine for kids four or five and up as well as adults with or without any kids . my son jeffrey , almost 9 , highly recommends the movie . his friend steven , age 9 , thought the movie was really funny . steven's twin john , obviously also 9 , thought it was a wonderful movie . 
1	director : wes craven . mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , adult themes ) running time : 118 minutes . it was a heartfelt appeal , and i was surprised to find the film evoking a heartfelt response . i responded passionately to the narrow-minded administrative mandates that , in times of budgetary constraint , describe the arts and music in public schools as " extra , " or not part of a " core curriculum . " and my heart was lightened at the sights and sounds of children making beautiful music . i'll willingly make the following admission , gentle readers : i found myself getting misty-eyed during music of the heart . i follow this admission with one of a different sort , the sort that makes viewers everywhere want to throttle critics within an inch of their thumb-turning , star-distributing lives : music of the heart , moving though it may be , just isn't a particularly good film . then those nasty budget cuts begin rearing their ugly head , forcing roberta to find creative funding solutions . there's no denying the fundamental emotional appeal of a story like this one . hollywood has always loved " inspirational teacher " films , and there have been plenty of them : the miracle worker ; to sir , with love ; conrack ; dead poets society ; stand and deliver ; lean on me ; mr . holland's opus ; dangerous minds ; etc . in recent years they have become even more prevalent -- perhaps indicative of how much more complicated teaching has become -- as well as more rigidly formulaic . the ultimate disappointment of music of the heart has little to do with its predictability ; on the contrary , like many films of its kind it hits its emotional high notes even though you know exactly where they're going to come . no , the disappointment in music of the heart comes from a strangely fragmented narrative that never quite commits to a central story . the film occasionally explores the juxtaposition of guaspari's background and that of her students , but the intrusions of social problems in the kids' lives are lurching and token pieces of " reality " -- a child of separated parents here , a victim of a drive-by shooting there , an instance of domestic abuse thrown in for good measure . when the story starts winding its way into guaspari's experiment with blind dating , you have to wonder if director wes craven has any sense for its focus . there's no question it was a pivotal moment in the history of guaspari's program , nor is there any question the carnegie hall benefit concert -- featuring big name performers like isaac stern , itzhak perlman and arnold steinhardt -- makes for a rousing finish . it just doesn't feel like part of the same film . stand and deliver reached its natural conclusion with the first successful ap exam ; music of the heart tags on a 45-minute coda after guaspari's first successful concert . of course there are several touching moments in that final 45 minutes , and throughout the film . unfortunately , however , it's the ideas alone that are touching , not the way the film presents them . it's easy to be moved by the sentiments expressed in streep and estefan's introductory clip . it's harder to be moved by a story that lets the mere concept of an " inspirational teacher " film do all the work . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
2	since time immemorial -- memorial day 1996 , to be precise -- one question has plagued movie-goers the world over : what might mission : impossible have looked like if someone had shown the faintest interest in telling a coherent story ? as answer , i give you ronin , an international espionage thriller fueled by as much brain power as adrenaline . the comparison to mission : impossible is almost too easy , especially given the presence of jean reno in both casts , but it's a telling comparison nonetheless . ronin shows how much more effective a film can be when set pieces are connected by ideas . as the operation begins , alliances quickly shift with the prevailing winds , no lofty ideal more important than the exigencies of the moment . that notion both drives the film and provides its title . mission : impossible flirted with the same concept , but it was to turn characters into vengeance-driven super-villains . the characters are sketched in only the most basic terms , in keeping with their private natures , yet they are given presence by actors like deniro and reno bringing mournful weight to their performances . though few words are spoken in the script by j . d . zeik and richard weisz ( a . k . a . david mamet ) , the very lack of human interaction between the characters speaks volumes . for a fairly introspective film , ronin is also a fairly exciting one . director john frankenheimer goes to the car chase well perhaps once too often , but those he uses are tense and well-constructed . the action level is as high in ronin as it has been in any summer blockbuster of the last few years , and it's _better_ action , more white-knuckle gripping than whoop-it-up flashy . for some viewers , that may be reason enough to spend two hours at the movies , but it's all the more impressive because the action serves the story . every subsequent violent encounter raises the stakes in this chaotic world , while it's always clear that the combatants neither know nor care what they're fighting for . ronin certainly has its share of jagged edges , notably the aforementioned opening titles and a distracting romantic sub-plot between deniro and mcelhone . some may find the characters too remote and under-developed , and consequently find it difficult to invest emotionally in the story . i found the chilly isolation of the characters exactly what ineeded to become emotionally invested ; the emptiness of their lives and actions _is_ the hook . this isn't earth-shaking profundity we're talking about , merely the building blocks of effective drama -- the visceral coupled with the intellectual , actions with consequences . consequences were never really an issue in mission : impossible , which makes it that much easier to appreciate what ronin has to offer . it's no longer a james bond landscape of world domination . for once , evil in an espionage thriller isn't what people do , but why they do it . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " .

0	if you've seen the trailers for disney's rocket man that have been bombarding the airwaves lately , you've probably reasoned with yourself that the film cannot possibly be as bad as it looks . actually , it's worse . some movies are so stupid they are good -- the most recent example being disney's george of the jungle . rocket man , on the other hand , starring harland williams as pee herman without the charm , remains insufferably inane . if harland williams possesses any comedic talent , it is not in evidence in this lame farce . only his imitations of old movie stars demonstrate any acting ability . " that's not possible . i programmed it myself .

0	screenplay : richard stanley , ron hutchinson . director : john frankenheimer . sounds like the making of apocalypse now , right down to the presence of brando . the end result . moreau is just a nightmare . moreau is based has been committed to film twice before , in 1933 and 1977 , and naturally this version tries very hard to convince us that there is a compelling reason to do it again , and important themes the other versions failed to uncover . the great revelation in the script ( credited to hutchinson and erstwhile director stanley ) is -- get this -- that humans are actually quite animalistic themselves . this bit of wisdom worth of the burning bush is delivered scattershot -- a piece here in the split-second intro which finds a pair of thewlis' fellow survivors throwing themselves to a conveniently circling shark in a fight over water , a piece there in a montage of documentary footage you expect to be underscored by " imagine . " it's all spectacularly sloppy , but it's hard to know whom to blame . stanley might have wanted to do a cerebral observation on violence and/or religion , but frankenheimer seems to want a good old thriller , and the two angles are not at all complementary . somebody cut this film to ribbons trying to find a point to it all , resulting in a giddy incomprehensibility . exactly what was douglas' role in moreau's experiments supposed to be , anyway ? moreau just keeps staggering forward and swinging wildly , like an overweight boxer without the faintest glimmer of strategy . speaking of overweight . . . oh , but that's far too easy . it would be too simple to observe that when brando makes his first appearance , covered in heavy white makeup and a white muu-muu the size of a circus tent , he looks like nothing so much as the michelin man on safari . it's too simple and somewhat unfair , because even under the burden of all that weight and a ridiculous accent , there is still something compelling about brando on screen . his moreau is what richard attenborough should have been trying to go for as hammond in jurassic park , a pleasant enough chap with a monstrous god complex . val kilmer , who is said to have quite a god complex in real life , seems to have decided to act in a completely different film , one which is much more fun . his montgomery is a casually nasty pot-head , but at least he is entertaining to watch , particularly when he does his dead-on brando impression . and poor david thewlis , whose character has no common sense and no particular reason for being a u . n . peace negotiator ( you'd think that might have been a useful subtext to the war which breaks out on the island ) , tries to look frightened by more than the lack of direction in the film , with little success . but this is a badly fragmented piece of work which manages to achieve tedium in only 96 minutes . perhaps some day they will make a documentary about the making of the film , like they did with apocalypse now in hearts of darkness . then maybe it won't have been a total loss .

2	a thoroughly enjoyable film about a pitiless serial killer of middle-aged women , that is played for laughs at the expense of the women victims . it is a black comedy , acclaimed for its stellar performances , especially by rod steiger as christopher gill , the psychologically warped killer , with a severe mother fixation , who uses a number of disguises to commit the murders and performs the murders as if he was on-stage , being only natural , considering that he is an accomplished broadway actor and well-known theater owner , and the son of a great actress . this presents an interesting contrast with the way the killer handles his neuroses . his performance is endearing and heckart's is amusingly right on target . she is delightfully refreshing , offering her beauty , sensitivity , and comedy in a splendid performance . this is an actor's film and they all make the most of it . steiger calls him the next day and offers to become segal's telephone confidant , but tells him , " remember , i am smarter than you are . " it was difficult not to find this witty film funny and its romantic subplot equally charming . 
1	stephen daldry's billy elliot , originally titled dancer , can be thought of as an english working-class version of flashdance but without any of the latter's glitz and production numbers . and , of course , its surroundings will remind viewers of the setting for the full monty . the problem with the movie's choreography is that billy , as he hams it up dancing and jumping around , is so awkward that it's hard for us to recognize the abilities that his teacher sees . moreover , his prancing around , which makes up large portions of the story , isn't that compelling . it's rather like watching your neighbor's kids hamming it up in the living room . most of the picture has the boy leaping about joyously but stiffly . these are heartfelt moments but not particularly convincing ones . set in a dirt-poor area of county durham in northern england in 1984 , the accents are so thick that you could cut them with a knife and so unintelligible at times that you'll wish that the picture had subtitles . the authentic dialog features the f-word in just about every sentence . it's a depressing tale with the inevitable light at the end of the tunnel , which is another of the film's problems . no matter how depressingly bleak the situation , the story follows too predictable an arc . the widower father is a completely angry caricature until , late in the picture , he makes the miraculous conversion that you can see coming a mile away . the supporting characters are little more than stick figures , which leaves the boy alone to carry the movie . the young actor does his best , and , whereas we certainly root for his character , the movie is just too formulaic to be able to recommend it . it is rated r for language and would be acceptable for teenagers . my son jeffrey , age 11 , didn't like much about the movie and gave it * 1/2 . he found the dialog hard to follow and felt the story got strained at several points . 
1	their latest offering is something called china moon , a film noir featuring the unlikely pairing of ed harris with madeleine stowe . this movie , which bears a 1991 date , is not like a fine wine--age has not improved it ( in fact , in the three-plus years since it was filmed , ms . stowe has gone to some lengths to distance herself from the production ) . after exchanging a few bad lines of dialogue , rachael and kyle recognize the attraction , although they don't act on it--at least not immediately . as far as thrillers go , this one starts off dead in the water . the first forty minutes are not only dull , but dull in a manner that calls attention to the bad dialogue and obvious plot points . there are instances when the relevance of some little detail is called attention to by everything except a big neon sign saying : " look ! the second half of china moon almost redeems the first . despite numerous coincidences designed to stretch one's suspension of disbelief to the breaking point , and several truly dumb plot contrivances , it's actually fun to follow all the twists and turns--even if too many of them are predictable . the ending , which displays a willingness to try something a little different , is another source of potential forgiveness . then there are the actors . if you don't listen to 75% of the dialogue ( which sounds like it was written by a seventh-grader hooked on dime-store potboilers ) , the two leads give enjoyable performances . ed harris is generally convincing , as is madeleine stowe , although it should be pointed out that neither role demands a great deal of range . these are pretty much single-dimension performances : the strong , silent detective and the scared , abused wife . on the other hand , the supporting cast doesn't have a clue . charles dance gets into his role as the detestable husband , never once eliciting a glimmer of sympathy from the audience , but his performance seems almost clinical--a sort of act-by-numbers job with a very , very bad southern accent . benicio del toro is absolutely dreadful , and almost every scene that he's in turns into an endurance contest for those watching . basically , for anyone who just wants to see a truly convoluted thriller without considering the logic or intelligence of the serpentine track of the story , china moon isn't a terrible choice . the film is good only by b-movie standards , and as such it offers something in the way of lowbrow entertainment . enjoyability depends largely on how deeply the viewer can immerse him- or herself in the movie's murky waters--something that's an iffy prospect with the combination of mr . del toro's acting and screenwriter roy carlson's often-inane script . 
1	cast : wesley snipes , diane lane , dennis miller , daniel benzali , alan alda , ronny cox director : dwight little producers : arnold kopelson , arnon milchan screenplay : wayne beach & david hodgin cinematography : steven bernstein music : christopher young u . s . distributor : warner brothers who said americans are cynical about the presidency ? murder at 1600 isn't the worst of the trio ( that dubious honor goes to shadow conspiracy ) , but it is easily the most preposterous . there's hardly a single aspect of this motion picture that seems more than superficially credible , and if the united states government is really run in the keystone cops manner depicted in wayne beach and david hodgin's script , then this country is in a great deal more trouble than anyone suspects . while there isn't much that director dwight little can do about the lack of intelligence in the storyline , he attempts ( with varying success ) to make up for this deficiency by generating a degree of tension during some of the otherwise-routine action sequences . and , although there's little doubt regarding the film's ultimate resolution , there is at least some suspense about exactly how it comes about . hollywood should be able to generate a more compelling picture with such a promising premise . perhaps murder at 1600's greatest flaw is that it's so ordinary . there's nothing new here : we have the maverick cop risking everything by taking on the system so that a killer can be brought to justice . along the way , there are the requisite chases , fights , and shoot-outs , but nothing in this film , from beginning to end , sets itself apart as even slightly memorable . the subject matter , if not the presidency , deserves more respect . wesley snipes is pleasant as usual , but this role could hardly be described as a challenge . diane lane fails to bring much emotion or appeal to the thankless role of snipes' female sidekick . despite displaying more energy than lane , dennis miller ( as regis' partner ) has less screen time . and alan alda , last seen traipsing through woody allen's everyone says i love you , adds another less-than-sterling entry to his underwhelming recent resume . it's apparent that murder at 1600 underwent some fairly heavy re- editing shortly before its release . not only are there some jarring transitions and conspicuous plot holes , but a number of scenes featured heavily during the theatrical previews ( including regis uttering the momentous line : " 1600 pennsylvania avenue -- an address that changes all the rules " ) have been excised from the final print . not having seen the original cut , i can't say whether these changes have helped murder at 1600 . regardless of their impact , however , the result is nothing for any of the participants to be overly proud of . 
2	australia , 1996 running length : 1 : 35 mpaa classification : no mpaa /97 , & 5/7/97 although the names and details had been changed , much of what made miles special remained . consider it shine 2 , if you want , although it was developed at the same time ( not after ) its higher-profile counterpart . those who appreciated scott hicks' oscar-nominated chronicle of david helfgott's life will certainly find something to like about lilian's story . if you were among shine's detractors , however , you would do best to stay away from this movie . although it contains many of the same themes , ideas , and narrative points , it isn't as well-acted , well-directed , or well- written . lilian's story is a competent , occasionally-moving tale , but it's not on shine's level . this is not the best , nor is it the worst , but it lacks the freshness and urgency associated with shine and angel baby . the point- of-view is somewhat different -- director jerzy domaradzki , polish born and schooled , views this story from an outsider's perspective , which places a little distance between the audience and the subject . while lilian's story is competently acted , every performer is a notch below their counterpart in shine . ruth cracknell is wonderful , but she's not quite on the same level as geoffrey rush . toni collette's bold performance is a shade less dynamic than noah taylor's . what's more , lilian's story doesn't envelop the viewer in the same way that shine did . there's an intensity missing here that shine possessed . that said , however , lilian's story is still a fine motion picture , and it has the guts and determination to visit unpleasant subjects that many movies still regard as taboo . lilian's story tells of an unorthodox triumph over adversity , but there are no bells and whistles indicating " feel good ending " at the conclusion -- it's a little more subtle than that . two comments made by lilian sum up the movie . the first , " at least [my life] wasn't mediocre , " illustrates lilian's character and determination . the second , " any tale is real if told well enough , " is a fair statement to make about this motion picture . 
0	entitled barney's great adventure , the picture , about following a magical egg , keeps its plot to a minimum . marketed sometimes as barney's great adventure : the movie , it would more aptly have been labeled barney's great adventure : the sing-along . the little ones , who would be happy to watch barney sing the phone book , will probably like the movie , which delivers large doses of their favorite overstuffed dinosaur . those hoping for more than just a long , outdoor version of barney's tv show , they will likely be disappointed . for a film aimed at the 2-7 year old set , the decision to cast child actors all around 10-years-old seems surprising and inappropriate . there is a one-year-old who has a few scenes , but most of the movie features these three older kids and barney . " you'll have scenery to look at . " thanks to a little water , the girls' toy barney turns into a real-life one , who sings and dances various short numbers . cody thinks he's way too cool for barney , but - surprise - by the end of the movie , he will be hugging him and singing-along too . even allowing for the lack of a real script , the actors demonstrate very little acting talent . with the humans getting more screen time than barney , their weakness drags down the movie considerably . and then there's the overall look of the picture . as filmed by sandi sissel , normally a television cinematographer , the multicolored sets look flat and dull . only in the magical scene of the host of hot-air balloons does sissel rise above the drab . the movie does have its silly , little delights . barney's great adventure runs just 1 : 15 . it is rated g and is appropriate for all ages . my son jeffrey , almost 9 , said that at his age he " kind of liked " the movie , but that he suspected younger kids would like it . jeffrey's biggest complaint was that there were way too many songs . 
1	producers : robert michael geisler & john roberdeau and grant hill . director : terrence malick . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , brief nudity , adult themes ) running time : 168 minutes . the announcement that the thin red line would mark terrence malick's return to the director's chair after a twenty year absence was greeted as the cinematic equivalent of j . d . salinger popping open his smith-corona to give it another go . this was , after all , the hermit-genius of great american movie-making , whose only two previous films -- badlands and days of heaven -- were spoken of in tones of reverence . yet try as i might , i couldn't work up the same enthusiasm . as adept as malick was at crafting stunning visuals , narrative seemed to be an afterthought to him , something to be cobbled together with voice-over narration . good films , yes , and profoundly beautiful ones , but not profound ones . malick reaches for profundity once again in the thin red line ; the result is another good , great-looking tone poem where deep thoughts stand in the way of genuine drama . it's instantly clear that malick intends to take the thin red line in a very different direction from jones' novel . jones , while he frequently found his way into the heads of his characters , was equally concerned with providing a vivid sense of the physical -- the oppressive heat and humidity , the boots full of water , and the insect attacks that challenged the men on guadalcanal before a single shot was fired . for long stretches of the thin red line , malick seems to forget that these characters have bodies at all . the incessant koan-like philosophizing becomes aggravating enough , but it's even more frustrating that every one of the men , from the law school-educated staros to kentucky-bred farm boy witt , thinks in the same college-sophomore-on-a- double-bong-hit , my-fingernail-could-be-a-whole-nother-universe terms . with only a couple of notable exceptions -- bell's obsessive love for his wife , and tall's careerist self-loathing -- malick's internal monologues turn the characters into an indistinct jumble of existential angst . ironically , the thin red line is at its best when it does get down and dirty , following the company's assault on a well-defended japanese hill position . it's a superb piece of kinetic war film-making , the camera bursting through tall grass as soldiers are cut down during a suicidal head-on attack . there's more poetry and insight as the men discover what battle will make of them than there is in an hour's worth of navel-gazing and heavy-handed juxtapositions of war ( " bad " ) and nature ( " good " ) . there's little question that the thin red line is an aesthetic wonder , shot by john toll in fickle available light and edited into a wartime koyaanisqatsi . and it all might have worked much better if malick had let viewers draw their own messages from the images , rather than letting a soldier inform us that " war don't ennoble men . . . it even that tactic might have worked better if the voices had been distinctive , or if there were some exploration of esprit de corps which connected these men to one another . each character in the thin red line is living too squarely inside his own head to connect much with anyone else . that sentiment applies to terrence malick as well , who returns from his two decade sabbatical for three hours of stunningly photographed , overwrought introspection . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
1	probably the best of the charlie chan's starring the swedish born warner oland in the feature role . this film is distinguished by oscar levant creating an opera for it called carnival and william kernell doing the libretto . charlie is played with a subtle grace and aplomb by oland , giving the film its life-force . the film had a convincing atmosphere and style about it , and it had the peerless boris doing his chilling loony thing with great relish . but let's forget the story , this film is fun in an old-fashioned way , and it's many pearls of wisdom that come forth , such as charlie explaining how a madman and a genius are sometimes similar because they both live in a world created by their ego . now how can you beat that for hollywood's oriental-style of profundity ! 
1	director : andrew davis . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 110 minutes . you'll be seeing ads for a perfect murder trumpeting " from the director of the fugitive , " which should set off a few alarms . if you're inclined to do the math , you'll note that the fugitive came out five years ago , and you might reasonably wonder what mr . davis has been up to in the interrim . the answer is two films warner bros . is hoping everyone has long forgotten : the bloated , laughless caper comedy steal big , steal little and the bloated , lifeless action film chain reaction . those films too were advertised as " from the director of the fugitive , " only the director of the fugitive never showed up . could davis finally display the film-making skill which once held viewers on the edge of their seats , but seems to have been in hibernation for half a decade ? i'm pleased to note that davis directs a perfect murder with much more of the style and savvy which characterized the fugitive . too bad the script is such a mess . douglas in particular gives the material a welcome edge , pitching tart dialogue with a superior sneer and making it supremely satisfying to watch his plans go awry . davis' production team , including production designer philip rosenberg and cinematographer dariusz wolski , creates an appropriately gothic atmosphere to complement tautly-directed individual sequences . all these elements are crafted by davis into a satisfying package likely to keep you intrigued as long as your watching . watch out for the drive home , though , when the whole thing may fall apart in your head so fast you'll lose sight of the road . on the one hand , a perfect murder contains as many metaphorically unfired guns as any film in the history of post-chekhovian drama . why doesn't it matter that emily is multi-lingual ? why is one character left conspicuously wounded-but-not-necessarily-dead , never to appear again ? on the other hand , it underlines some of its key plot points so blatantly ( insert lingering close-up of meat thermometer here ) that it's more than vaguely insulting , then drops key clues into the narrative from out of nowhere . add to that a story which dumps intellectual gamesmanship for struggles over a gun , and it's no wonder the film went back before the cameras for 11th-hour re-shoots of its final scenes . i suppose it's a credit to how much davis does right that a perfect murder still pushes plenty of the right buttons until the anti-climactic climax . if a director is lucky , he gets a good script he can make even better with stylistic choices . on other occasions , the best he can do is apply makeup to all the blemishes . between the film's mood and its solid performances , a perfect murder is about as strong a film as you can make from such feeble material . it may not be redemption for " the director of the fugitive , " but it sure is a step in the right direction . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
1	sometimes it is a single strategic mistake that is a movie's downfall . so it is with disney's live action remake of their 1961 classic one hundred and one dalmatians . this time they call it simply 101 dalmatians , and this time they simply forget the part that made the original work -- the dogs' story . the live action version stars people who have dogs . the cartoon version is clear who is in charge , and it is not the humans . in the original the animals refer to the people as their pets . in the animated version the dogs are the stars . most important of all is that the charm of the original came from the dogs' conversations , not the people's . in an era of talking animal pictures both good ( babe ) and bad ( gordy ) , there is no reason why the disney remake could not have given these pups a voice . in the cartoon there are many unique types , but in the new version they do little more than give the dogs names . even given the mistakes in its creation and its lack of effective direction by stephen herek , there is still much to admire in the picture . hands down , the best part of the film is glenn close's near perfect performance as that archfiend cruella de vil . close has a blast giving an outlandish rendition of a heinous fiend . suffice it to say that she would make the top of any animal rights group's hate list . i worship fur . " when cruella speaks , it is frequently accompanied by thunder and lighting so that you do not miss the point of how wicked she is . hughes does not know the word subtle . you may remember him from his first two home alone films , and i am sorry to report that there will be a home alone 3 . no boring old author as in the original . they provide little more than window dressing to cruella and the pups . one problem with the remake is that you really need to have seen and remember the original to appreciate the nuances of the story . this is particularly true of " the barking chain , " which is carefully explained in the cartoon but just happens in the live action version . the biggest disappointment to me is the scene where the puppies watch television . that is a long and precious scene in the original . the remake has only a vastly truncated and lifeless reenactment . i am not going to bother outlining any more of the plot . if you want to know more of the story line , you can read my review of the original that i wrote precisely 101 days before the opening tonight of the remake . there are some technical aspects worth mentioning . the set designs by assheton gorton are imaginative , particularly the ending scene , which is adorable on many counts . michael kamen's music is full of energy and bristling with adventure . adrian biddle's cinematography is bland indoors , but outside his blue gray snow images are lovely and evocative of what the picture should have been . the makers of 101 dalmatians connected all the dots , but did they weave a compelling story ? i think not . although there were some nice dog shots , the show is devoid of life save cruella's villainy . a picture more tedious than charming . skip this one and rent the original . some theaters are showing a short cartoon with it , but ours did not . the picture is rated g and would be fine for kids of any age . there is one scene where cruella is slashing at a hay stack with a pitchfork in a futile attempt to stab a puppy , but our audience of little ones did not seem frighten by it . other than that , there is no violence , sex , nudity , or bad language . i could have done without the scene of a puppy peeing on cruella's picture to demonstrate his hatred of her . my son jeffrey ( age 7 1/2 ) gives the show a thumbs up , but he remained inanimate during most of the movie . i give the movie a mild thumbs down and rate it * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	screenplay : susan minot . director : bernardo bertolucci . this is a film of false starts , dead ends and pointless distractions which pays too little attention to what should be its central premise . most of them are given some kind of romantic sub-plot -- just enough , in fact , to be genuinely annoying . bertolucci repeatedly cuts away in the middle of a scene to an irrelevant tangent , or introduces characters for a few superfluous moments . it is as though he is afraid that with all the drinking , dancing and baring of breasts going on , we in the audience will forget that there are also serious issues to be addressed . the problem is that it is always clear which of lucy's two missions is of greater interest to him , to the other characters in the film , and probably to us . there's nothing wrong with a simple , erotic coming-of-age story , but bertolucci appears to be embarrassed at the thought of making a film which is about something as base as the loss of virginity . it's truly a shame that bertolucci was unwilling to focus on that one story , because it provides a few touching moments . there are moments like that when lucy is every bit as beguiling as everyone in stealing beauty seems convinced that she is , but bertolucci still carries on as though he is above it all . he also makes that voyeuristic opening video sequence all the more telling . 
2	a stylish piece of film noir , it has exasperatingly slow pacing but devilishly demented characters and a wonderfully wicked , labyrinthine plot . characters die , or do they ? the coen brothers make interesting movies . most people know their most famous picture , the oscar winning fargo , but even the brother's failures ( the hudsucker proxy for example ) contain large flashes of brilliance . they claim to have taken out some of the boring parts and added in a bit as well . but the running time is about the same and the movie seems little changed with the exception of a hilarious introduction . the print is clean and the sound sharp . as the movie opens , a supercilious film preservation expert in his library pauses in his reading and pipe smoking to provide us a little history about the film . he explains that the movie was a tremendous success and started the entire indie craze . after this delicious bit of satire , the director's cut segues nicely into the original story . " not really , " meurice replies . the intriguing script is much better than the directing , and one is left with a strong wish that the coen brothers had done a much more meticulous job of excising the boring parts in this director's cut . still , it is a fascinating little tale and amply demonstrates the talent of these filmmakers . ( for a little extra fun , listen carefully and see if you can recognize the female voice on marty's answering machine . it's an uncredited role , and the actress does not appear in the movie . ) blood simple runs a remarkably slow 1 : 37 . it is rated r for violence and would be acceptable for most teenagers . ( there is only a single scene that will have viewers squirming . ) 
0	pop quiz : what does book of shadows : blair witch 2 , the sequel to that indie smash hit the blair witch project , have in common with its ancestor ? but this time all they get are producers' credits , which they may want to see removed from this turkey . this time director joe berlinger , working from an obtuse script by dick beebe , joe berlinger , jon bokenkamp and neal stevens , creates a movie that so hard to follow that you'll be happy that it gives you no reason to care that you're confused . i wasn't a fan of the blair witch project , but it is a cinematic masterpiece of originality compared to its sequel , which is a bad example of a teen slasher flick . fright in book of shadows comes only from sudden loud noises . the episodes of sliced human flesh and spurting blood are gross , not scary . the basic premise this time is that a bunch of kids sign up on the blair witch project web site -- a movie that plugs it's own web site has a lot of gall -- to take a tour into the woods to look for the witch . while hanging out amongst the trees , the kids babble incoherent and perfectly ridiculous lines . " i think you're being a monomaniacal reductionist ! " i don't know about you , but that would sure shut me up . ( although they might more precisely be referred to as " young adults , " the characters are so juvenile that i will continue to refer to them as " kids " in the review . ) when the movie isn't trying , without success , to terrify us , it tries with even less success to amuse us with its self-deprecating humor . " video never lies ; film does , " says another . the sequel , you see , is done on film whereas the original was done on video with a motion-sickness inducing shakicam , so they are poking fun at their own movie . funny huh ? not really . the kids do find one flaw in the original movie that the film critics missed . ah , from the mouths of babes , . . . book of shadows : blair witch 2 runs just 1 : 30 , but you'll swear it was longer . it is rated r for violence , language , sexuality and drug use and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
2	winstanley is a truly amazing and painstaking account of misery , as it depicts those whose cause is righteous and nonviolent . the narrative is taken from the pamphlet writings of gerrard winstanley , a gentle , christian radical . he sort of resembles a hippie of the 1970s . the film is based on the book by david caute , " comrade jacob , " but has been thoroughly reworked by co-directors brownlow and mollo . his unique filming style , his penchant for austerity , his demand for authenticity , his equalizing of all scenes in importance so that no event sticks out from the others , and his inspired devotion toward looking at the past , perhaps hoping to unearth some missing piece in the puzzle of mankind that keeps the modern world from advancing on the past tragedies , gives this film an air of adventure . lacking the necessary dramatics of films that are more accessible to the general public , this film is nonetheless a work of great intrigue and visual beauty . despite being filmed without the benefit of professional actors , the only professional being jerome willis who played general fairfax , this film has a certain solemnity about it that forces its truths to be seen in the face of the actors . it is brownlow's way of filming such misery , a way that records the diggers' sufferings as if it were the official record of what happened , and probably could pass for what is official . this sense of reality is what gives the film its raw power . it's a lesson in history that is re-created from the words of a journal that allows the directors to look back at the past with a sense of reverence . this film acts as a vehicle to understand what the diggers believed and how they lived , and how they justly thought that the earth was made common property for everyone . that everyone born on earth shall be fed by it and that all are equals in the creation . his performance was beautiful . there is no question , this low budget project , the bfi put up seventeen thousand pounds , achieved the maximum in having an authentic look , even showing the rare breeds of animals , of the time . it showed breeds of pigs and chickens that don't exist today but did during the 17th century . the film's cost is about the same as a james bond film's title scene would cost . the film's cinematographer , ernest vincze , like almost everyone in the film , including the directors , worked for nothing . it doesn't pretend to have the answers , but the questions it raises about the ability of mankind to live and work together , is one worth asking . the message of the film might seem naive or confrontational to many , including the marxists , the bourgeoisie , the film critics looking for a more recognizable kind of film to evaluate , and the common man , bored by what he doesn't want to know . but to others , perhaps the more restless in society , not afraid of ideas , there is a freshness in this work that you can't easily shrug off by pointing to the filmmaker's refusal to be more melodramatic . the scenes were acted with conviction and its lack of hollywood type of poshness actually played to its favor , making the action seem more pertinent . their story is not something you can easily forget in the black-and- white framed shots , taken by a hand-held camera , and in their uncompromising idealism squaring off against self-righteous forces that wanted to crush them , afraid of their new visions for mankind . try comparing winstanley to other period films of the commercial variety , and it is hard not to see how much more real and meaningful this film is . if nothing else , at least , it is a hard film to forget . for the poetic dream of winstanley , for an equitable and more reasonable world , one that is not forged by malice and greed : that is a vision the world is still waiting to see actually happen . this film is available on video by milestone . 
2	for me one of these is eraser . i went to it expecting an enjoyable schwarzenegger action flick , but nothing special . once safely ensconced in my seat i was blown away by the movie . thanks to an excellent script by tony puryear and walon green , the movie is the funniest action picture this year . director chuck russell ( the mask ) is able to sustain a high energy pace that keeps the action moving and the audience's adrenaline pumping . too bad he was not the director of the too often tedious mission : impossible . actually there is a center part of eraser that repeats part of mission : impossible , but with much more energetic timing . first , a suggestion . go see this movie while it is still at the biggest screen with the most powerful subwoofers . the explosions and the gun fire , especially the electromagnetic guns , produce a sound that has the theater rocking . second , the setup for the plot is the usual implausible one of the military , the intelligence community , the mafia , big business , et . al . ignore this conspiracy ridiculousness . the slight mystery is which guys are the good ones and which the bad . the ending of eraser is great . moreover , as soon as you think it is over , it gets better and better . the script is intelligent and at the same time so funny in parts that i was constantly rolling with laugher . i prefer rich . " the acting is quite good . arnold is in fine form and hilarious - as good as in true lies , which i loved . caan is given a one dimensional character but manages to make him interesting . coburn barely has a part - not enough to even comment on . the best acting in the show is by vanessa williams . in the first scene she is so tense , you feel like you are going to have a heart attack . all of this notwithstanding , this is arnold's picture , and he is great - strong and funny . there are many terrific minor actors in the show , but the best are the ones from the local mob-cum-union . they give invaluable help to kruger and wonderful mirth to the audience . the stunts are spectacular throughout , but my favorites are the scene when cullen's house is attacked and the scene on the airplane . the script too is highly imaginative from the guns used to the solutions kruger comes up with on the airplane . finally , the film conclusively answers the question , what do you say when you murder an alligator . eraser runs a fast 1 : 45 thanks to excellent editing by michael tronick . the film is rated r . there is no sex or nudity , and the language is mild . since this is an action flick , there is violence with lots of people being killed and some blood , but overall , it is much less gory than typical r rated action films - more like a shoot-'em-up western . it is fine for teenagers , but not too much younger . i saw some dads taking their 8-10 year olds into the film which i think is too immature an age for this much violence . i give the film a strong recommendation . you will like the actions and the stunts and will probably be rolling over with laughter too . i give the film * * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	martin scorsese's bringing out the dead might have been more aptly titled acting like the dead . the near comatose movie has a few scenes of black humor that work , but generally the story just drags until the ending credits finally put the film out of its misery . in the starring role , nicolas cage plays his usual crazy character , which varies only in the degree of the insanity . the movie makes their jobs look horrible and their resulting conduct seem a natural reaction to their environment . most of the film is an awkward blend of gritty , new york city realism and over-the-top black comedy . overlaid on the scenes are frank's pretentious musings . and " i was a great relief mop . it was enough that i just showed up . " ) paul schrader's meandering script is based on a joe connelly novel . the story's only completely satisfying sequence has frank continuing to try , without any success , to get himself fired . gore is everywhere , and frank's white shirt is usually polka dotted with blood splatters . the hospital is such a mad house that you'll feel like arresting the staff and the patients for disorderly conduct . the three manage to rise a little above the hackneyed level of the scripting . " it's been bad lately , but it's always bad , " frank says of the condition in the emergency room . the same could be said of most of the movie . it is rated r for gritty violent content , drug use and language and would be acceptable for teenagers who are both older and can handle horrific images . 
0	highlander : endgame , as confusingly written by joel soisson , directed by douglas aarniokoski and edited by the committee of chris blunden , rod dean , tracy granger and michael n . knue , isn't merely a bad movie , it is a stupefyingly awful one . even though its story is ripe for lampooning , the movie takes itself quite seriously . the fourth , and please last , in the highlander series , it probably has a group of avid fans who understand it all . i , however , not being a member of this cinematic cult found the plot to be an impenetrable mess . in a darkly-lit film , in which everyone wears the same dingy robes , it is hard to keep straight just who is who . i'll try to tell you what i learned from the factoids that the movie threw at me , but i suspect this will be one of those reviews where highlander groupies will discover errors aplenty . ( if you are a highlander aficionado , please do not write me as this is not the sort of film that i care to waste my time discussing . ) this much i know . you'll be glad to know that immortality is an equal opportunity employer , including both sexes and many races . when the movie , which switches timeframes frequently and delights in making them all look similar , is set in the present , the immortals' transportation of choice are noisy motorbikes . some immortals are good and some are bad . and sometimes they change sides -- i think . personally , i would have gotten a really big charge if i could have killed them all . amid all the blood and the battles , the immortals pause briefly on occasion to share some bit of wisdom with us . i have no idea what that means , but , since an immortal said it , you can be sure that it must be profound . it is rated r for violence and some strong sexuality and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
0	the first species was a moderately-successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects , a few well- paced action sequences , and frequent views of model-turned-actress natasha henstridge sans clothing . however , it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel . and , considering the quality of species 2 , it's obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead . the only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is . if you throw away the plot , which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence , logic , coherence , and consistency , species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience . there's enough blood , gore , simulated sex , and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring . this is a grade z exploitation flick that's ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment . somewhere , someplace , i recall hearing species 2 described as " erotic . " sure , there's a lot of sex and nudity , but it's almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a woman's abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free , splattering blood and gore in all directions . anyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater . i suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge ( and , to get the obvious question out of the way -- yes , she does remove her top , but only once , and only briefly ) . i'm not sure what the budget for species 2 was , but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors ( as opposed to being diverted into the special effects ) . ditto for james cromwell , who plays patrick's father -- " underused " is too kind a word to describe his involvement ( " invisible " would be more like it ) . george dzundza gets to do a little scenery- chewing as an angry-but-inept general . meanwhile , justin lazard's performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge's limited abilities look good by comparison . the only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson , who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick . complete with cheesy special effects , bare breasts around every narrative corner , and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter , species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics . director peter medak , a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume , has added another forgettable title , but at least he appears to have had fun doing it , which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness . do i recommend the movie ? absolutely not , but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it didn't try my patience to the degree that some pseudo-intellectual bad movies do . here's hoping there's no species 3 . " my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . " -- david puttnam 
2	the conflict inside him revolves around the tremendous high he gets over saving a life- there is no better feeling , he tells us in a voiceover , his usual way of conveying to the viewer what he is thinking- and the low point is from all the depravity and hopelessness and horror he sees all around him everyday . these images become a reminder of what hell might look like . that in a nutshell is the plot of the film , as this is a story mostly about character development and the unique personalities of those who choose to work under such trying conditions , and of the uncertain relationship that develops between two kindred spirits , mary and frank . the audience is taken along for the grim ride and the entertainment comes from the constant gallows humor of these very obsessively comedic ems men , who provide the necessary breaks in the story for everyone concerned , that is audience and driver alike . things are so insane that if you don't laugh , you can succumb to the intensity of the situation by just watching it . this is a dark comedy in the real sense of being dark , with the noir style to the film provided by scorsese's frequent screenwriter , paul schrader ( taxi driver/raging bull/the last temptation of christ ) . this seems to give the patient a pulse and the family some hope . frank's way is through coffee , whiskey , vitamin shots , and living with ghosts-- and none of them work . this film is intense all right , and it drags on for much too long a look at the insane world it envisions , making its way through a grotesque looking city and a hospital that is likened to a crazy house . the misery uncovered is catching , like certain diseases are . but is it worth it ? does the film have something salient to say , as scorsese seems more comfortable in these surroundings than he did in the foreign turf of the age of innocence and kundun , for instance ? is there entertainment value in this story ? that i really don't know , but i do know that it all seemed too real and that the acting was superb , one couldn't help but get entangled in the lives of the characters , and there was a rush of adrenaline emanating from the highs and even the lows experienced . the nicolas cage performance caught the nuances of his character in a bewitching manner , as in his crazed ems role , he catches the futility and desperation he feels gnawing at him from inside and displays an engaging chemistry with the three drivers and with patricia arquette . the ambulance drivers more or less drove home the philosophical points of the film , as they acted out the insanity of the situation they were in and complemented his mood swings of being beaten down or hyper , with the sheer madness of their gall and sometimes perversive attitude toward the job . the photography was mesmerizing , capturing the hostile living conditions of the neighborhood and filling the screen at times with the beauty of a fire show amid the sirens and turbulence of the night , and in the background , we can see the famous city skyscrapers of the city shimmering in the night sky , seemingly changing colors . i'm glad that scorsese has made a film that asks a lot of questions of the viewer , questions that take time to answer because they are complex , and could best be answered by one's experience with matters of life and death . and from what is mentioned in the story , we learn that there are spirits that pull you one way or the other , and sometimes the pull is not to want to live anymore . that should give one something to think about . scorsese has made a technically perfect film and an artistic one , but is one that is not suited for everyone's taste , since it takes getting used to the trauma of the story and its appalling inertia ; but , the benefits are immense for those who stick with it . scorsese is undoubtedly one of the finest working directors and he knows how to provoke an audience to feel the pain of someone else , something that is very difficult to obtain in this medium . this is a very tough film to honestly say that you thoroughly enjoyed it , but what's more important than that , is how it lingers with you for a long time after seeing it and how compelling it is in a meaningful way . this film , i expect , will be better thought of than most films of the '90s that attempt to focus in on the city landscape , including all those films that were so entertaining but in the end were not as nurturing to the soul as this one was . it is easy to compare this film to his masterpiece , taxi driver , and say that both films were about a dying city , about someone who works by driving either a taxi or ambulance at night , and about a similar hero who had a tortured soul that needed redemption , but the former film was so much better because it had more action in it , more energy , and did not compromise the story's pessimism . but i found this film to be more subtle and more optimistic in a spiritual sense , and even its most pressing fault , that the subject matter hits too close to the miserable reality of things in the city and makes this a difficult film to sit through , should not be that deterring to the serious moviegoer . this film can't help being anything but a disturbing film , one that questions the degree of contemporary insanity , and it is not necessarily a better or worse film than the other one , but it is one that has more psychological layers of complexity to it that needs to be looked at more carefully . 
1	the interest in the show is provided by hurt's character more than the boy's although the script was written , i think , to have the movie center around the boy . the scenes where the boys trashes his house and he just stares without speaking were a bit much even for his withdrawn character . i did not buy these scenes . on the whole though , hurt plays it very convincingly , and you feel really sorry for him . the main problem in the show for me was the casting of the boy . he was supposed to be an enigma , but he carried it overboard . during most of the movie it was hard to understand anything at all about what the boy was feeling and hence hard to empathize with him . the director ( chris menges ) should have realized this and given him better guidance . all of the minor characters were quite good except the role played by john hurt ( no relation to william ) which seemed to be out of another movie . my favorite minor character was jane horrocks's portrayal of the social worker . she was the only funny character in the movie and every one of her lines was a riot . i wish her part had been made larger . given that everyone loved her in life is sweet whereas i hated her in it , i was surprised myself at how enchanted i was with her acting in second best . just watching the movie may make you want to move to the serenity of wales - lovely cinematography ( ashley rowe ) . a lot of the movie was either sad or disturbing because of the subject matter . the movie runs 1 : 45 and is rated pg-13 for self-inflicted bloody wounds and some frightening subject matter . i think it would be okay for mature teenagers . i recommend this serious movie to you and give * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	a slight melodramatic story , but an efficiently made moral tale with noir overtures . this film does a good job of poking holes at that dream , showing underneath the surface all is not well . but the nightmare indicates more than that , as it indicates there is something troubling even the youngsters brought up in this so-called ideal environment . 
0	the rest of the cast appear to be either escapees from a fashion shoot or wax museum versions of once famous action stars . harlin burns through more money than a pork-loving congressman feasting on surpluses as far as the eye can see . these car crashes look like every racing video game that you've ever seen , with the most spectacular being by far the most ludicrous . harlin has the camera come in so close that you can see every pore on the actors' faces and every imperfection on the tires' rubber . these close-ups are performed in nauseatingly fast , blurring pans and accompanied by rapid fire editing . kind of makes you want to puke . a sensation that the hackneyed script also induces ( " everyone falls down . it's just how fast you get up that counts .

0	following the travesty that was 1996's ill-fated attempt to update sgt . bilko , i was prepared to state that i couldn't imagine a worse tv retread . however , what my mind could not conceive , hollywood has produced . in fact , mchale's navy isn't just worse -- it's fifteen minutes longer , which means that not only do viewers have to defend against yet another assault of truly uninspired content , but they have to endure fifteen percent more of it . one of the central questions about mchale's navy is why anyone would want to make a movie out of this particular '60s show . i suppose it was mildly diverting in its first incarnation , but of all the tv programs to resurrect , this wouldn't be near the top of most peoples' lists . lt . commander quinton mchale isn't the kind of figure people recall with great fondness when looking back on old sit-coms . and , considering how poorly the beverly hillbillies and sgt . bilko performed at the box office , one could be forgiven for assuming that hollywood has gotten the message that america's passion for nostalgia only goes so far . mchale's navy , as realized by director bryan spicer and screenwriter peter crabbe , is suitable only for movie-goers who have undergone frontal lobotomies . the dearth of intelligence makes this film as painful to sit through as any of 1997's other worst offenders , and i wonder why more people didn't walk out of the screening i attended . had i not been reviewing the film , i would have headed for the exit about a half hour into the movie . mchale is supposed to be likable , but , the way arnold plays him , everyone in the audience is praying that someone will shoot him , drown him , or do something to him that would be unacceptable in a pg-rated movie . mchale's navy wouldn't be so bad if it was remotely funny , but , by the last reel , i was so starved for amusement that i was considering sneaking into a showing of liar liar next door . this is inept film making . even fans of the tv show , once their curiosity has worn off about how the new group of actors play their old favorites , won't find much to appreciate about a motion picture that needs to fill the screen with pyrotechnics to camouflage the lack of material . mchale's navy deserves to be sunk so deeply that no one will ever think of dredging it up again . 
1	i feel like i've just taken a time trip back to the '80s . well , they're back again , and stronger than ever . scream started this recent wave , and its $100+ million box office gross has ensured a host of sequels and inferior copycats . i know what you did last summer , brought to the screen by neophyte director jim gillespie , is the second , and there are many more to come . i know what you did last summer bears almost all the hallmarks of a classic slasher movie . the large-breasted female protagonist does some incredibly dumb things . every character is strictly one-dimensional -- there's no desire or attempt to form anything resembling a full-fledged personality out of any of these cardboard stereotypes . there's plenty of blood and gore ( although , to be fair , one could argue that it's restrained here ) . the only thing that's missing are flashes of female flesh . gratuitous nudity was always big in the '80s films . apparently , that's no longer the case . of course , the killer has to be dressed in some kind of costume -- that's a slasher movie requisite . in scream , it was the grim reaper . so what face of terror do we have in i know what you did last summer ? that's right -- rain slicker , hat , and all . i kept expecting to hear the theme song playing in the background . the screenwriter of i saw what you did last summer is kevin williamson , who made a name for himself by penning scream . those two movies give him a unique distinction . with i saw what you did last summer , he has now written a film of the very type that his other script parodied . scream had a lot of fun playing with ideas , conventions , and approaches that i saw what you did last summer takes very seriously . and the genuine scares of scream have mostly been replaced by silly , repetitive shock tactics ( one exception : a creepy cat-and-mouse game in a department store ) . this points out the main weakness of i saw what you did last summer . the characters aren't interesting enough for us to be scared for them . they just add to the body count , and everyone knows that the really good slasher movies have inordinately high death rates . the story sounds more interesting that it is . i wasn't dazzled by any of the acting in this film , but it's rare that a slasher movie is characterized by oscar-caliber performances . there is one minor aspect of the plot that elevates i saw what you did last summer above the level of a typical '80s slasher flick -- it has an interesting subtext . sadly , this potentially-fascinating element of the movie is dismissed quickly to facilitate a higher body count . and , as i said before , a few extra deaths can only make a slasher movie better , right ? " for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake . " 
1	in it he questions american values , suggesting that it is better to lose and be a nice person than to win and stand for nothing but your own self-aggrandizement . she becomes the easily recognizable villain in payne's satire of american society . makes harelik's love for her seem highly improbable . paul is one of those rich kids who is very nice and very popular , but who is not a very sophisticated or manipulative person . in some ways , this film reminded me of two diverse recent films i saw , welcome to the dollhouse and rushmore . they all had an anger to them , pointing at something in society that is not all that it appears to be and saying that is where the problem lies . in this screenplay , by payne and jim taylor , it has accurately captured a certain look and feel high school has about it . this film was able to show how its school was not conducive for the individual to feel free in . that all the characters are flawed , unable to see beyond the very narrow limits they operate under has made for a very trying tale . the film just didn't know how to end its story by landing on its feet . it had a great performance by matthew broderick , who was subtle and obvious enough to bring out the inner and outer conflicts in his life . yet , the main problem remaining is that aside from the flaws of all the characters involved , there is no one else to blame for the moral dilemma that is presented . 
1	these misguided adventures are things a kid needing but not getting parental help might do . he considers these episodes to be ernest hemingway-like experiences . the film with all its fantastic developments and its obscure way to tell a story , still remains grounded in reality , accurately picturing the wasteland of suburban life in the 1980s . the charming adrian grenier is appealing to a certain extent as the hero who is both naive and adventurous in a self-destructive way . clark gregg plays his role as someone who feels inside like a woman , but who has been a man so long and still looks like one , that there is certain smugness he has that he can be both a man and a woman . but , the story never leaps beyond its startling revelation of a father undergoing a sex change and the devastating reaction it has for his family . it seems to wither towards its climax . when we see him hitting baseballs at a batting range and then beating up someone who makes fun of him , we're into a typical macho hollywood response mode to such problems , and it becomes apparent that this character will remain underdeveloped . the film setups an engaging story but didn't take it anywhere special , as it was a let down after such a fast start and such a promising look at a youngster needing guidance and getting it from such an unlikely source as gregg . you can rest assured , that this offbeat teenager comedy/drama , returns safely back to its genre's teen movie fold by the film's end , and that is its main fault . 
2	it was while editing metropolitan that i started reconsidering . . . . i found myself losing interest in metropolitan's nominal protagonist , the male-ingenue tom , and wanting to see more of the characters taylor nichols and chris eigeman played . . . i had written metropolitan under the conviction that life is essentially an eventless affair and to make a movie full plot and incident would be a false and unauthentic repetition of genre movie cliches . in the interval between the two scripts i changed my mind : life does have its melodramatic turns , and , while melodramatic events might not seem especially interesting in themselves , they could provide another prism to examine the lives of the characters affected . " in barcelona , nothing goes quite as you expect it to . in a broad sense , certain things are played out as anticipated , but there are always little quirks to be aware of . filtered through a somewhat detached and ironic perspective , this film is the distillation of an intriguing blend of romantic comedy , satire , drama , and philosophy . whit stillman's sophomore film seems a little like what one might expect if british director mike newell and french filmmaker eric rohmer combined on a project . barcelona is replete with the loaded , pithy dialogue that rohmer is known for , as well as the dry wit which has marked newell's more recent pictures . in fact , elements of the epilogue are oddly similar to the fourth act of four weddings and a funeral , including the careful veiling of the bride's identity . the first half of this movie races past at a frantic pace , its momentum gained more through its nearly-constant dialogue than because of any significant plot development . things happen , to be sure , but everything is on a small scale . the best moments in barcelona involve snippets of offbeat conversations about mundane facets of life . some of these--like fred's musings about the " correct " way to shave--are completely facetious , but others are designed to provoke a moment's genuine thought , such as ted and ramon's opposing views on the importance of physical beauty . unfortunately , the second half of the movie can't match the level of what preceded it . as the plot gains prominence , some of barcelona's unique freshness dissipates . for the last thirty minutes , the script settles into a fairly routine dramatic pattern . the acting is done mostly by low-profile performers . barcelona is one of those movies that contains just about everything ( and a lot of it ) except action . the plot is a vehicle for the characters ( and their intelligently-scripted dialogue ) --a method , as stillman says , of viewing different aspects of ted and fred's lives . however , while the film's initial charm may lie in its humorous perspective of this pair of mismatched cousins , its lasting impression ( for men at least ) may involve wondering exactly how to hold the razor . 
1	screenplay : andrew w . marlowe . director : paul verhoeven . mpaa rating : r ( violence , gore , profanity , nudity , adult themes ) running time : 114 minutes . hollow man follows in the fine tradition of james whale's 1933 version of the invisible man , in which claude rains loses his mind and goes on a murderous rampage . we understand this instinctively to be realistic because it's in the dna of every heterosexual adolescent male to define invisibility as the power to walk into the girls' locker room with impunity . hell yes we'd engage in a little mischief if no one could see us ; even the best of us might find it hard to resist the temptation . power corrupts , and so on and so forth . hollow man could have been a provocative examination of what that temptation would do to one of the best of us . the invisibility serum works on caine , but the reversal serum is not so successful , stranding caine in his invisible state . a bunch of techno-babble sets up the notion that the subjects of caine's serum are " out of phase with the visible universe " blah blah blah , and disappear from the outside in , one layer at a time . in fact , hollow man is awash in nifty visual tricks cleverly implemented : the thermal view of a full frontal bacon ; a scene of caine vomiting up invisible food in silent answer to that age-old question ; bacon's ghostly visage appearing in water , smoke and a tossed bag of blood . as effects-heavy thrillers go , this one at least makes every moment of technological gee-whizzery genuinely worth a gee-whiz . what it lacks , in essence , is anything that can be called a story . there's a vacant spot in the center of the film even before caine vanishes , because there's nothing remotely sympathetic about him from the outset . while we can still see him , he's an obnoxious sort who makes off-color jokes and mocks the vivisection of his lab animals . there's no character arc to sebastian caine ; hollow man merely presents the fairly self-evident answer to the question , " what would happen if you granted omnipotence to a cruel , self-absorbed bastard with a god complex ? " the script doesn't even give a character arc to its ostensible protagonist , shue's dr . mckay . perhaps she too could have been tempted , or learned something about scientific hubris . ultimately , it's nothing but a technically proficient mad slasher movie . make that a fairly diverting , technically proficient mad slasher movie , at least during its high-energy third act . the film turns from a gloss on cronenberg's the fly to a gloss on both alien and aliens ( though i actually enjoyed the nod to westworld , with josh brolin following in papa james' footsteps in a cat-and-mouse game involving thermal perception ) . the final 20 minutes becomes a frantic and generally entertaining hack-n-slash through the supporting cast members , leading up to an appropriately ridiculous climax . it's too bad verhoeven and screenwriter andrew w . marlowe weren't interested in putting some meat on hollow man's bones . even with all its visceral appeal , it could have been so much more interesting to watch the story of the guy who wants to walk into the girls' locker room with impunity , instead of the guy who wants to walk into the girls' locker room and blow it up . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
0	deep blue sea is a movie about intelligence and the lack thereof . ( i'm not making this up . ) on the unintelligent side is just about everyone else . a question should also be raised about the sanity of the film's backers . when he first pitched the movie , he should have been turned down flat . a disaster movie set in the ocean , in which we watch sharks slowly eat most of the cast , isn't exactly original or interesting . and the script by duncan kennedy , wayne powers and donna powers is completely ridiculous . the movie wastes the first half-hour slowly introducing us to the players . ( if you get the urge to walk out during this dead period , do not resist . ) saffron burrows plays dr . susan mcalester , who is perfectly willing to sacrifice everyone in the name of science -- her father had alzheimer's , you see . there are many others . the filmmakers need plenty of shark food . finally , the only cast member to insert any humanity into the picture is ll cool j as the religious , cross-carrying cook . played seriously , the movie is no parody , although it becomes so ludicrous that you will laugh , and loudly , on occasion . but this laughter is that of pain as you realize what an awful movie the studios are subjecting you to . castor oil would taste good in comparison . the film is definitely worst of the year material . on the other hand , if they start giving awards for actors who manage to keep a straight face during a ridiculous farce , every member of this cast would be contenders , save ll cool j , who seems to understand how noisome it is . " it's pretty scary stuff , huh ? " the problem in the movie is that no matter how many people are bitten in two , it's never the least bit scary because it's never credible . fear comes only when you can believe what you see . nothing in deep blue sea is the least bit believable . the list of nonsensical events in the movie is endless . is there any scene worth saving in the movie ? yes , the film contains , hands-down , the best anti-smoking commercial imaginable . deep blue sea runs way too long at 1 : 45 . the movie would be acceptable for teenagers . 
1	screenplay : neil gaiman , adapted from the screenplay by hayao miyazaki . director : hayao miyazaki . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 136 minutes . somehow , somewhere , this whole " anime " wave has left me behind . sure , the japanese animation style is distinctive , but it strikes me that the form has not progressed radically in the 30 years since " speed racer . " though the backgrounds may have become richer , there's still a vaguely anglicized blandness to the character design , a strange lack of fluidity to the acrobatic movements . when the japanese smash princess mononoke made its way to our shores , it was spoken of as the future of animation . i was skeptical that it would bring anything that wasn't already the past of anime . from an animation standpoint , i still think that's true , though princess mononoke does have some striking imagery . the real revelation in the film is the depth and complexity of its mythology and storytelling , which manage to overcome the problems with the human story . in case there is any confusion on the subject , let's be clear that princess mononoke is a film for adults . it also maintains an adult tone in the set-up of its mystical world , with gods who can be petulant , violent and even just plain stupid ( a cosmology far more in keeping with most ancient civilizations' mythologies than disney's benign pantheisms ) . most impressive , miyazaki keeps his story free of the didacticism so common in films with environmental themes . rare is the tale that suggests industry could be a co-existing entity in nature , rather than an inherent evil . princess mononoke is so engrossing as both legend and lesson that you wish it could treat its characters with more care . the line readings by the english actors are flat and constricted , performances set to a stopwatch of mouth movements instead of to the needs of the scene . and then there's the dialogue , which generally ranges from the annoyingly literalist ( characters seem incapable of looking at a thing without calling out its name ) to the purely giggle-inducing ( i don't believe i'll ever embrace unreservedly a film that includes the line , " forest spirit , we give you back your head " ) . princess mononoke at times appears to be an animated variation on this year's more ballyhooed version of mythopoetics over substance , the phantom menace . still , there is something compelling about the look of princess mononoke , more so than i was expecting . the design of the supernatural characters is always intriguing , from the writhing worm-bodies of the demons to the pillsbury doughboy-cum-tiki-idol sprites called the kodamas ; the battlefields are arresting in their gore-spattered silence . indeed , silence plays an unexpectedly effective role in this epic film , giving it a sense of reverence . there's just the problem of those darned people , whose homogeneity in word and countenance hinders an otherwise stellar effort . anime may be more or less what it used to be , but at least the storytelling behind it is growing up . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
0	screenplay : tom ricostronza and paris qualles . director : matty rich . despite the credit , no one named tom ricostronza worked on the script for the inkwell . novelist trey ellis , who developed the original screenplay , made a rancorous departure from the production over philosophical differences with matty rich , and substituted a pseudonym which is a loose italian translation for " full of excrement . " whatever the specific points of disagreement might have been , it would appear that ellis knew something that rich did not . it is clear that the inkwell could have been a gentle look at a rarely- seen side of the black american experience ; instead , it's a sloppy and ham-fisted collection of caricatures which seems to trip over an occasional truth rather than aiming for any . at times , i thought i might end up liking the inkwell . there was a relaxed , nostalgic tone to some of the scenes featuring drew , and larenz tate brought a geeky , confused charm to drew's fumblings through adolescence . but for every scene which endeared , there were two which annoyed . the inkwell tempts you with sweetness , then smacks you over the head every time you try to embrace it . it's also exceedingly hard to take the inkwell at all seriously with so many characters so miserably realized . glynn turman huffs and puffs as the unashamedly republican uncle spencer , delivering one of those horrible drunken diatribes that only movie drunks deliver . and that's really the fundamental problem with the inkwell . since i knew exactly where it was going , its only chance to work for me was in how it took me there . i wanted to be interested in drew's story , but i was repeatedly drawn away by the seemingly pointless class struggle between kenny and spencer ; i wanted to lose myself in the characters , and they repeatedly reminded me they were phony . time and again , i found myself convinced that matty rich had no real sense of what he wanted to do with this story , so he did a little bit of everything . and somewhere , trey ellis must be having the last laugh . 
1	when i was growing up , the kids' movies , even ( or especially ) the b movies , had one redeeming feature : a fascination with science . what better way to enliven a kid's imagination than a science fiction film ? the honey i shrunk the kids series provides not only science fiction , but the appreciation for creativity and the whole invention process . moreover , they celebrate quirky people as people to be admired rather than ridiculed since their big ideas might just work . the second film in this series is director randal kleiser's honey i blew up the kid . released in 1992 , it represents a nicely done b movie for the whole family . the slightly hokey special effects are just realistic enough not to be ridiculed . the premise of the show is that wayne is trying to perfect a machine to enlarge items . beside , what more visually interesting place to film a giant than a backdrop of neon figures as big as this godzilla-sized toddler . i will not reveal the resolution to their predicament , but here's a hint . " there's one thing every little kid knows , " diane tells us . a film that from start to finish is good spirited family fun , it never lapses into parody and never pretends to be more than it is . honey i blew up the kid runs just 1 : 29 . it is rated pg , but i am not sure why . the film would be fine for all ages . the recent video honey we shrunk ourselves is our 8-year-old jeffrey's favorite in this series , but he likes honey i blew up the kid too . i recommend this picture to you and your family and give it * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

0	what can i say about a film that was laugh-out-loud funny in spots , was driven by a fantastic performance by bruce willis as a contract killer , but was disturbingly vulgar ( the murder of an undercover cop is used as part of the comedy routine ) , except to say that it was driven by characters who seem to enjoy their work and working with each other . it was also a more palatable of a film than i thought it would be . these demented zany characters , not one of them who was without a blemished soul ( reminiscent of pulp fiction and analyze this ) , is a popular reworking of the gangster film into comedy , a phenomena of recent times worth taking note of in the gangster genre . the result is a film that gets over , more or less , as a parody . a film that is farcical and loopy , but leaves a lot to be desired . it still looks likes like a sitcom to me . the plot starts off simple and then becomes more complicated as more characters are introduced . she is disappointed that the likable oz can't make a good living out of his practice . he tells him he works for janni and after punching the dentist around offering some more excuses for sight gags and pratfalls , he brings him to see janni . the conversation from the heavily accented janni goes something like this , " i yust hate yimmy . the british born director jonathan lynn ( my cousin vinny ) , after a so-far mediocre career , has become more skilled at pacing a film , as the non-stop action scenes make the film fly by quickly , which might actually be its best asset . this is lighweight entertainment and should work well if one chooses to overlook a flawed script , questionable values , and that there are no nice people in the film . but . . . the film is funny . 
1	although i was a teenager in the 60s , i do not remember her at all . i thought i knew of all the rock groups from that period , and i do not recall them or her . oh well , memory fads . now , knowing nothing about a subject is actually the preferable state for viewing a documentary . late last year i saw a great documentary called theremin : an electronic odyssey . before seeing it , i had never heard of a crazy little musical device called a theremin . nevertheless , i loved the documentary while hating the screechy sounds that bizarre gadget produces . on the good side , the film is an honest depiction of a person devoid of humanity , and it teaches us what can happen in such circumstances . i like being confined . i like being locked in a closet . " she sang one of the morose songs she wrote which went , " make me fly , let me die , make me fly . " her songs have little feeling or musical interest . although she appeared in such films as la dolce vita and chelsea girls , i would not go so far as to say she acted in any of them based on the clips shown . the documentary is effective at illustrating loneliness and what it can do to a person's spirit . on the bad side , as a documentary , this picture is a mess . it never presents a compelling case of why we should care about nico . moreover , the filmmaker has a leaden approach . sometimes loud music ( mark mothersbaugh ) overlays the interview for emphasis . other times , the editors ( elfe brandenburger and guido krajewski ) will overlap videos and still images in a failed attempt to pump energy into a film that glorifies lifelessness . i did learn a lot about someone i had never known , and although it is sad , i wish ofteringer had made a much better case as to the point of the film . it is not rated , but i would guess it would get an r for all of the drug references . there is brief nudity , but no sex or violence , and i the language is pretty clean . it would be fine for any teenager . although i found parts interesting , the documentary is so poorly developed that i can not quite bring myself to recommend it . if you are one of those people who remember her , you will probably like the film more than i did . i give the movie * * for the insights i did gain . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : may 8 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	she -- no surprise -- barks out the exact textbook definition from memory . tracy , as we will learn , knows the definition but not the meaning . writer and director alexander payne , whose last picture was the delicious satire citizen ruth , is back again with an even better satirical piece , election . although it plows some of the same fertile ground as rushmore , the more consistent election bears even more fruit . as the picture's star , reese witherspoon plays the anal-retentive tracy flick with a nuanced performance that's light-years ahead of her marvelous work in pleasantville . dressed in conservative tweed skirts with dull , avocado-colored stockings , she is prim , proper and prissy . if there were an academy award for body language , witherspoon would win it hands down for this performance . the best comes when the excessively serious tracy gets some good news . matthew broderick , reminding us again after the godzilla debacle what an excellent actor he can be , plays award-winning teacher jim mcallister . the subtle script takes a chirpy , upbeat attitude to its black comedy material . the editor freeze-frames the characters , especially tracy , in the most unflattering ways . tracy may project utter confidence and some wide-eyed innocence , but these freeze-frames show the ugliness that lies just below the surface . the movie really shines in its small touches . the pre-election prayer scene is quite illuminating . it might not be whom you suspect . the screenwriters manage to make the story enthralling even though they make what looks like a mistake and let the story go on past its natural conclusion . it is rated r for sex , profanity and a brief dope smoking scene and would be fine for older teenagers . 
0	a beautiful piece of junk , amounting to a spectacle for the eyes only , as the film itself couldn't justify the violence and human depravity shown . this surreal thriller amounts to a beautifully photographed and stylish film . there is no rational payoff to explain what is happening except this is some pretty sick stuff we are seeing . it's a vile film , that tries to take the film down the same road as coppola's " the conversation " and where a number of other morally blurred films about voyeurism had gone , aiming mostly , perhaps , along the lines of brian de palma's suspenseful works . it works into its story devices from a multitude of other films , except this one just didn't add up and seemed to dwell on the grisly violence the woman psychopathic killer commits and offered no valid critical reason to justify all the gore in this beautiful looking but pointless film . lang flatly plays a sympathetic agent in eye's workplace who always appears on a laptop screen . since nothing in this film made sense , why should one expect her role to ! so the film ends as clumsily and distantly as it was throughout . as all we get from this film are some cheap exploitive thrills and a tease that there is some intellectual message hidden in all the mental gymnastics , but what we really have , is a film that failed to get untracked . 
2	place your foot on the accelerator . watch the needle on the speedometer creep above fifty . now you're trapped . whatever happens , you can't drop below that level--if you do , you're dead , and everyone on the bus with you . it might not be tough to maintain that speed on the freeway in the middle of the night , but this is rush hour . so what do you do when the traffic comes to a screeching halt up ahead , without an off-ramp in sight ? it's an ingenious premise that first-time director jan de bont has turned into a tremendously well-executed motion picture . good action movies are rare . great action movies come along once every few years . speed deserves a place in the latter category , being the most intelligent and breath-stoppingly thrilling motion picture to open since the original die hard . normally , i like to write reviews immediately after seeing a movie . on this occasion , i had to wait until the next morning--speed wore me out . this is a film that cries out for audience participation , whether it be the silent majority's digging of fingers into armrests or the vocal minority's cheers and catcalls . speed is by no means an intellectual challenge , but it's probably the most fun you can have in any theater at this time . and there are a lot of them . a whole lot . you could almost call this film planes , trains , and automobiles , although for entirely different reasons than those behind the naming of the steve martin/john candy flick . speed is clearly divided into three acts , each no less draining than the others . the film may clock in at nearly two hours , but the time , like the various vehicles , races . there is , quite literally , never a dull moment . of course , there are plot contrivances . how could there not be ? but these are subtle and convincingly woven into the fabric of the story . while watching speed , you may notice one or two ( for an example , consider how a bus traveling at fifty-two can slam into a car and have its speed not drop below the red line ) , but you won't care much . the low-level but persistent humor is used to blot the tension . most of the one-liners aren't as good as those in die hard , but a few are worth a chuckle , and they serve their purpose . this is not , after all , supposed to be a comedy . i never thought i'd be saying this , but keanu reeves does an excellent job . reeves' attitude and physical appearance are ideal , and even those who visibly winced during his scenes in much ado about nothing are likely to accept him here . there are reasons why the preview audiences have been raving about speed , and a purpose to moving the opening date from august to june . this movie is a winner , and the closest you can get to an amusement park ride in a theater . perhaps the same warning that's used for roller coasters should be applied here . you know , the one about high blood pressure and heart problems . oh , and one more thing . don't make speed the first film in a double bill . no matter what the second movie is , it will suffer by comparison . if you still have the stamina left to see it , that is .

" my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . " -- david puttnam 
0	going into this film , i expected it to be an obligatory late-summer , mindless , plotless action films . i was wrong . it's a late-summer , mindless , plotless action film with a message . i think i prefer this sorts of film when it doesn't try to preach . somehow , sermonizing and beating peoples' brains in don't make an appealing combination . don't look for even a whiff of originality in this film . it takes plot elements from one movie and mixes them with those from about fifty others . needless to say , this leads to a lot of confusion , and at least three plot threads which come to abrupt and inexplicable dead-ends . talk about a jarring turn of events . . . . somebody should bring this miracle worker to the president's attention . what's even more astounding is that luis never gets stabbed or shot . there are some token guns and knives in evidence , but nothing close to what you'd expect at the high school from hell . guns , you see , would have gotten in the way of the message , not to mention the unfair advantage they would have given the bad guys . speaking of which , the script does everything it possibly can to make silverio the meanest hombre you've ever laid eyes on . he's nasty , sadistic , and beats up our hero without breaking much of a sweat . even i , cynical viewer that i am , felt an occasional stirring of raw animal hatred for this satan incarnate . actually , paco christian prieto does a more than passable job as the bad guy--if you're looking for someone who overacts the part to the hilt . geoffrey lewis , who has played a lot of bit parts in movies and tv shows , does an absolutely embarrassing job as the good-hearted teacher kerrigan . most of the kick boxing sequences are entertaining to watch ( at least compared to the rest of the movie ) , although sometimes the action goes so fast that it's difficult to figure out who's who . in the climactic " match , " the problem is largely resolved by having one character a couple of feet taller than the other , but even that doesn't eliminate all the confusion . for those who thought the ending of scent of a woman was pure " cornball , " you ain't seen nothin' yet . take a look at the final scene of only the strong and you'll note that it's got pacino's film beaten by a long stretch . of course , there's a massive leap of illogic needed to get to the finale here , but that fact generally gets lost in the massive overdose of artificial sweetener that the audience is subjected to . there is one good thing that i can say about only the strong . it isn't boring--or at least not too boring . if you want somebody to listen , you'd better put together something worth listening too , not a movie stopping oh-so-briefly in the theaters on the way to the video store . 
1	given the financial success of the original , it was probably inevitable that disney would try to mine the vein one more time for some cinematic gold . although a highly polished production , the sequel pales in significance to its predecessor . this time the story is a romeo and juliet retread . the story probably sounds more impressive than it is . whereas the original had such a mesmerizing story , the sequel succeeds in spite of rather than because of the story . just as he was unable to carry godzilla a few months ago , here he just does not have a powerful enough presence to be credible as the king of the jungle . there are only a few reasons to rent or buy the sequel : the images , the music , and the humor , and each of these is seriously compromised . most the images were probably handsome before they were transferred to videotape , but on vhs they are sorely lacking . the dazzling , radiant colors from film stock lose so much in the transfer . there are a few dull scenes , such as the big , ending lion battle that would be mediocre in any medium . to be fair , in comparison with most direct-to-video releases , this one far outshines most of the others . the music has most of the energy of the original , but the songs aren't quite in the memorable category . let's just call them , well , tuneful . the humor from the original makes a few , much appreciated , guest appearances . still , any movie that relies on flatulence for its biggest laugh has its limitations . disney throws in a few pc lines that reek of tokenism . kiara doesn't like being called by her title . " i'm not just a princess , you know , " she tells timon and pumbaa . " that's just half of who i am . " judged against other direct-to-video releases , this one stands out as a much more expensive and polished production . the result is a pleasant experience but not an involving or memorable one , sort of disney-lite . the lion king ii : simba's pride runs just 1 : 15 . it is rated g and would be fine for the entire family . unlike the original , which might scare some impressionable younger viewers , this one has fewer frightening sequences , although the lions do growl and fight some . my son jeffrey , age 9 , really liked the movie , but he liked the original better because it was more serious , whereas the sequel relied more on humor . he liked the fighting scenes the best . both of them gave it * * * * . 
1	inauspicious beginnings have doomed many a film . so it is with first time director jeb stuart's switchback . switchback opens with the classic a-stranger-is-in-the-house scene so popular in slasher movies and cheap thrillers . and to make sure that he hooks the audience , stuart , who wrote the script for switchback as well as much better films such as the fugitive , carefully includes a child endangerment aspect to the opening . quaid , who frequently has trouble demonstrating much dynamic range as actor , approaches his role in this film with a singleness of purpose . and his terse elocution borders on parody . absent his performance and with a director more adept at staging scenes , the movie would have been much better . the supporting cast almost carries the show . bob goodall , the car's owner , has decorated every inch of his automobile with pictures of naked women -- even the seat belts are covered . then again , one learns in films of this caliber never to discount the minor character or even the one not yet seen as the killer . switchback runs too long at 2 : 01 . it is rated r for violence , profanity , and pinup pictures . the film would be fine for most teenagers . 
2	murder in the first is another example of a movie that strays from historical reality to create a more dramatically-appealing product . and , regardless of how this version raises the hackles of alcatraz aficionados , marc rocco's movie is a solid and affecting example of film making . as a court drama , there's little to distinguish murder in the first . sure , there are the theatrics we expect from high voltage clashes between the defense and the prosecution , but little in the trial sequences set murder in the first apart from numerous predecessors , many of which are far more memorable . nothing here approaches that level . the events leading to young's actions are graphically rendered , and little doubt remains about where the responsibility lies . ultimately , however , it's bacon's performance that elevates the film . here , his usual cocky cynicism is replaced by an erstwhile sincerity . unlike the shawshank redemption , this movie isn't about triumph behind prison bars . some scenes may be too graphic for audience members to view comfortably , but " comfort " isn't on director rocco's agenda . little that occurs towards the end to affect a false sense of dramatic closure reduces the power of bearing witness to the exposure of henri young's soul--or what's left after glenn and alcatraz have finished with it . 
2	next to independence day , trainspotting may be the most hyped motion picture of the summer . miramax films , the distributor that saturated the market with ads for the crying game in 1992-93 and pulp fiction in '94 , has struck again . the danger is , of course , that trainspotting's substance will get drowned by the marketing . " i chose not to choose life . in rejecting the yuppie culture of a nuclear family , material possessions , a paying job , and dental insurance , renton is rebelling , but this isn't just the usual disaffection of youth -- it's a deeper , more pervasive dissatisfaction with a culture he views as sick and stifling . trainspotting is careful not to present a one-sided view of drug use . after all , why would anyone use the stuff if all it leads to is misery and unhappiness ? in renton's words , to get an idea of what it's like using heroin , " take the best orgasm you've ever had , multiply by 1000 , and you're still nowhere near it . " the giddiness of heroin addiction is well-illustrated during some of the film's early scenes , but it's a euphoria that gives way to tragedy . in the end , trainspotting has an anti-drug message , but it presents its case through character studies , not preaching . there are a lot of gruesome images , some of which are presented in an oddly humorous context . boyle's style , however , is distinctly his own . this is a kinetic movie , where everything , including the camera , keeps moving . this isn't an examination of the scottish drug culture from the outside looking in , it's one from the inside looking out . for one hour , trainspotting is as compelling as any motion picture to be released this year . it's exciting , energetic , thought-provoking , and never lets up . unfortunately , during the film's last third , the focus starts to shift , and , in doing so , it blurs . but , while this material has some appeal , it's debatable whether it belongs here . for a segment like this to really work , it needs more time and attention than boyle and screenwriter john hodge are able to give it . as such , the subplot seems almost like an afterthought , taking the film away from its darker , more compelling material and opening the door to a hopeful , if ironic , ending . the overlong epilogue aside , trainspotting is one of the summer's most arresting motion pictures , and not just because of the offbeat visual style . there's nothing new or unique about the story , but it is presented in a manner that reinforces its immediacy and impact . the film makers were determined to make this a street-level view of addiction , not some " voyeuristic oxbridge graduate's perception of these people " . in that goal , they have succeeded , and , while trainspotting is not without its faults , it offers a powerful portrait that all of miramax's overhyping cannot diminish . 
1	this solid western was the only film roy huggins ever directed , as he went on to do tv work creating the maverick series and later on the rockford files . they fear the union's reaction , as they don't expect justice if they surrender . the tense film becomes a character study in bravery , cowardice , innocence , greed , and romance . it was as if a weight were lifted from their shoulders . the film is made potent be scott's austere presence and the dry wit that runs through the script . this results in a very lively film , but also one that is slightly offbeat .

1	take a typical romantic comedy , add a dash of cameron crow's singles , and top it off with a little when harry met sally , and you get reality bites , ben stiller's feature film debut , and the movie that draws out the most memorable performance from winona ryder since heathers ( the age of innocence not excepted ) . it's life without a direction , however . reality bites starts with a lot of promise , but it doesn't take long for its freshness to wear thin . struggling for the feel of singles , the film matches neither the quirkiness nor the honest insight of the 1992 feature . it doesn't take long for the central romantic conflict to become established , and from then to the conclusion , reality bites follows a number of standard formulas . the characters are all types , with little or no depth beyond the expected . this is true not only of the central figures , but the supporting ones as well . it becomes tiresome after a while to continually make accurate predictions of what each character is going to do . commercialism runs rampant , as well . some of the product placements are grossly obvious ( so obvious that i'm willing to give director ben stiller the benefit of the doubt and wonder if he isn't satirizing their use in other movies ) , and the soundtrack has all the marks of something designed to sell cds and tapes . at least when troy is required to sing , it's actually ethan hawke dubbing the vocals . there are some clever moments , the best of which are the satires of mtv- type " cutting edge " programming . winona ryder turns in a strong performance as lelaina , but she is often upstaged by janeane garofalo , who has all the best one-liners . would that the chemistry between ms . ryder and her male co-stars was as strong . this makes it difficult to care about the central romance . also , from the beginning , there's never really any doubt about who lelaina is going to end up with . frankly , i expected more from reality bites . it's certainly a watchable film , but it lacks any semblance of originality . beneath a thin veneer of style , all the old cliches and formulas of typical romantic comedies lie buried . a number of people , especially fans of ms . ryder , will be delighted by this film , but i can't add my voice to their acclaim . reality bites is far too ordinary . 
1	" don't ask why . just take out your pen and write on my arm . " " it reminds me of the scent of skin . " ) greenway is a cinematic stylist whose best known film is perhaps the movie with the enormous title of the cook the thief his wife & her lover . greenway in recent interviews has been railing against the power and the homogeneity of american movies . his films are certainly like no others . in the pillow book , which he wrote , directed , and co-edited , he creates a sumptuous movie in montage . most scenes make heavy use of picture-in-picture techniques , thus making the movie screen look like some feature laden television . part of the film is shot in letterbox with a larger black band at the bottom holding the english subtitles . this asymmetric letterboxing is a projectionist's nightmare . ours almost got tricked . the bizarre story can be followed if you pay close attention , but it is merely a sideshow . the movie exists to show off calligraphy on skin as an art form and to dazzle the viewers with sights and sounds . the best part of the film is the music by brian eno . all of it has a haunting beauty . the french folk songs have subtitles that flow by sing-a-long style in order to focus the audience on the music . the story is a conundrum but with periodically interesting vignettes . >from this comes the tradition of writing on people's torsos . most scenes are off the scale , any scale . it gets even more ludicrous once jerome gets naked in the publisher's office . the film sets a record for the number of shots of male frontal nudity in a non-pornographic film . none of the scenes are erotic and only a few are meant to be . besides the ridiculous story , the movie's other problem is the acting . the actors do not try to be convincing , and the director seems happy to have them all on autopilot . he approaches the film stock as a canvas upon which he will paint a beautiful and shocking portrait . narrative has little importance to him . the pillow book would make a wonderful short film . trimmed down to twenty or thirty minutes , i could easily praise it . as is , it becomes an incredibly long exercise in style . it is not rated but would probably be nc-17 as it contains large amounts of complete nudity as well as explicit sex and one scene of drug abuse . although i was impressed by parts of the filmmaking , i cannot recommend the picture . i give it * * for its impressive and unusual sights and sounds . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : june 5 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	it's a metaphysical love story with a bit of mystery thrown in . there's also more than a bit of a political allegory to it that holds the film together in an intelligent way , as both of the main characters are motivated by political concerns . the love story is complex and is the heart of this engrossing film , a film that deals with the ambiguities that propel people to be who they are . it's a relationship filled with all sorts of possible pitfalls . billy crudup plays the wheedling fielding pierce who's stuck in an empty world of deceit , in a political role much like the robert redford character in the candidate . in fielding's case he never shows that he's even a liberal , only that he's blinded by an urge to achieve success . he will never be quite sure if what he envisioned was real or a figment of his desires , but his sanity at this point is certainly questionable . she states : " i want a life that makes sense . " i don't really know how great this film is , but it did catch my attention ; especially , the way gordon was able to get his main characters to act out who they were and struggle to make their life and their love viable , despite the different directions they would have to go to get where they wanted to be . there was something soap opera like about this tragic love affair that was not only baffling but sad , yet it was more dramatic than that . we weren't overwhelmed by them as stereotypes , forced into accepting them . i think how we accepted them really relates to our life experiences . i know i felt very comfortable with jennifer connelly's performance ; i thought it was subtle , soft-spoken , and unforgettably powerful . it was easy for me to relate to her and what she was about without feeling i was presented with a character who was being foisted on me in a " love story " tear-jerker way . the film was passionate , intelligent , and real . the jennifer connelly character is really the subject of the film and her spirit fills the screen whether she's on it or not . this is because she came across as someone with a real heart and is always haunting us throughout the film because we care about her . we don't really care about him . the two actors were just terrific , giving the story its potency and purpose . 
0	the problem is that people don't care . " if you really don't like it over there , you can come home . " it is quite discombobulating . the rest of the show is a series of adventures that will scare young children and bore most older ones . for a dissenting view , catch jeffrey's opinion at the end . we have people being shot with the resulting bloody wounds , animals caught in vicious traps pulling so hard you think their legs will tear off , people falling off high cliffs , people appearing to drown , etc . the movie is simply one long chase scene filled with dangers . at least it does have the predictably happy ending . the acting by slater is pedestrian and that by lang down right awful . fei demonstrates no acting ability , but ding gives the one compelling performance of the movie . she would be worth seeing again . finally , the two bad guys look and act exactly like the idiotic squat and baboo from " the power rangers . " i think i can handle it . " the star of the show and the only reason to see the movie at all are the pandas . i was once lucky enough to hold a koala in australia , and watching ryan hold a young panda , ryan made me wish i was him . the show does have one sweet scene not involving the pandas . ryan tries to get over the embarrassment by reassuring ling that " i've seen naked ladies before . i have cable tv . " the directing was by christopher cain whose last movie was the next karade kid . cain has no visible talent . given the intrinsic beauty of china , i thought the cinematography ( jack green ) was surprisingly straightforward . there is one good thing about the amazing panda adventure other than the pandas - it starts with a fun cartoon geared to the adults in the audience . the cartoon is entitled cartoonblanca and is a direct takeoff on casablanca . this one , of course , has a happy ending since it is a cartoon after all . the amazing panda adventure runs too long at 1 : 30 . it is rated pg for many violent scenes that will frighten kids under 5 or 6 . if you like pandas , turn on the discovery channel instead of seeing this movie . my incredibly agreeable son jeffrey , age 6 1/2 , gives the movie the movie a thumbs up and a thumbs sideways . i give the show * for the one sweet scene involving people and all of the panda shots . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : october 1 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	the naive ? ngela wonders , at first , could a film such as this cause a heart attack for the viewer . chema recognizes that it is a digital camera xt-500 used , by noting the grainy quality of the film . he also chides ? ngela for being so aloof , for not learning much in film school and for not being able to observe the minute details in filmmaking . he feels rejected by her lack of attention to him , and even asks her why don't you like me , i have money , too ! he proclaims that film directors have to make violent films to please the public , and that they have every right to . what the 22-year-old director , amen ? bar , is trying to do , is show that the public is hypocritical in its condemnation of porn/gore films , because these films wouldn't be made if there wasn't such a tremendous market for them . chema says that the police don't like him and that there is no proof . her lone investigation was too much to believe , that for someone as smart as she is , to make herself so vulnerable didn't seem likely . this slick suspense story works very well on capturing her fear and following the trail to the killer , but fails to be convincing in showing how the public's prurient interest in violent smut is the reason filmmaker's make such degrading films . the young director has an exciting way of filming and keeping one engrossed in the story , thereby achieving a very curious fantasy film , one that is filled with many psychological overtones , but it is derivative film and can't lay claim for being original . 
2	screenplay : todd solondz . director : todd solondz . actually , she may be more typical , which is to say more miserable . well , welcome to the dollhouse , todd solondz's brutally funny portrait of the nightmare that is adolescence . it should be made perfectly clear that welcome to the dollhouse is not , in that favored film terminology , a " coming-of-age " story . no one becomes an adult at 11 , and while solondz features such rites of passage as dawn's first big crush and first kiss , she learns no great truths about life . no , welcome to the dollhouse is about a much more basic truth -- that there is no more unpleasant time in a human life than the middle school years . welcome to the dollhouse is an episodic story which follows dawn through several weeks of her seventh-grade year , and some of those episodes are so perfectly handled that they are painful to watch . it is surprising that solondz has captured the world of a young girl with such detail , but he is dealing with a time where the horrors of unpopularity are very similar between the genders , and where knowledge about sex is still too abstract to make the psychology of adolescence completely different . the fact that she _is_ a girl simply allowed heather matarazzo to nail the part with a startling willingness to look completely homely , and to be less than heroic . the magic of matarazzo's performance is that we feel for her not because she is better than those who torment her , but because her fate is so familiar . when solondz does stumble , it is because he tries to move beyond the simple truths of dawn's life to big-picture issues , or to give his story an artificial sense of resolution . the old saying that comedy is simply tragedy plus time is most certainly true when it comes to adolescence , and welcome to the dollhouse is a winning portrait of the only story that matters when you are eleven years old and different : getting out alive . 
1	the energy and vitality of these musical scores and a host of bizarrely dressed supporting performers who fill the stage with song and dance , gives this film a comical circus flavoring , which manages to cover-up its clich ? -ridden story as much as possible . it's directed with an eye for color , especially the color of rouge , by the pop-musical enthusiast , the australian , baz luhrmann ( " romeo and juliet " / " strictly ballroom " ) , an mtv type of director , who is more interested at getting at what dazzles than the why of the dazzle . the film is a series of perpetual motion shots , never pausing to delve into any character study . the problem with that , is you don't really care what happens to the lovers . the spectacle of the film is the only substance offered , and its made sumptuously beautiful for the eye to feast on . what excuses this film from being such a rip-off of other films , is that what is stolen from other films works very well here . it gives the film all the breathless moments found in other films a chance to breath again in this whirlwind of a production that is in a constant climax mode . if all it took was energy and beautiful sets and costumes , then this production would be a glorious one ; but , what this film didn't have was a love story that could touch the heart , even as it screamed out that it was all about heart . this is an easy movie to praise for being inventive and diverting , but it cannot be admired for a film that has a semblance of truth about it . it's just another enjoyable but forgettable hollywood musical , in a long chorus line of such ventures . the film has the feel in all its excesses of a ken russell type of musical crossed with any number of hollywood ones , even such an illustrious traditional one as " singing in the rain . " the wealthy duke is the heavy in this film . he is played by richard roxburgh , who plays the one-dimensional role as tritely as it is written . the film's gimmick is having 20th century musical songs and routines , that are eye popping , fill this 19th century set musical . they range from songs such as : " the sound of music , " " your song , " " diamonds are a girl's best friend , " " material girl , " " smells like teen spirit , " " like a virgin , " " lady marmalade , " " silly love songs , " " all you need is love , " " up where we belong , " " don't leave me this way , " " heroes , " " in the name of love , " and " roxanne . " this is just a partial list of songs , as the stage is always tuned for some song and dance action . all the main characters played are the usual stock archetypes--nicole kidman was eye catching as the nightclub star and courtesan who is really a sweetie for a whore , but she was too physically big to be handled in a believable way by ewan mcgregor . i was amused by john leguizamo as the rascal-like toulouse-lautrec , and jim broadbent was overpowering in his role as ringmaster of this operation . he seems to be much too stagy a thespian for these more profane hollywood actors he's surrounded by , as he stood out from them because either he was a much better actor than they were or because he hammed it up too much . in any case , his performance did stick out like someone who is thumbing a ride back to topsy-turvy . yet i felt myself partial to his performance , as in every scene he was in i couldn't help being overwhelmed by his strong presence ; though , kidman's performance was the key one of the film . she handles her part in an admirable way , showing us a lot of leg and feeling for who she was ; but , the love story had no sparks and just didn't work right . it's a film that looked good ( lots of garish colors and stardust ) , sounded fine , and felt so-so . a great escape film in the tradition of hollywood spectacles , a film that does justice to the cancan dancers of the moulin rouge . it's a fun film to let one's hair down , to sit leisurely back with some popcorn and watch this film speed across the screen ; while , from time to time peeking in on the jewel-encrusted elephant that goes for satine's boudoir , or checking in on mcgregor's impoverished artist's digs as he slaves over the typewriter with an outside neon sign shining throughout the night ( speaking of clich ? s ) . 
2	although it may have been a more naive era , it was one brimming with sexual curiosity . the sets , the cars , the costumes , everything about the production is authentically nostalgic . he vows to one and all that this summer he is " going to see two people 'doing it' -- no matter what ! " but back then , the mere vicarious pleasure of witnessing sex provided more titillation than a young teen could even imagine . no , it's not at all what you think . it turns out to be something akin to a sex education class , but run by students , that is decades ahead of its time . it is " like a wrestling match on tv , but they're not two men and it's not tv . " well , that certainly explains it all . there is no one whom he would rather catch in the act of doing it than the gorgeous and affable hedy . it is rated r for sexual content and language and would be acceptable for teenagers . 
1	director : paul schrader . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 114 minutes . schrader forgot those things while adapting russell banks' affliction . working with all the elements for a raw dramatic masterwork , he appears unclear how to tell the story through to its conclusion . and in a fit of panic , he turns the final minutes of the film into a mess of ham-fisted plot summary and perplexing epilogue . it's a crying shame , because the set-up for affliction is so utterly compelling . the heart , soul and twisted guts of affliction lie in nick nolte's performance as wade , as beaten-down a human being as the screen has ever seen without turning him into a " lovable loser . " initially , the narration is simply florid and unnecessary ; later , it begins to repeat entire scenes just completed , as though afraid we might have just walked in from the lobby and missed something . finally , the narration becomes absolutely insufferable , summing up every theme from the previous two hours in a few tidy sentences that makes you wonder why you spent your time with wade instead of his self-appointed shrink . that narration is part of an attrocious conclusion that nearly ruins the film , tagging on explanations of much that has gone before and some that comes after . either schrader ran out of money to show us all this significant material , or he ran out of ideas regarding how to do it . perhaps such a gaping hole in the resolution of the protagonist's story should have ruined the film , but there's too much else that works in affliction . cinematographer paul sarossy , who captured russell banks' winter mindscapes previously in the sweet hereafter , captures a sense of chilly isolation , and the supporting cast -- notably coburn's casually emasculating turn as pop -- is solid top to bottom . there's an ache at the core of affliction as painful as the rotting tooth that , in a shakespearean display of psychic corruption manifested through physical corruption , torments wade through much of the film . there will also be an ache in the head of many viewers , as schrader spends the film's critical final minutes beating them with a moral to the story that anyone able to add single-digit numbers should comprehend unassisted . it may have worked for travis bickle , but here schrader's use of narration nearly trumps nolte's triumph . it's enough to make an edgy critic ask , " are you _still_ talkin' to me ?

2	for what it's worth , i correctly guessed the identity of the killer in scream 2 . . . well , sort of . i suppose i should feel satisfied at my own cleverness , since dimension and the makers of scream 2 have put so much effort into keeping that piece of information secret . even more so than in the original scream , writer kevin williamson goes to ridiculous extremes to keep the audience guessing whodunnit , so ridiculous that the film becomes too focused on the one thing which should have been least important . as a horror film , it's a solid piece of work ; as a satire , it's frequently hilarious . as a mystery , it tries way , way , _way_ too hard . jermaine ? marlon ? tito ? if you can keep the suspects straight without a press kit , more power to you . williamson often seems so concerned with turning every live body in sight into a potential suspect that he lets that question overwhelm everything else . it all builds to a revelatory climax drawn out so long past the point of diminishing returns -- loaded with confessions , motives and false finishes -- that you can't even see the point of diminishing returns from there . i'm being a bit harder on scream 2 than it might deserve , because that one big problem may be the only real problem . williamson's satirical darts are expertly targeted , not just at horror film cliches or the " inevitable inferiority " of sequels , but at the original film itself . the film-within-a-film " stab " provides a few wonderful moments , as do the audience reactions to some of the more improbable situations ( e . g . the dialogue is sharp , smart and not at all afraid of naming names ( cox's " friends " co-stars david schwimmer and jennifer aniston are among those skewered ) , a perfect counter-point to wes craven's crafty suspense scenes . if you're not ready to crawl out of your skin when campbell crawls across the unconscious form of her tormentor , it's time for a pulse check . scream 2 is so entertaining both as a chiller and as a chuckler that the lack of attention to those elements is a frustration . kevin williamson is carving out a new genre for himself which certainly seems to be finding an audience -- both screams and i know what you did last summer take off with the radical notion that umasking the monster is a good idea . there's just something deflating about a tense , comic horror film that turns into a scooby-doo episode . williamson has too much talent as a writer of comedy to keep getting side-tracked by conventions , even if they're conventions he's helping to re-create . scare us or make us laugh . . . we know you can do both . just keep the mystery machine parked at the curb . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
0	mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes , nudity ) running time : 121 minutes . adding delilah to the mix certainly adds some spice to the second-chance romance story line , particularly with goldberg in the role . sure , goldberg is doing little more than an extended funky-sassy miss thang riff , but she's always fun to watch , timing her salacious or sarcastic comments impeccably . instead of the novel's hyper-introspective first person narrative , stella on screen offers a bit more interplay , and a bit more fun . so much for the short-term benefit . as talented and forceful an actor as angela bassett can be , she plays stella with too much exuberant confidence . delilah's influence is pervasive as the relationship blossoms ; the bump-n-grind stella we see in jamaica appears to have far too much groove still in her to need getting any of it back . the combination of unfocused motivations and little comic relief proves fatal in the film's final 45 minutes , when it becomes a genuine butt-numbing ordeal . the story simply has nowhere left to go but around in circles : there's some relationship talk , a bit of romance , tense moments , and more relationship talk , all of it surrounding a relationship with not nearly enough chemistry to be involving . newcomer taye diggs , doing a barely serviceable jamaican accent , has all the boyish charm the role needs with about a tenth of the mature-beyond-his-years wisdom it requires . that leaves a whole lot of grating will-they-or-won't-they vacillation over a pairing that , on screen , doesn't make much sense . bass and mcmillan seemed to realize that the very internalized nature of how stella got her groove back required something different to work as a film . the big change they made had it heading in the right direction , but it only emphasized how truly un-cinematic the rest of the story could be . whoopi goldberg may chew up the lovely island scenery , but at least she presents something worth holding your attention for an hour or so . she also makes the rest of the film look like it's about a different kind of groove : the run-out groove . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
2	director : david lynch . mpaa rating : g ( mild profanity ) running time : 111 minutes . in most exceptional films , there is a moment early on when you can just tell you're tapped into something special . where we see alvin's puttering rig about 100 yards from where we last saw it . i think that shot might have been one of the best of the year even if its only purpose had been as a shaggy dog joke . but it's more than that ; it's a remarkably efficient tone-setter . instantly , you know this is going to be a rather unique travelogue . you can begin to appreciate the truly inspired combination of freddie francis's cinematography and angelo badalamenti's fiddle-and-guitar road music that makes the straight story so evocative in its heartland sincerity . and you understand that slow , methodical persistence is central to this story's success -- not just in alvin's journey , but in lynch's willingness to ask his audience for some patience as the film unfolds . if you're busy rubbing your eyes incredulously , wondering if we could possibly be talking about the same david lynch who made " twin peaks , " blue velvet and lost highway , let me assure you that we are . we're also talking about the same david lynch who made the elephant man , another fact-based story overflowing with compassion and humanity . there may be something about working from real life that keeps lynch anchored , and it's a style that suits him well . as provocative as his more surreal films have been , they can make it difficult to appreciate what a talented director he is between the cringes and the head-scratching . in the straight story , he is more in command of his simple visual storytelling than he has ever been , which is not necessarily saying that the straight story is his best film . it's simply obvious , with none of the grotesquerie characteristic of other lynch films , that he knows exactly what works for any given story . he also knows that the straight story is more than a bunch of pretty pictures of the american midwest . richard farnsworth's performance is so low-key and naturalistic that it may not seem there's a lot going on , but alvin straight is a superbly crafted character . senior citizens rarely get the kind of showcase the straight story provides , and farnsworth does beautiful things with alvin . farnsworth does a fine job of pulling all possible sanctimony out of those scenes , but the film is still stronger when it's quiet and observant , soaring on the skills of francis and badalamenti . there's also a sly sense of humor to the straight story , including lynch's ability to poke fun at himself . it's exactly the kind of scene where lynch might have dipped into the creatures beneath the green lawn , or found some other bit of suburban horror . in the striaght story , he just tells a straight story , finding poetry in the simple reliability of a lawnmower's slow , steady journey . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	how whimsical and amusing does a film need to be before it ceases to matter that it lacks a center -- not just that its center is slight , but that it has no center whatsoever ? such a question plagued me at the end of saving grace , a comedy with that uniquely british quirky appeal . it was a pleasant enough experience for most of its running time , but what in the world was the point ? there are certain kinds of comedies that can get away with a complete lack of an identifiably human character arc . this doesn't seem like it should be one of them . how does one reconcile 90 minutes of grins with the nagging impression that the script was in some ways terribly sloppy ? perhaps the best course of action is simply to roll with it . from the outset , saving grace seems to have nearly every element in place for a wonderfully entertaining piece of middle-brow humor . blethyn anchors the film with a performance that's more restrained than recent outings like little voice , effectively playing incongruous moments like her attempts to sell her product on the streets of london while dressed like the queen mum . perhaps most refreshing , there's an unapologetic quality to the film's just-say-yes story line . it's all quite a bit of silly fun for those with no moral objections , until saving grace winds to its conclusion and it becomes evident that there's something missing -- namely , a third act . but saving grace doesn't bother with developing its characters . grace doesn't appear to grow or learn much of anything , and matthew's change of heart is tacked on almost as an afterthought . there's no sense of consequence anchoring anything that goes on in saving grace , like the unemployed full monty crew's search for a renewed sense of their manhood . it all begins to seem like little more than an excuse on which to hang a bunch of jokes about giggle fits . it would feel like a complete violation of grace's character , if not for the fact that grace's character isn't developed carefully enough for there to be that much violation . such carelessness should be enough to sink a frothy enterprise like saving grace , but somehow it doesn't quite . too many of the quirks work , and too many of the giggle fits inspire similar reactions from the audience . it's no masterwork of comic craftsmanship , but it does the job of taking you somewhere goofy and free of responsibility even though you know it's not particularly good for you . and maybe that's a fitting quality for a film about unapologetic pot smokers . ninety minutes of grins sounds about right . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
0	hollywood loves to remake popular shows . when it is too soon to do a remake , it likes to take a recent movie and reconstitute it with slightly different ingredients . in director james foley's fear , not to be confused with gregory hoblit's excellent primal fear , writers christopher crowe and james foley take fatal attraction and repackage it with teenager lovers rather than adults and hope for an instant hit . the romantic obsession part works marginally well , but the film's commentary on teenagers and their relationships with their parents is insightful and worth hearing . the huge downfall in the picture , is that the writers run out of ideas , so they transform the last thirty minutes of the film into a bad , tasteless , and frightening horror flick . most horror pictures you can ignore because they are so hokey and unbelievable , but the tolerably good first part of the film sets you up to care about the people in fear so the ending is much more disturbing that any unrealistic blood and gore film would be . it gives you premature wrinkles . " the film does a good job of showing what can happen to a girl devoid of morals like margo . i need you . you're my only friend . " the audience is provided with both views . one of main ingredients of the film is the massive musical overscoring by carter burwell . the film reminds you of those cars that drive down your street with zillion watt amps that rattle your prized china so that you think it will all break . the sound is so loud you almost need ear plugs and turning it down would not have been possible since other parts of the film are quite soft . moreover , the music is so overly dramatic in parts as to be ridiculous . the film is correctly rated r for gory and frightening violence , animal mutilation , crack smoking , some bad language , a little sex , but no nudity . the horrific images are enough to give you nightmares for a week . on the good side , i must be honest that the movie does feature a genuinely erotic roller coaster ride . given the threatening level of violence against teens and their parents i would recommend that no teenagers see this film although with the teen heartthrob stars in it , i am sure they will . there were certainly a lot of them in the audience . based on the first part of the film i was leaning toward a mild thumbs up for what the movie said about the problems of teens and of relationships with their parents , but after the ending , i can not recommend it to anyone , and i wish i had never ever seen it . disturbing . for the good first part , i am giving it overall a * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	and she didn't just say it , she almost panted it . wearing a tight , low-cut pastel sweater , she was not a woman you'd want to refuse . watch out for people with such false modesty . ) well not exactly . but , as the press notes aptly say , " nothing is 'that' easy . " set in the bright florida sun , palmetto may not look like a film noir , but it is firmly routed in that genre . frequent thunder without rain means the characters sweat profusely in the thick humidity . although several of the plot elements are easy to predict , many aren't . the excellent actor woody harrelson gives a surprisingly self-controlled and almost pensive performance . ( " i was in it right up to my ears , and no idea how i was going to get myself out . " ) woody takes a more subtle approach to the role that he typically has to others . the result is a character who seems quite genuine . " i tried writing but nothing comes out , " harry tells us in voice-over . " there's nothing worse than a writer who has nothing to say . " well screenwriter e . max frye's adaptation of james hadley chase's novel , " just another sucker , " has a lot to say . although little of it breaks any new ground , the movie by german director volker schlondorff thoroughly entertains . you won't feel cheated like harry . and you'll get your money's worth as the twists and surprises accelerate as the movie races to its conclusion . palmetto runs 1 : 52 . it is rated r for sex , violence and profanity and would be fine for mature teenagers . 
2	this is not a sentimental film neither is it ever manipulative . it records the history in a stark , but effective and factual retelling . in this more complete rendition , anne comes alive as much more human and her death even more tragic . the story is told chronologically , and there is as much time devoted to the periods before and after the diary as to the diary period itself . the great shakespearean actor and director kenneth branagh does the narration . he delivers his lines with little emotion , but much impact . this is one of many passages in the film that speaks to all of us today . do we really know our kids ? anne comes alive in the film as a energetic girl who was somewhat of the class clown . anne confides in one section that , " they keep telling me i should talk less and mind my own business , but i seemed doomed to failure . " i have to be my own mother . " the initial publication of anne's diary had little impact , but eventually its fame grew , and it was translated into hundreds of languages and made into a play and then into many different movies , the first and most famous movie version being george stevens's 1959 one . there is actually little to see there and yet , no one will leave the place untouched . this movie will stay with me as it will anyone lucky enough to see it . a brilliant piece of cinematic art , and one incredible story . this review has only barely touched the surface of all that is revealed in the film . even if you think you know it all , this film will be a revelation to you . anne frank remembered runs a fast 2 : 02 , and i would not want a minute of it cut . the film is rated pg because of the horrors it discusses . there is little of the emaciated or dying people in concentration camp scenes so i think there is not much visually to shock young viewers . any kid old enough to consider the subject matter could see the film , and my guess is that means anyone over 8 . i give this film my strongest recommendation possible , and i believe the world would be a better place if everyone saw it . i give it * * * * for being a perfect movie . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	dangerous beauty is a lavish historical melodrama that has enough suds , sex , and flashes of flesh to appeal to soap opera-lovers and enough substance to attract those of a more intellectual bent . however , while the movie does more than pay lip service to themes of female empowerment and religious intolerance , the main focus is the kind of hopeless , star-crossed romance that gave wings of the dove flight . that appellation was dropped for fear that audiences wouldn't know what it meant . however , not only is the honest courtesan a more apt title , but it's a more provocative one . the words " dangerous beauty " mean very little , especially in connection with this film . in fact , a name like this sounds more apropos for a soft-core exploitation flick than a sumptuous tale of late-16th century venice . the time of dangerous beauty is the era in which shakespeare lived and thrived , and the region of the world in which this story transpires was one of the bard's favorite locales . as in many of shakespeare's plays , the film makers have elected to have english-speaking actors play italian characters . what's more , there are no silly accents . and , although the dialogue sounds more contemporary than archaic , the costumes , set design , and attitudes of the characters serve as powerful reminders that this is an historical tale . marriage had nothing to do with love -- it was a contract made based exclusively on considerations of wealth and position . the actress has a wonderfully expressive face and is capable of flowing effortlessly from an almost-comic portrayal to a more serious one . one of dangerous beauty's subtle treasures is the top-notch supporting cast . the actors , like the story , are helped immeasurably by the film's look . visually , this is a gorgeous motion picture . cinematographer bojan bazelli's camera loves the streets and canals of venice , making the city as much a character as any of the people . filters only enhance the beauty . using bazelli's photography as a catalyst , herskovitz creates the perfect tone -- one that is often serious , but occasionally playful , and where serenity can be suddenly interrupted by a burst of passion . as is the case with too many melodramas designed to give the audience a triumphant rush , dangerous beauty goes over the top in its closing moments , offering speech-making and grandstanding that undercuts some of the film's drama . still , it's hard to argue that , contrived as it may be , there's something satisfying about the way things wrap up . a " commercial " finale isn't the worst thing that could happen in a picture like this -- it may be emotionally manipulative , but , on a certain level , it works . dangerous beauty isn't great art , but it is good entertainment . - ingmar bergman 
0	you especially want to praise popular movies , and most of all you want to save your highest rating for cult pictures with strong and vociferous followings . nothing like grade inflation and ignoring your instincts for making your own life more bearable . i consistently ignore this rule . i am generally in the mainstream of reviewers , but when i can not stomach a show as i couldn't in trainspotting i say so knowing full well i will get complaints . less than full honesty isn't fair to my readers . its coming to america has been perhaps the cinematic art house event of the year . for my money , shallow grave , flaws and all , is a much better film than trainspotting . mainly trainspotting focuses on the camaraderie of the druggies and of their humor . the ongoing joke has them trying just hard enough to get a job so they don't get kicked off the dole , but being sure that they are so repulsive that no one will actually hire them . the dialog by john hodge and based on irvine walsh's novel has many funny lines . if the images were not so horrible , perhaps i could have enjoyed them . choose your future . but why would anyone want to do a thing like that ? " most of the humor is visual with a subtext of isn't addition fun and funny at the same time . this makes for a hard to watch film , which isn't necessarily bad . i enjoyed harold and maude about suicide and a lot of other films with shocking subjects , but in trainspotting the filmmakers are so far over the line , that i could not like the picture no matter how hard i tried . i kept thinking to myself , what is next ? are we going to have a comedy full of realist images about how much fun it was to gas people in world war ii ? let me give you two typical scenes and then i will be done with this review . the lingering camera makes sure you see in detail the feces dripping down each of their faces . never in your worst nightmare have you seen such a filthy place . trainspotting runs 1 : 33 . it is rated r , but why it is not nc-17 is beyond me . in addition to the frequent heroin usage scenes , there is violence , constant foul language , sex , and full male and female frontal nudity . since the mpaa gave this film an r , they might as well just retire the nc-17 rating . i strongly recommend that teenagers not see this film at all . for adults , i will grant you that the show is imaginative and the dialog sharp , but i can not recommend this painful show to anyone . for a show i truly hated , i still will give it * 1/2 for the high energy and the clever albeit unbearable script . as it is , i feel like i am being ridiculously generous to the film . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	enjoy the moment for this is about as funny as nick gomez's drowning mona ever gets . meant to be an agatha christie style mystery , the movie is constructed as a series of loosely-connected vignettes , frequently told in flashback and without much narrative drive or momentum . sometimes cute , the film has trouble ever working up to funny . jeff claims that his mom suffered from a " personality disorder " -- not exactly an original line . the running sight gag with him , not that it's funny , is his stump in place of a hand . although wyatt seems rather lackadaisically to be trying to solve the crime , others show no interest whatsoever . as wyatt's deputy ( peter dobson ) succinctly puts it , " ding , dong the witch is dead -- end of story . " like a firecracker that's packed with powerful ingredients but ends up just fizzling , the movie spurts along until the killer is rather arbitrarily chosen -- something that could be said of neve campbell's last picture ( scream 3 ) . have you ever wished that movies featuring a large cast would have everyone wear name tags so that you could remember the names ? most of the characters have their names on the vanity plates on their yugos . cute , huh ? it is rated pg-13 for some thematic elements , language and brief sexuality and would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up . 
1	it is noted for the understated but tense performance by anthony perkins and the electric and a very passionate performance by geraldine chaplin , where you can actually feel her pain and sympathize with her even though she's the aggressor . setting the dark and torturous mood with her soundtrack is alberta hunter's most appealing blues score , which she also performs . tak fujimoto's camera is sharp in its character delineation , cutting deeply into this tale of revenge with its powerful close-ups . a sense of foreboding violence and a quirky sense of humor go very well together in this film , as emily has this crazed and confused look about her and speaks in an unnatural almost comical tone , as if she forgot how to speak and is learning it anew . she succeeds in messing with neil's life and gains the viewer's sympathy , as she seems to be more of a victim than at first thought . the irony in it , is all the main characters watch the news report , but it is too impersonal for them to even react to it , they are too overwhelmed with the problems in their personal life to care about anyone else . i remembered emily's name by the time the film ended , and felt moved by her strained performance and all the emotions , pathos , and humor that was in it . the film was too arty at times , as is the want of the director , but it is a gripping film , one that i recommend for the way it outstandingly depicts the subtleties in the way the characters act . 
0	starring : donald sutherland , amy irving , rider strong , graham greene , christopher mcdonald director : jonathan heap producers : michael spielberg and brad m . gilbert screenplay : jeffrey polman and christopher keyser from a story by michael lieber music : gary denton released by miramax films sounds like a pretty good basis for a psychological thriller/drama , right ? the premise is good and , given a well-written script , the execution could have produced a memorable film . however , somewhere before the midpoint of this movie , things go so badly wrong that benefit of the doubt collapses , changing from an intriguing motion picture into a formula-riddled , ghoulish disaster . usually , it's up to independent movie distributors like miramax to give us unique thrillers ( such as the crying game ) . however , in this case , miramax has reached into its grab-bag and drawn out something that couldn't possibly be any more hollywood-like . with little to claim in the way of originality ( except perhaps the setup ) , benefit of the doubt is a cross of a number of recent thrillers . the most obvious source material comes from the stepfather , which is ripped off shamelessly and ineffectively . exactly who is the intended audience for this movie ? simply put , the picture involves a lot of the murder and exploitation that appeals to mass audiences , but there are too many slow-moving sequences to effectively draw from that portion of the film-going population . also , benefit of the doubt is opening in a small number of " select " theaters including , of all places , several " art houses " . this is definitely not a picture for the viewers who frequent those venues . from a certain point , benefit of the doubt gets continuously worse . once it starts down the slippery track of cinematic ugliness , it seems to embrace the descent . plot twists cease to make sense , characters lose the tentative three-dimensionality they had been striving for , and the audience stops caring about what's going on . amy irving , hardly looking like herself with straight blonde hair , gives a reasonably effective performance , but eventually the script and dialogue get the better of her . similarly , donald sutherland starts out strong , but as the plot grows progressively more ridiculous , his part becomes flat . graham greene is uniformly unimpressive in a role that is completely superfluous . so much running back and forth goes on that it's impossible not to get an eyefull of the sand , buttes , and canyons . unfortunately , as the movie progresses , the scenery becomes far more interesting than a story that becomes as ridiculous as it is predictable . 
0	a mystery thriller from the pen of daphne du maurier , tepidly adapted to the screen from gore vidal's murky script in a workman-like way by robert hamer . it's a one-idea film and that idea is unable to dispel all the holes in the blurry plot , even though it is well-acted . it is a dual role he plays admirably , but he does not leave any lasting impression in either part . the surprise ending was predictable and did not help salvage this rather dry film . the film's main fault was that it failed to maintain a level of tension for its mystery story , and the three weeks that barratt played at being a french nobleman was hardly believable . this is a good story as written for a book , but it was not filmed with any verve . the middle part of it seemed to be going nowhere and by the time the payoff came , the confrontation between the morally concerned barratt and the villainous count , seemed too artificial and lifeless for me to give its supposedly shocking outcome a second thought . 
2	this odets' work was originally performed as a neo-realist broadway play in 1941 , with tallulah bankhead in the stanwyck role . she can't resist anymore and tries to make a relationship with earl work , fed-up that jerry is so dull . the performances are stagy but filled with fiery emotion . everything about these characters and their alienation seemed natural , something that was grounded by lang's showing them at work , never cutting them off from all the travails they were going through just to exist . it's a film that reminded me of how easy it is , not to see the faults in yourself as easy as it is too see it in someone else . 
2	mrs . brown is a love story much in the same vein as carrington in that it deals with platonic affection that runs deeper and truer than that of the motion picture staple romantic variety . these days , it seems that whenever we see a male/female friendship on screen , it's just a setup for the inevitable moment when the two realize that they're fated to be lovers . brown , one of the most emotionally sensitive and intelligent love stories of the year . it shows , amongst other things , that it's possible to love completely and with unflagging devotion without sex ever becoming an issue . it's posonby's hope that brown will " appeal to the queen's sentimental belief that all highlanders are good for the health . " brown arrives and proves to be a breath of fresh air . director john madden so effectively conveys this atmosphere that we become keenly aware of such things as a ticking clock and a cleared throat . nevertheless , her extended period of mourning , during which she has been out of the public's sight , has created a great deal of uncertainty among her subjects , and parliament is beginning to discuss the possibility of disestablishing the monarchy -- a prospect that horrifies disraeli and prince edward . both actors immerse themselves in their roles , playing brown and the queen without a hint of artifice , and the chemistry between them is palpable . theirs is a wonderfully real relationship that is reminiscent of the one between lytton strachey and the title character of carrington . perhaps the best thing of all about mrs . brown is that it doesn't offer any hokey , hollywood-type moments . the picture remains true to itself throughout , affirming that film maker john madden ( ethan frome ) has a keen insight into the human psyche . brown is a fascinating character study , a wonderful love story , and a brilliant period piece ( masterpiece theater and the bbc , both renowned for their costume dramas , are listed as co-producers ) . in a summer that is sure to be glutted with formulaic action thrillers and flat romantic comedies , mrs . brown will delight and touch any viewer who seeks it out . 
0	this film is all style and is non-judgmental in its observations , adding nothing more of subtance to the story than the inertia that is depicted . there is violence everywhere in this stupid household . the film had realistic performances from its leads and had a gritty look to it . but the story flattened out and with violence being the loudest emotion expressed by anyone in this loser's family , the story predictably ends on a very violent note . the film makes no comments about the conditions of a society that helped bring about such anti-social behavior and what circumstances kept the family incapicitated . this first feature by woods , based on a work that was presented on stage , had its powerful moments , making a strong case about how male insecurity and violence are so closely linked . but the film couldn't get further into its subjects than to expose the boys' surface wounds and their bleak story about their frustrations to deal with life , as the story just went nowhere but down a predictable violent path . it left the implication that society better be prepared to build more jails or else , implying that there is no way to help a family that won't even lift a finger to help itself . 
1	nicholas meyer , a talented writer/director who likes developing interesting characters and situations out of genre types ( the seven per cent solution , star trek iv : the voyage home ) , made his directorial debut with 1979's time after time . unfortunately , while this science fiction/thriller has a premise with tremendous promise , the execution is hampered by obvious plot holes , inconsistent characters , and uneven acting . despite all its flaws , however , time after time still remains an entertaining--and occasionally fascinating--two hours , as well as a favorite among meyer fans . it's amusing to see wells cope with modern-day traffic patterns , television , and fast food restaurants . in fact , his pursuit of the ripper is often far less engaging than watching him struggle to understand the complexities of life in the late '70s . while mcdowell is fine as wells , david warner plays the ripper as a run-of-the-mill psychopath--not at all the sort of fascinating , diabolical villain necessary to keep this film moving . all things considered , jack is more likely to provoke a yawn than a surge of terror . meyer's script distances him from us so that we never feel anything particularly strong for or against him . despite a certain charm and appeal , mary steenburgen , in one of her early roles , is awkward as amy . this character is supposed to be a smart , assertive , liberated woman , yet the story continually places her in contrived and vulnerable positions . at times , her actions are more like those of a typical female victim in a slasher movie than a heroine worthy of h . g . wells' attention . there are a lot of nice touches in time after time , but the overall plot is too obviously scripted . when a certain element in the time machine's construction is carefully pointed out twice , we know it's going to become important . this sort of thing happens repreatedly in time after time--unsubtle hints at what's coming next . fortunately , in future features , meyer's direction would lose much of that heavy- handedness . it's more of a lighthearted fantasy/romance with a few thriller elements thrown in . indeed , the movie might have worked better had jack the ripper not been around at all . alas , he is the engine that keeps the plot moving , and there are times when his very presence weighs down this movie like a proverbial albatross . 
2	the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and " real " movies . top-flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety . based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks , the movie represents a rethinking of the story's structure , not merely a literal adaptation of the novel . told in linear form by four narrators in the book , egoyan's version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator . periodically throughout the picture , nicole's readings are heard in voice-over . you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment . they and the rest of the town's children come into harm's way -- some live and others are seriously injured . although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children , the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss . ian holm , in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career , plays mitchell stephens , an intense man of quiet misery . if this seems crass , well it is , but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot . each little aspect has its own fascination . his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story . the accident itself , a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice , isn't shown until the middle of the picture , but , nevertheless , the mystery about it builds throughout the film . although the picture is no detective story , finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy . mitchell's pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder . ) mychael danna's haunting music sets the stage for tragedy . the cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur , but it is in the warm , shadowy , intimate moments indoors where it works best . the show , which is ripe for emotional manipulation , never plays with its audience . still , when the house lights go up , you may feel as i did . i could barely breathe ; i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed . more than anything , the film is like a master painting . each cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint . with the final color in place , the masterpiece is complete , and the ending credits roll . the sweet hereafter runs 1 : 50 . it is rated r for mature themes , sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers . 
2	it is a small negligence on alice's part not to watch the child for just a few moments , but it has cataclysmic consequences . it tears alice's already miserable life asunder . elliott , who sometimes lets his movie meander , stages the scene of the child's death with particular poignancy . the ending of this scene will literally tear your heart out , and , yet , the way it is presented is completely natural and unmanipulative . no , not about the drowning . this entire episode has chilling parallels with recent , well-publicized cases of massive , false child abuse complaints . weaver , who is in most of the scenes , makes the picture rise above the ordinary . willing to look quite unattractive and to play a remarkably unsympathetic character , she gives a frightening picture of someone on the verge of losing it all in more ways than one . in an otherwise hard hitting film with conspicuous ambiguity , the ending wraps things up a bit too neatly . but after you leave the theater , you'll quickly forget the film's few shortcomings . you'll be thinking instead about weaver's strong performance as a woman on the edge . it is rated r for some sexuality and language and would be fine for most teenagers . 
2	british humor is often at its peak when it mixes droll wit with monty pythonesque weirdness . this certainly isn't the perfect fare for mainstream america , but for those who enjoy a touch of the bizarre with their laughter , leon the pig farmer makes an excellent one-hundred minute diversion . leon the pig farmer is a singularly entertaining motion picture . its co-directors , gary sinyor and vadim jean , have done an excellent job pacing the film ( until the very end , when everything sputters to an abrupt halt ) . the types of humor are spread around evenly , avoiding long periods of stagnation between the funny parts . there are moments guaranteed to bring on bursts of uncontrolled laughter , but more often , leon causes its audience to smile and chuckle--the product of recognizing the clever wit of a situation . there's a substantial dash of the unusual in leon's humor--the sort of material that brings to mind monty python or black adder . the unexpected is often the greatest asset of such comedy--and it's present in abundance . how many times do strangers approach someone to give advice on intimate matters ? as enjoyable as all this zaniness is , there's a none-to-subtle message to go along with it about being true to oneself . the directors don't have an axe to grind , but they offer this for those who want some substance amidst the silliness . the cast contains a number of well-respected british actors , including brian glover and janet suzman . known primarily for dramatic roles , these two give wonderful comic turns , proving that leslie nielsen isn't the only one who can put a staid reputation to good use . maryam d'abo is marvellous as the manic madeleine , and hers is easily the standout performance . mark frankel , who plays leon , sometimes overacts his role ( especially when he's around pigs ) , but he's generally solid and has a good knack for comedy . his performance keeps the film moving , and his chemistry with his two leading ladies ( d'abo and bellman ) is effective . it's easy to see why leon has been such a hit on the film festival circuit over the past year . it's a thoroughly charming movie in the same vein as another little-known british comedy , getting it right ( which is available on video ) . i hadn't initially planned to see this movie ( believe it or not ) , but the positive advance word piqued my curiosity . this is one unexpected trip to the theater that i haven't regretted .

2	some movies shoot for the moon . bond films , on the other hand , have modest , simple aspirations . they are happy just to provide solid entertainment value . and by that metric , the world is not enough , directed by 42 up's michael apted , does exactly what it sets out to do . the most important costars in the bond movies are the spy's toys . these films usually have the audience applauding for the stunts , and this episode of the superspy saga is no different . the best of the bunch in the world is not enough is a sleek , one-man , black boat complete with jet afterburners , which looks like something custom-made for batman . the vehicle even has the ability to dive underwater briefly while the driver holds his breath . it can turn into a car as well , all the better to engage in a typical bond demolition derby . the outcome of a bond movie is never in question , but who cares ? that's not why we're here . we come to have fun and enjoy the action , like the helicopter with a supersized chainsaw attached , which cuts through cars and buildings . bond films always feature beautiful women , and the two this time are among the best of the bond babes . first seen in a tight fitting tank top and brief shorts , she makes science look pretty exciting . " you want to put that into english for those of us who don't speak spy ? " jones mocks bond at one point . the movie is rife with such double-entendres , which delight the older members of the audience while going right over the heads of the younger . the funny script by bruce feirstein , neal purvis , and robert wade is filled with puns and clever little jokes . bond movies don't really have messages . they're happy just to amuse us , which this one does in spades with its great stunts , funny dialog and crisp acting . on the other hand , if we want to go looking for a message , bond himself says it best . now that's something with which viewers of either sex can identify . the world is not enough runs 2 : 08 . it is rated pg-13 for intense sequences of action violence , some sexuality and innuendo and would be acceptable for kids around 10 or 11 and up . my son jeffrey , age 10 , who has seen all but 2 of the bond films , loved this one , giving it * * * * . he especially liked the battles and the boat/sub/car . alan and john complained that there was too much sleeping around . 
2	( many will write this off as a plot device , but since i have one close relative whose family got by with a similar ruse in the great depression , i could identify with their plight . ) the abramowitzs live in squat , ugly , stucco boxes with ironic names like the " casa bella " apartments . it would have been easier to have had murray be unemployed , but the smart script gives murray a job -- user car salesmen -- without the skills to make much money from it . his only daughter , vivian , is the film's central character . " what seems to be the problem ? " she's sure that they are so large that people will laugh at her so breast reduction surgery might be just the answer . vivian , in a delicate , funny , and slightly erotic scene , finds even better uses for the vibrator when rita isn't there . the comedy rarely subsides , and yet the picture is more touching than funny . director jenkins has a deft touch in blending in plenty of humor to keep us interested while she weaves a poignant tale of a struggling family who manage to always keep their heads up and their bags packed . it is rated r for sex , nudity , profanity and drug content , and would be fine for older teenagers . 
1	this italian made western , filmed in spain , began the craze of so-called spaghetti westerns . clint eastwood plays 'the man with no name , ' in the first of the three films made with the same theme ( the others were : " for a few dollars more " ( 65 ) and " the good , the bad , and the ugly " ( 1966 ) ) . the film is a no message one , where violence is glorified by the hero who is as amoral as the villains . this kind of attitude changed the way westerns were made . it's an entertaining film , gore and all , its only drawbacks being the poor dubbing job and that leone hasn't perfected all his moves yet in a smooth way . yet this film , not as rewarding as his others , still has the style of the director's later works , plus the same themes of graphic violence , a laconic hero , and the thrill of gunfights galore . an old bell-ringer tells the newcomer that in this town folks get to be either rich or dead . clint chomps at the end of his cigar without smoking it , says little , wears a mexican poncho , and is always with his trusted . 45s . but this scene was shot in a shoddy way , as it was hard to comprehend that the two gangs were so stupid that they would so easily believe that the stiffs they were fighting over were real . in this western parody , there's some humor behind all the choreographed violence and there's also a passable ennio morricone's score to instill a sense of melodrama . what makes this mythical film noteworthy , is that it serves an historical purpose as the start of a new trend in making westerns . 
1	screenplay : christopher scott cherot . director : christopher scott cherot . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 92 minutes . like other recent indy success stories including the brothers mcmullen and clerks , hav plenty will win admirers for its comic charms and low-budget , can-do enthusiasm , even as detractors line up to fire pot-shots at its gross amateurishness and complete lack of visual style . think of it as puppy cinema : it's so easy to be won over by their cute , slobbery energy that you may overlook how much they need discipline to avoid making a mess time and time again . christopher scott cherot , the multi-hyphenate creator of hav plenty , definitely has the puppy thing down cold . not everyone could get away with a premise that sounds like a film-maker's ego-stroking fantasy . cherot , however , is so unassuming and self-effacing -- and so doncha-just-love-him puppy-cute -- that all the unsolicited romantic advances actually seem like they make him uncomfortable . though far from a polished performer , cherot has a natural screen presence , an eye for wry commentary and the rare ability in the 90s to sell a pratfall . simply put , it's easy to like him , even when the film's narrative gets a little rough around the edges . make that a _lot_ rough around the edges . cherot has a solid enough sense for how to put together a comic scene , but he hasn't got a clue yet how to unite them . hav plenty amounts to little more than a series of vignettes , ideas for character encounters lined up in a row until they add up to 90 minutes . the characters are little more than one-dimensional , occasionally even grotesque caricatures for the deadpan cherot to react to . there are even takes included where the actors clearly fumble their lines . in such a makeshift effort , the sly , slick performance of hill harper stands out as a hilarious delight . playing hav's fiance michael , a criminally insincere r&b star whose song titles involve such romantic analogies as comparing a woman to malt liquor in " love forty , " harper creates one genuinely brilliant scene and one great comic character . that scene and cherot's low-key appeal are enough to push hav plenty over the edge as an entertaining diversion . mostly , however , cherot will earn plaudits for his good intentions -- for making the film nearly as a one-man show , for creating a romantic comedy with smart , upscale african-american characters , etc . hav plenty ends with lee finding success as the " true story " of his relationship with havilland becomes his first film . if cherot wants to find success beyond hav plenty , he'll need to mature as an effective story-teller rather than just an effective joke-teller . a messy puppy may be cute , but all grown up he's just a mess . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
2	cast : matt damon , robin williams , ben affleck , stellan skarsgard , minnie driver , casey affleck , cole hauser director : gus van sant producer : lawrence bender screenplay : matt damon and ben affleck cinematography : jean-yves escoffier music : danny elfman u . s . distributor : miramax films in essence , good will hunting is an ordinary story told well . taken as a whole , there's little that's special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path , leaves the audience with a warm , fuzzy feeling , and never really challenges or surprises us . but it's intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) , strongly directed , and nicely acted . so , while good will hunting is far from a late-year masterpiece , it's a worthwhile sample of entertainment . the formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different . al pacino's slade was a larger-than-life individual ; robin williams' sean mcguire is much more subtle . will is a troubled individual . but he's a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems . the script , by co-stars matt damon and ben affleck , is not a groundbreaking piece of literature , and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation . the characters are well-developed , however , and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles . later , will gives a brilliant , breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith . likewise , the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie's friendship . many of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation , even if the overall story is somewhat generic . minnie driver ( last seen in grosse pointe blank ) adds another strong performance to a growing resume ( and it's refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one ) . the outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams , whose sean is sad and wise , funny and somber . arguably the best dramatic work in the actor's career ( alongside what he did in the fisher king ) , williams' portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination . like most of what comes before it , the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable . but meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren't always bad things in a movie , provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail . good will hunting does both , and , as a result , earns a rating commensurate with the " good " in the title . - ingmar bergman 
0	my first press screening of 1998 and already i've gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list . what an auspicious beginning ! firestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves's academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year's crop of movies . as our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are " smokejumpers . " we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from " cosmopolitan . " when , even in the beginning , the director can't get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble . not bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people . as it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f . windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl's face . most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing . when the film isn't using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey . the ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie . perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , " it's not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . " firestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 . it is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers . 
1	what we get here , however , is often unintentionally closer to monty python and the holy grail's silliness than to excalibur's melodramatic grandeur . bad acting , dumb dialogue , and confusing cinematography abound , creating one of the most shoddy camelot stories to date . what makes first knight seem even worse is that it's up against the vastly superior braveheart , a romantic adventure in very much the same vein , although formed from an entirely different mould . in first knight , we're introduced to king arthur of camelot ( sean connery ) , his intended bride guinevere ( julia ormond ) , and the valiant sir lancelot ( richard gere ) , who apparently is hot for the queen-to-be ( or so the script tells us -- you couldn't tell by gere's acting ) . add to this an idiotic hollywood ending , and first knight turns out to be a mess of the first order . too bad he isn't given more to do than stand around looking regal . then there's richard gere , terribly miscast as lancelot . in fact , it's hard to imagine a less likely figure in the part of this legendary hero , uttering such pretentious lines as " i never believed in anything before , but now i believe in camelot . " at least he spares us an attempt at a bogus british accent . there are the requisite battle sequences which feature huge armies clashing on an open field . filmed with all the coherence of an mtv video , these are prime examples of how not to shoot this sort of scene . maybe zucker should have consulted mel gibson before embarking on this project . the sustained tension of braveheart's battles is in marked contrast to the boredom generated by first knight's . when all is said and done , there's still at least one amazing thing about first knight : after being kidnapped , dragged through a forest , imprisoned , rescued , and nearly drowned , guinevere's lipstick is perfectly intact . that this bit of minutia sticks out so clearly speaks volumes about the dullness of this supposed adventure film . 
2	it number one on my best of the year list for 1989 , but since i wasn't a movie critic then , i never wrote a review of it . truly , he could read the encyclopedia , and people would pay to listen . the secret of this movie is the star , the screenwriter , and the director , namely kenneth branagh . i've thought about what it is that makes his henry v come alive so , and it may come down to the basics . every word is clear and forceful even when he speaks in whispers . most shakespearean actors run through their lines in a blur as if either they have so much to say they have to talk fast or , more likely , they don't fully comprehend them all . branagh gives the impressions that he has been studying the bard's original folios since birth . any film that is smart enough to get simon rattle and the birmingham symphony to do the music has already proven their seriousness of purpose . for those of you not familiar with them , rattle and his orchestra are arguably the best mahlerian interpreters in the music world today . their sounds in the film are full of power and energy that further illuminate and enhance the action . the interior scenes are not only lit strictly with candles , but the light even flickers on the players as real candles would . this all combines to give the king the aura of a god . since i am about branagh's height , i thought , now that's how i'd like to be framed . actually , branagh's physical appearance makes gives him a unique force of presence . his thin lips almost vanish as he speaks which force the viewers attention even more on his words . his facial expressions radiate confidence . you see him , and you believe . branagh , the director , is a master at opening up the bard's plays . the interior scenes are intimate , but it is in the exterior where his directorial genius shines . his outdoor scenes are full of power to complement the words that are spoken . there are also realistic . his battle of agincourt becomes a mud bowl and the march to it even worse . my favorite is dench who steals her scenes with her perky and silly little mannerisms . is not their climate foggy , raw and dull ? " as the battle of agincourt ends , an exhausted henry confesses to the french envoy mountjoy ( christopher ravenscroft ) , " i know not if the day be ours or no . " i could go on and on about this film . the rest of the cast is outstanding . even the small details like the sounds of the rush of the arrows in the battle is impressive . a film to be seen and savored , again and again . it is rated pg for some tastefully done , but realistic war violence . there is no sex , nudity , or bad language . the film would be fine for any kid old enough to be interested in the play . i give the picture my strongest recommendation and rate it * * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	this film has a different look to it , as its color tones are strikingly in browns and soft yellows . they added a touch of black humor . ripstein also has a dizzying amount of extra shots of things that don't play exactly into the story but add some arty points he's trying to make about the outside influences facing the alienated julia . i wasn't enlightened by these unnecessary scenes , in fact i thought they were pretentious . almost the entire film is a boring rant by julia , where a fine actress like arcelia ramirez just over acted and failed to bring the audience over to her side . her classical story didn't play like great drama , but felt more like soap opera or a tragic headline newspaper story one reads these days of a mother snapping and killing her children for no logical reason . all the drama evaporated from this presentation , as the film's reward seemed to be a visual feast of looking at the interior of an apartment situated in an ugly apartment building's courtyard . yet this film shouldn't be totally ignored , as the auteur director took chances with this story and was technically innovative as he gave the film a different look to it . that alone should earn him applause for the effort made . at least , his film wasn't stale as most commercial ventures are today . the overriding fault for this art-house film was that it is not poetic in a story that must be poetic to be felt as drama and not soap opera . it unfortunately comes off as too distant ( it's lost in the mundane world for the answers to julia's problems ) for the viewer to empathize with julia's internal misery . it also suffers from comparison to other medea presentations--so many great versions of it were put on as plays , plus the film versions by pasolini and von trier were far superior . 
2	we need to clear up a widely held misunderstanding . most of you by now are aware that it is a mixture of animation , featuring all your favorite looney tunes characters , and live action , featuring various sports stars from the nba . so far ; so good . now , you are probably under the impression that michael jordan acts in this movie . this is patently false . with the except of a single brief smile , he manages to maintain a dispassionate and deadpan look throughout the picture . more likely , he just can not act -- most of us can't . michael jordan is certainly a great athlete , and he provides a good clean-cut role model for youngsters , but this does not an actor make . the good news is that the cartoon characters in the film are excellent and the story by leonardo benvenuti , timothy harris , steve rudnick , and herschel weingrod is well developed and quite funny . this is one of those rare examples of a good movie with a lead that is doa . until this point the story is little more that a schmaltzy autobiography . never fear , the animated characters are here . the looney tunes challenge the height-challenged aliens to a game of basketball to see whether the tunes have to go to moron mountain or not . ever confident daffy ridicules them with , " too bad you can't practice getting taller , boys . " they then go and suck the talent and stature of various nba heroes which makes the aliens look like major steroid abusers . the picture works as a feature length cartoon . the looney tunes are as funny as i ever remember seeing them . there are constant jokes about product royalties . this " screwed " line is funny , but it is this and a couple of others where the humans talk about getting their " butts whipped " that gets the film a pg rating rather than a g . since there are so few g shows made , it is a shame that the producers went for a more bankable pg picture . yes , there are many teenagers and adults who will not go to g films thinking subconsciously that they are only for little kids , but why do the studios keep pandering to these prejudices ? changing these few lines would not have made the picture one scintilla less funny . all the tunes are hilarious in the show , but daffy is the best mainly because he gets the best material . no one is immune from the jabs in the show . along with the humor , the show is upbeat and full of energy thanks to the strong live action direction by joe pytka and animation direction by bruce smith and tony cervone . here he redeems himself in my eyes . i had great fun watching the film as did my son , my wife , and my 70 year old parents . technically the film is a success as well . the colors are bright primary ones that radiant joy . other than the lifeless lead and the little bit of needless bad language , i think the show is good fun , and i believe your family will too . space jam runs just 1 : 27 , and if you stay until the very end , you will get one last treat on the screen . it is rated pg solely for a few mildly offensive words . there is no sex , nudity , or violence . my son jeffrey , age 7 1/2 , loves the show and gives it " ten thumbs up . " he has a strange scale that i have never quite been able to chart . i recommend this picture to you , especially if you have kids , and i give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	screenplay : w . peter iliff . director : mike robbins . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , nudity , adult themes ) running time : 103 minutes . it would also be inaccurate -- religious faithful generally demonstrate some sense of proportion . a cult would be more analagous , with thousands of people connecting their happiness to the achievements of mere mortals to whom greater powers are ascribed . or perhaps rudimentary tribal warfare is more appropriate . or even basic psychological child abuse . or , varsity blues could be made . as the exceedingly pleasant van der beek plays him , there's never much question at all . he's a broad strokes hero like kilmer -- who's not only a martinet , but a racist just for good measure -- is a broad strokes villain . dramatically , mox is a flatline . that inconsequential plot progression wastes plenty of potentially compelling conflict . the emotional center of varsity blues should have been the pressure and twisted values that make high school kids believe nothing they ever do will be as valuable , a sentiment expressed in kilmer's pep talk that the big game is " 48 minutes for the next 48 years of your lives . " though director brian robbins ( making a dramatic leap from good burger ) nails the atmosphere of abandoned friday night streets , w . peter iliff's script uses it mostly as scenery for a typical teen soap opera . it's worth noting that robbins and ilif include at least a few insightful scenes -- including one player's rage against how much he's always hated the game -- between the obligatory t&a and party-hearty scenes . this isn't the last picture show we're talking about , nor was it ever likely to be , but it could have aimed for something slightly more ambitious than a climax where all that matters is whether the coyotes can win the big game . that's not just uninspired -- given the setting , it's painfully ironic . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
1	what we have , is a very cleverly done film , that is in it for the box-office and as an entertainment only film , and it should accomplish both aims , at least , entertainment wise , it is first-rate . it is a good mindless , violent flick for americans to take their mind off the more serious things occuring at the time this movie opened , such as the political scandal and impeachment hearings involving our prez and his lady intern ( and , you know how serious that stuff was ) . but do remember , the bad hero , is not all that bad , he is mel , the charming hero of countless adventure films , a guy who is full of good looks and charm , someone audiences love to like , and will plunk down their money to see his films in huge numbers . he also does the voice-over ala noir style , in a deep laconic voice , you know , like a sam spade would do it . the voice-over reassured me that he will live through the film ( that's good , because knowing him , he will be in every scene of this flick , and therefore i'm assured that i will be getting my money's worth of mel . you see , i don't really care what happens to his character in this flick , per se , since he is as unreal as the ones you find in the cartoons . what i care about is being entertained , by golly , golly , golly , gee ! ) . payback rips off the way a noir film is shot and looks , ( or maybe , in a certain sense , pays it homage ! ! ! ) and does it with pizzazz . the big city it chooses for its locale is chicago , with its tall buildings and el trains , adding a dark shade to its story . the only thing it fails to pick up from those great b/w films mood pieces of edginess from the 40s and 50s , is that their heroes were really underdogs , they were fighting the system , not out for their own ends and vanity only . this little difference is easy to ignore , but it is bothersome when i see how close mel came to sniffing out the essence of a noir film . but i'm glad to report , ever so close , but no cigar , tough guy . you just can't imitate that secret ingredient without being into the real thing . you were both great to look at on screen , you played your hands well , and most importantly , i enjoyed the film , it had a lightness to it that made it very appealing . needless to say , there was not much to the plot for this stylish film , but for those of you who want to know the story line , this is a pure revenge film . action scenes of this heist are super . this gag lends a much welcomed humor to what could have been just a pointless actioner . at least , the filmmakers are having fun with this one , and it shows . for the remainder of this slick film , porter is either getting beat up or doing the beatings himself . there is plenty of action , so don't worry you don't have to think of anything when you are watching this flick , everything moves at break-neck speed . these filmmakers have a great eye for detail . so , all-in-all , you have a lot of good action scenes going down , a lot of funny one-liners ( i laughed out loud when porter said , if i was any dumber i would have become a cop . you see , porter is acting very dumb going after the mob and its big bosses , kristofferson , coburn , and devane ) . i , especially , liked seeing devane , he is a throwback to the old noir foils . there is also an homage scene or a rip off , which ever you prefer , it doesn't matter to me , when porter rips the earring off a drug dealer's ear , taking a chunk of his ear with it . you can't help remembering roman polansky did that in chinatown , a true modern noir film , a film that caught the essence of that genre . the film works for all the above reasons , and most of all it works , because mel is great for the part . 
2	" you can't believe the relief it was to feel the pain , " danny flynn tells his ex-sweetheart , maggie . daniel day-lewis in another of his meticulous performances plays danny in the boxer . in an underwritten role , she manages to shine with her intensity and sincerity . the chemistry between them is taut and real . a beautiful story with wonderful performances by an ensemble cast , it suffers a single but all-encompassing problem , the over-restrained tone set by the director , jim sheridan . sheridan , whose previous films with daniel day-lewis were my left foot and in the name of the father , normally brings emotional fire to his subjects , but this time he takes a too cerebral approach to the material . you can almost feel him keeping his actors' emotions in check . at certain points in the story , when things are going most awry with danny , the picture comes into its full glory , but at others it just hints at what could have been . sheridan's meticulous staging of the ira activities at the time of a truce has an almost documentary authenticity . harry doesn't trust anyone , least of all someone from the other side offering an olive branch . the result makes for an unglamorized view of the ira's inner workings . a disappointing show but a powerful one without a bad performance in it , it never quite engages the audience . the last third of the story , especially the ending , where things don't go according to plan brings out some of the strong passions that are rarely in evidence in the rest of the picture . even given its flaws , its haunting images are likely to stay with you for a while . it is rated r for violence and profanity and would be fine for teenagers . 
1	a minor noir film , originally made for radio . vince tells him i grew up with you , we took a lot of raps together , and then you turned stool pigeon on me , turning state evidence on me so that you could beat the rap , making me serve a two year sentence for manslaughter . " i should call dr . kemble ! " but kemble is not available . the film's finale is done in grand noir-style , filmed in a santa monica warehouse , where one of vince's flunkies , petey , played by the rotund , minuscule veteran character actor with the high-pitched squeaky voice , percy helton , my all-time favorite bit player , who must have had thousands of uncredited parts in a variety of films . what distinguishes this film as not the normal crime-type of film , with a happy ending , but as a noir-work , is how it captures the changing societal attititudes of the protagonists , who desperately want to fit into postwar american society despite their prior misdeeds . this is seen mainly through the dark los angeles settings depicted by the camerawork of probably the best noir cinematographer ever , john alton , and not through the thin plot structure of the film . what leaves a lasting impression on the viewer , is the warehouse shootout , as we see these antisocial types trapped like rats and how they react . it all seems credible because john payne has the look of someone who has just come out of a laundry washing machine and is now being hung out to dry . 
1	greedy is one of those motion pictures that doesn't quite know what it wants to be . the ending is a complete cop-out , but there are at least enough laughs along the way to make the experience mildly palatable . it's fresh , funny , and delivered with a scathing edge . had director jonathan lynn ( my cousin vinny ) framed the entire movie this way , it's interesting to ponder what the result might have been . there are still laughs to be had , but these form the backdrop for an increasingly ordinary film . the less said about the ending , the better . like the wrap up of another ganz/mandel story , parenthood , greedy's conclusion is too pat--all happy and upbeat . the big " plot twist " is obvious , despite attempts to throw in a red herring or two . some of what happens during the final quarter-hour rivals scent of a woman's finale for mind-numbing , hollywood-style audience manipulation . even though the introduction of michael j . fox's danny signifies the beginning of greedy's decline , the actor acquits himself well . although affable as usual , mr . fox plays his role with a little more spirit than has been evident in some of his recent box-office duds ( the latest of which was the forgettable for love or money ) . kirk douglas is adequate , but the role of joe wouldn't challenge any actor's skills . even late in the film , when the story is on course for its seemingly inevitable conclusion , mr . hartman's presence lends a sarcastic bite to several scenes . during the course of this film , there are quite a few laughs to be had , and if the sole purpose of going to a comedy is for laughter ( irrespective of story content ) , then the movie succeeds . unfortunately , looking beyond the gags and jokes , greedy suffers from a split personality , and the resulting uneven tone can lead to feelings of ambivalence . like the relatives vying for uncle joe's money , greedy tries a little too hard to be likable . 
2	going into selena , i didn't know or care much about the life of the late tex-mex singer , whose death in 1995 came just as she was attempting to break into the mainstream american pop market . as far as i was aware , selena's tragic end was just another minor footnote in music history -- i hadn't heard of her before and i didn't expect to hear of her again . then along came this movie , and , sitting in a darkened theater , watching selena's story unfold , my perceptions changed . i not only cared , but understood a measure of the tragedy that had stricken her fans . it would have been easy to trivialize selena's story , turning it into a sudsy , made-for-tv type motion picture . the details for something lurid and exploitative are there , but that was never an approach considered by writer/director gregory nava . it's not an original tale -- movies like this abound -- but nava's point-of-view is fresh . in 1995's my family , nava explored the importance of blood ties within a mexican american family . similar themes are woven into selena . nava has brought back much of the cast of my family to star in selena . the two key on-screen contributors to this movie -- jennifer lopez as selena and edward james olmos as her father , abraham quintanilla -- had roles in the previous feature . both are superb choices for their parts here . there's nothing cliched about the way olmos approaches abraham , who , in less expert hands , could have become a hackneyed type . jennifer lopez is radiant as the title character , conveying the boundless energy and enthusiasm that exemplified selena , while effectively copying not only her look , but her mannerisms . i wonder if selena's family , upon watching this performance , felt an eerie sense of deja vu . it's apparent from the clips of the real performer shown at the movie's conclusion that lopez has done a masterful job of re- creating a personality . the supporting roles are no less capably filled . while meza's performance is a little rough around the edges , she shows the kind of spunk we expect from someone who would grow up to become such a charismatic figure . one of the most fascinating aspects of selena is how it deals with culture clashes . this is a lesson that selena takes to heart . nava's film flows beautifully , and the concert sequences effectively capture the electricity of such events . selena achieves the perfect emotional pitch for the subject , and , though this is a celebration of life , youth , and family , our awareness of the inevitable end lends a sense of poignancy to the proceedings . it's impossible to watch selena's triumphant astrodome concert without remembering that her life would be snuffed out less than a month later . roberto clemente . these are just a few names in a long , long list . this movie will serve to further elevate her name and advance her legend . 
0	there's something terribly depressing about a wonderful concept turned into mush by someone who doesn't know how to handle it . the irritations of a film like the replacements are far more mundane by comparison-you know that it will be at best a tolerable audience-friendly mediocrity , at worst a bland , pressed and processed entertainment mcnugget . but i'm a cheerleader , on the other hand , could have been a brilliant bit of satire . it could have been the kind of film that , even while preaching to the choir , highlights the magnificent absurdities of a very hot-button issue . could've been , but isn't . there's something in that idea to anger virtually anyone , only babbit doesn't pursue it . even the good gags babbit wrings from this variation -- like the photo in megan's school locker -- are underlined too obviously , and never reach into truly daring areas . the campy tone set in the first half-hour , including moriarty's drag diva performance , show that babbit isn't particularly interested in scathing humor . simple mockery suits her just fine . even that tone , however , proves to be one she can't sustain . but i'm a cheerleader might never have been riotously funny as the silly spoof it initially appears to be , but at least it might have felt consistent . babbit makes the ridiculous decision to bounce back and forth between scoring points off swishy stereotypes , exploring the conflicts of family reaction to homosexuality and developing an actual romantic sub-plot . there's not nearly enough substance to but i'm a cheerleader for its serious side to feel anything but token , and too many misguided serious moments to give it a real comic kick . and you can feel that potential being crushed under babbit's leaden heel every time megan and graham share a tender moment . there are plenty of people who take the idea of converting gays and lesbians to heterosexuality very seriously , and plenty of people with same-sex attractions who desperately want such programs to work . babbit never seems to clue into that fact , or she would base her satire more squarely in the growing popularity of these programs . instead , she lays out but i'm a cheerleader as though the whole idea were self-evidently ludicrous , and gets lazy about finding the humor in people scrambling for conformity , acceptance and easy answers to a challenging issue . but i'm a cheerleader simply isn't funny enough often enough , and that's the kiss of death for a low-budget comedy full of broad performances and careless story-telling ( what happened to the foreshadowing involving another girl's apparent jealousy of megan and graham's relationship ? ) . there's no excuse for a subject this incendiary to be the stuff of pratfalls and sappy endings . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
2	it's said that the worst thing for a parent is to watch the burial of their child . in rafal zielinski's insightful and unsettling fun , the premise is that two teenage girls meet , form an immediate friendship , and go in search of something " important " to share . although the different time frames are interleaved , there's little opportunity for confusion . not only do the different cinematographic styles separate time periods , they emphasize tone . there is no guilt or remorse . the killing -- a bloody , sadistic crime -- is shrugged off as just another way to enjoy life . it's the source of an adrenaline rush , a way to get high without drugs . it forges the kind of permanent bond in a new friendship that no mundane act can accomplish . hillary and bonnie's friendship is neither traditional nor healthy . the gradual development crucial to most relationships is bypassed . hillary and bonnie are no longer individuals -- they have acquired a single , psychotic identity . character development in fun is superior . not only does zielinski delve into the personalities of his protagonists , but he gives us random pieces of information to flesh out the less important characters . the counselor , for example , is not just a mouthpiece of judicial platitudes -- she's constantly fighting to overcome a misspent past . but , of course , everything comes back to hillary and bonnie , and the marvelous manner in which their characters are written and realized . these girls have deeply rooted problems . bonnie , with a wild , flamboyant personality that contrasts with her friend's introspective moodiness , is desperately in need of love , and will do or say anything to get it . obviously , there will be no academy awards for fun ; even if it had a u . s . distributor ( which it doesn't ) , this isn't the sort of movie to attract the necessary publicity . that said , however , alicia witt's remarkable performance is far better than that of most oscar winners . zielinski has a tremendous sense of mood and atmosphere , and he uses all the tools at his disposal to fashion the perfect tone . the camera work is impressive , and the choice of mixing color and black-and-white works to better effect here than in mrs . with themes and ideas in common with the likes of heavenly creatures , henry : portrait of a serial killer , natural born killers , and kieslowski's a short film about killing , fun is an example of a motion picture willing to tackle more than one thought-provoking concept . the intelligent , gripping result succeeds impressively , and presents a more complete and provocative portrait of relevant issues than any of those films . above all , however , fun gives us a chance to peer into the psyches of two memorable characters . 
0	ladd speaks in a laconic monotone voice , while jones is shrill and unappealing . besides the dullness of the story , it seemed far-fetched . it seemed as if the film ran out of oxygen and just wanted to end . vickey is warm to him , but the others treat him with disrespect . the drama never had much of an impact , and the story seemed silly and misplaced . it over sentimentalized the children and made the adults into wooden caricatures of evil . ladd seemed miscast , while jones failed to be convincing in her role . 
1	an above-par courtroom drama , set in los angeles , elevated by director/screenwriter clifford odets' sharp script . he originally intended for this work to be a play . it was also elevated by an outstanding cast , with special kudos to rita hayworth's warm portrayal of a woman in an abusive marriage and by sanford meisner's forceful and expressive performance as the cross-examing prosecutor . the beauty in the film is in the long-drawn-out courtroom dramatics . the story itself wasn't too interesting , but the performances were energetic and the film had a good courtroom style , enough to make this chatty film well worth seeing . 
2	a brilliant , witty mock documentary of jean seberg , that puts words in her mouth that she might have approved of , but did not actually say , these are mark rappaport's words . she was to appear in many films afterward , but her best role might have been in a film few people saw or cared about , lilith . this film challenges our credibility , it offers a fascinating look at the world of make believe and the politics of the times , telling us secrets that may or may not be true . it also enlightens us that seberg's stare into the camera was basically a no-no for an actor to do at that time , but is now acceptable , making her a trend setter . this is a clever film , immensely satisfying and enjoyable ; and , fortunately , the director casts jean in a favorable light , she seems to deserve that . 
1	screenplay : robert b . weide , based on the novel by kurt vonnegut . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 113 minutes . having read most of kurt vonnegut's novels before viewing mother night , i predicted to myself that it was the most likely of vonnegut's works to make a successful transition to the screen . much of the vonnegut canon has struck me as singularly unfilmable -- including one which _was_ filmed , slaughterhouse-five -- but mother night's narrative was a relatively straightforward one , and its themes equally direct . in a sense , director keith gordon's mother night has proved me correct ; in another sense , it has proved me dreadfully wrong . thought well-crafted and moderately compelling in its own right , mother night loses a lot with the absence of vonnegut's ironic voice . where the novel was a sly social comedy , the film strives almost for greek tragedy . it is a finely constructed narrative which holds the focus on one of vonnegut's key lines : " we are what we pretend to be , so we must be careful what we pretend to be . " there is a difference , however , between retaining lines and retaining the tone of those lines , and that is where robert b . weide's script becomes a disappointment . though mother night deals with heavy subject matter -- conscience , personal identity , the holocaust -- vonnegut never resorted to heaviness to tell the story . the kind of detached irony which is vonnegut's stock in trade is tough to convey cinematically , and gordon steers instead into the twin extremes of overly straight drama ( as in the scene where campbell watches an old newsreel of himself with growing horror ) or broad comedy ( the portrayal of a collection of hate-mongers who idolize campbell ) . too often , however , the earnestness becomes burdensome . it is an example of gordon and weide's traditional filmic story-telling that they try to turn certain twists of identity or plot developments into grand surprises , when vonnegut reveals them casually through campbell's narration long before the events occur chronologically . mother night may be one of his most traditionally plotted novels , but it still isn't about the plot . . . it's about a perspective and an idea . gordon has not made a bad film ; it is well-acted and keeps you interested from moment to moment . he simply wants campbell's moment of truth to come like a thunderbolt , rather than the way vonnegut prefers to deliver it : as a single finger tapping you ever so lightly on the shoulder . 
2	in this minimalist tale , the two are interviewed separately by an unseen jacques viala , who could never get either one of them to reveal their fantasy , and what's more , they sometimes had different impressions about the affair . interestingly , this is a very steamy story , but the sex is not explicit . . . as we also see that they are both sensitive , intelligent and respectable people . it was a great bedroom lovemaking scene , which was intimately done with both humor and passion . but the viewer , unable to know more than the little he sees about them , can only guess at what draws them so close . the story played more like a gimmick than a real love affair , because after their initial encounters , it seemed rather strange that these intelligent people wouldn't be curious to know more about each other , especially since they were developing a certain bond together . yet , on the other hand , the reason this film worked so well , was the illuminated performance by baye , who was 50 at the time of the film , but looks much younger and has such a touching quality about her , that she is simply ravishing . and if you add to that the mature script by french novelist and playwright philippe blasband and the classy way frederic fonteyne directed , it is easy to see why the film was so enthralling . what you get is an affair that turns out to be in surprisingly good taste , but without satisfying the more mundane matters in a relationship . it was as if this was a sex lab experiment , an ideal couple was being tested to see if a purely sexual encounter could spark a more intimate relationship . if the film moved off its experimental mode and let us see the couple act away from the controlled ground rule conditions , this might have been an even much better film . the film was originally titled " une liaison pornographique . " it won for best film at venice . 
1	a great labyrinth plot , ala hitchcock , as mamet delves into the greedy corporate world and its nasty secrets of espionage and bitter competition , and dangles this world in front of us , with all its perks and glitter and hopes for money being the big payoff for these corporate types . this nearly perfectly executed film , never fails to surprise and it accomplishes this by telling an old-fashioned story without one explicit sex scene or one single curse word , earning it a pg rating . the chink in the story's armor is , when you see how it ends , you realize it doesn't add up . the fun seems to be in the telling of the story and not in the story itself making sense . this is a masterfully crafted thriller for the '90s and its new values and lingo . steve martin ( that's right , pal ) steals the film with his stellar performance mixing affable charm and dark mystery to hide his persona . this something , 'the process , ' is what should put him figuratively on 'easy street . ' 'the process' is a mcguffin , a hitchcock invented term , it is something to focus your attention on without knowing what it really is . its explanation for the movie is that it has something to do with a formula that can control the global market . but what mamet really is showing , is greed and how that poisonous desire makes the world spin . this is pointed out when the board members of a company want to know how much they will earn from investing in it and joe writes the supposed astronomical figure on a blackboard , which the audience is not privileged to see but is supposed to be impressed by it through the response taken from watching the widening eyes of the board members . this pulls him very close to the audience , as they identify with him and his situation , even if it is hardly possible that they themselves would ever be in such a position . this is the kind of hero that speaks realistically to what could happen to anyone in today's work place , especially to someone who doesn't play the corporate game , and who doesn't know that the first axiom in business for the dishonest types , is always do business as if someone is trying to screw you . in this film , it has nothing to do with spain or a prisoner . this tale is more frightening than a hundred action films put together . it is eerie because the innocent hero asks , during one of his low points , " why steal what others worked for ? " it is a film that earnestly asks , `why is it that nobody in this world is what they seem ? ' has mamet really ended the film by tying up all the loose ends and leaving us with the kind of ending we as an audience wanted ? and the answer is . . . maybe . this is a film for people who like to use their noodle and are able to appreciate films that can't be tidied up so easily . even the so-called tidy ending here might not be as tidy as it first appears , if you look carefully you will spot some loose ends . 
2	it's almost the turn of the century -- no , not this century . but h ? lderlin has a problem . in a movie gorgeously filmed by egon werdin , the occasion of their first encounter is pure magic . throughout the rest of the movie , the male lead's beauty outshines the female's , but not in this scene , in which she looks like something sent from heaven . writer susanne schneider does a masterful job of naturally weaving in passages of h ? lderlin's poetry without it ever sounding stilted or forced . as directed by nina grosse , the lavish costume drama makes careful choices about what to explain and what to just let happen . the precise results are unpredictable but almost certainly undesirable -- at least for the husband . at almost two and one quarter hours , the movie sags when a little judicious pruning would have kept the focus . and after a logical conclusion right after susette's death , the movie continues on with a anticlimactic and overlong epilogue that would have been better handled in a written explanation in the closing credits . these faults are minor , however , and detract little from the success of this picture of tragic romance . it is not rated but would probably be an r for very brief sex , nudity and violence . it would be fine for teenagers . 
2	as movie-goers , we expect different things from big-budget summer=20 blockbusters than we do from " normal " films . considerations of theme=20 and character become secondary to action and mind-numbing excitement . =20 the plot is expected to be very basic -- only complex enough to frame=20 the spills and chills . jurassic park is a perfect example of this sort=20 of thing , as is last year's die hard with a vengeance . this year's=20 first entry is the eye-popping , ear-blasting twister , jan de bont's=20 violent weather follow-up to speed . it's a perfect motion picture roller coaster --=20 fun , fast , and furious=85 as long as you don't think too hard . in real life , violent weather can be both terrifying and=20 exhilarating . there's nothing quite like standing in the path of a=20 monster storm , even if it earns you the label of having a death wish ( in=20 fact , it's the possibility of death that gets the adrenaline pumping ) . there=20 are times when the tornado strikes seem a little too " glamorized " by the=20 special effects gurus , but , in general , these ilm-fashioned monsters=20 generate enough awe to make us feel that we're watching the " finger of=20 god . " in real life , tornado chasing has a higher percentage of misses=20 than sightings , so the fact that every expedition in twister unearths a=20 powerful storm comes across as a too-obvious-to-miss plot contrivance . =20 not that we really care . de bont keeps things moving , and , except for a=20 few feeble character-building scenes , our heroes are on the road=20 speeding after , or away from , spinning devastation . it's one of the=20 film's most effective sequences , as a family of three flees into a=20 shelter to escape an oncoming storm . apparently , nature doesn't make a good enough villain , so the=20 writers of twister decided to add some nasty human rivals . =20 unfortunately , cary elwes' character is both unnecessary and irritating ; =20 the tornadoes are enough . it's a rather=20 boring subplot , and , if these two had been together from the beginning=20 ( they are married , albeit almost divorced ) , we would have been spared=20 the presence of jami gertz' unappealing character . without de bont's energetic direction , the seams in=20 crichton's script ( which was co-written with his wife , anne-marie=20 martin ) would have been more apparent . fortunately , the film's fast=20 pace and stunning audio/visual elements camouflage the deficiencies . =20 and it helps that both helen hunt and bill paxton , while not " major " =20 stars , are likable and share a pleasant camaraderie . they're our guides=20 through tornado territory , and we need their stability with de bont=20 throwing everything at us -- including the kitchen . twister is peppered with bits of information about how to react if=20 a tornado approaches , how dangerous the storms can be , etc . despite=20 these snippets of safety-conscious advice , the movie doesn't function as=20 a public service announcement , nor should it . twister doesn't have any=20 pretensions . it is what it sets out to be : an effective piece of big=20 money , early summer entertainment designed to blow viewers away . 
1	director : tom shadyac . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 115 minutes . we've seen this robin williams before , though not much recently . this is robin williams the crowd-pleasing riff-meister , playing the comedy-drama character arc in which he is temporarily sobered by tragedy but eventually emerges triumphant in the lives he has touched with humor . this is the robin williams -- the stand-up comic with the heart of gold -- that we see in patch adams , the fact-based story of a medical student whose unconventional approach to patient care endears him to patients while irritating the establishment . unfortunately , we've never seen this character so compromised by such an aggressively feel-good film . the first half of patch adams certainly belongs to williams the clown , given free rein to do his stuff ; not coincidentally , it's also the most entertaining half . his rebel with the mile-a-minute mind delivers quite a few laughs through an hour of patch adams , but then again , he has to . it's so obvious where this narrative is headed from the moment he enters medical school , williams offers the only spark of invention . even when contending with the hammering pathos of grinning , hairless children , he still has the ability to disarm an audience with a joke . those grinning , hairless children do bode ill for the second half , when patch adams gets serious on us . it's not just that screenwriter steve oedekerk and director tom shadyac ( who teamed up on eddie murphy's the nutty professor ) play to the most cliched devices of emotional manipulation , like a tearful speech over a grave and a pedantic speech in a courtroom setting . what's worse is that they don't understand when _not_ to resort to emotional manipulation . instead of allowing the scene any sort of sensitivity or dignity , they turn it into a romantic interlude , complete with marc shaiman's obtrusive , syrupy underscore ( shaiman's work should be declared a health risk for diabetics ) . patch adams not only dares you not to be uplifted , it jams a forklift under your seat and slowly grinds you into the ceiling of the theater . i know plenty of viewers will be amused enough by williams' antics to consider patch adams worthwhile . i know plenty of viewers will be applauding patch sticking it to big medicine as the end credits roll . patch adams is a calculated , carefully constructed response machine , unencumbered by complexities like making the traditional doctors anything more than ogres . true story or no , this is a vehicle for robin williams as we've known him best and loved him most . he's the non-conformist ready to quip you into submission . . . except that he appears all-too-willing to conform to formulaic roles in formulaic films . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
2	did i mention that she has never really met david , except , that is , on television ? you see , david isn't real either . he is just the lead character in the popular soap opera , " a reason to love . " delightful playing bad soap star george mccord , kinnear is equally charming as george's television character , david . here we want betty and david , i mean george , to get together since both are so appealing . after all , david said on the television that " i just know that there's something really special out there for me , " and she knows that he must have been speaking about her . with a huge smile , betty has a childlike innocence . as george says to her , " your dedication scares me . " the surprising scene when they first meet is the most brightly written one in a script bursting with wonderfully imaginative scenes . the screenplay by john c . richards and james flamberg won the award as the best screenplay at this year's cannes international film festival . director labute , known for his demonic dramas ( in the company of men ) and caustic comedies ( your friends & neighbors ) , is one of my personal favorites . this , his third film , is the first time that he has worked from someone else's script . here , he proves , in case there was any doubt , that he's just as brilliant a director as he is a writer . and this being a labute film , there is an undercurrent of danger , as well as a bit of pathos . nevertheless , the film is an amazingly good-spirited one , especially for someone known for exploring people's darkest impulses . the cheerful cinematography by jean-yves escoffier ( good will hunting ) with its bright colors adds to the story's upbeat ambiance . the strong supporting cast has so many terrific performances that it is hard to pick a favorite , but mine might be allison janney ( american beauty ) as the soap's hard-nosed producer . i won't give away how nurse betty ends , but i thought it was perfect , especially its little epilog , which was icing on the cake . it is rated r for strong violence , pervasive language and a scene of sexuality and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
2	homegrown is a lovable off-the-wall film that , probably , very few people have seen or even heard about . that might be because the film goes off on so many different directions-- from murder to counter-culture romance-- before it zeroes into the hippy drug dealing scene as it evolved from the '60s to what it is today , which makes it a too controversial topic for sony to know how to advertise and release to theaters . this is a film that you will probably only get a chance to see on cable or video . its highly animated story is both funny and suspenseful , with a good deal of its plot made up of the kind of material reserved for a sociologist who is writing a treatise on why certain types of people must be outlaws ; the director's aim was to make a take-off on the treasure of the sierra madre theme , but this time with a stoned-out foursome lured by the possibility of making 3 million dollars through growing and dealing marijuana . a lot of the big-name stars in the film must have seen the merits of this enterprise , because their cameo appearances and the small amount of money they received for being in the film indicates that this was strictly a labor of love for them . it therefore left a very cloudy message about what is a serious matter concerning the whole drug culture . it was a much clearer film to evaluate , if viewed as an enjoyable dark comedy . but don't be mislead by what i just said . this is a well-written and acted and directed film , that is often disarmingly brilliant , getting right in the face of an outlaw lifestyle that is both dangerous and beautiful . it does this better than any other film i have seen in recent times that attempted to tackle this sort of material . the implied message is : the government's drug policy is just not working . 
1	clay birdwell is certainly unlucky in love . and those are only a few of the dead bodies that show up in director david dobkin's little film noir called clay pigeons . bringing little to the role , joaquin's deadpan acting style is used by the director as the background canvas upon which to sketch the story . the happy-go-lucky lester oozes so much charm that women almost drool over him . " i'm like a big fireworks show , " he declares with his usual big smile and slightly nervous , hearty laughter . " i'm very bright . " luckily for him and the audience , janeane garofalo shows up about midway through the picture and immediately enlivens it . although there is not a lot to recommend the film , there isn't anything much to criticize either . it is an enjoyable enough little movie , and garofalo is always fun to watch . it is rated r for violence , sex , nudity and profanity and would be fine for older teenagers . 
1	screenplay : andrew fleming and sheryl longin . director : andrew fleming . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , drug use , adult themes , adult humor ) running time : 94 minutes . this may be a first in my six years as a film critic : i'm going to give the bulk of the credit for a film's success to the casting director . the film is dick , a political/historical satire with a sporadically amusing script and competent enough direction -- in short , the stuff of fairly average entertainment . if dick pushes over the edge of average-ness , it's because the cast dives into the material with such gusto that the film finds sparks of inspired comedy . casting director pam dixon mickelson has stocked dick with such a wealth of talent that it's fun just watching them stroll into the shot . the premise is silly high-concept stuff , centered around two high school best friends in washington d . c . circa 1972 -- simple-minded arlene lorenzo ( michelle williams ) and even more simple-minded betsy jobs ( kirsten dunst ) . the gag is pretty thin to begin with , and it's not even particularly original . it's all good for a few knowing chuckles , but once you tune into the pattern , you can see virtually every joke coming from several minutes away . what you can't necessarily see coming is the appeal of the performances . the key players in the administration are all played with zest by a wonderful comic cast -- hedaya as a tragically unhip nixon , harry shearer as a paranoid g . gordon liddy , breuer as the guilt-stricken john dean , saul rubinek as an insecure henry kissinger . more entertaining still are ferrell and mcculloch as woodward and bernstein , playing the two reporters as feuding glory hounds with a relationship somewhere between sibling rivals and closeted lovers . and in the middle of this who's who of sketch comedy alumni , michelle williams and kirsten dunst have tremendous fun with their ditzy characters . dunst may be the more accomplished actress of the two , but it's williams who gets the juicier part of a teen who develops a secret crush on nixon . there's nothing quite as incongruously funny as arlene's fantasy of a scowling dick riding across a beach on a white stallion . it would have been nice if andrew fleming and sheryl longin's script had found more scenes to match that one for sheer goofiness value . too often it gets a bit lazy , opting for yet another historical coulda-been or one of many comic uses of the name " dick . " dick hits a few dead spots , but whenever it starts to lag it gets a jolt from the energetic cast . remember the name pam dixon mickelson if you happen to be casting a comedy any time soon . it's nice to have someone who can gather an all-star team for the comedic equivalent of slow-pitch softball . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	all other issues momentarily aside , there is a huge question that needs to be answered : how can gallimard have lived with , and made love to , this person for eighteen years , yet not recognized that liling is actually a man ? no firm solution is given , and the subject is only tackled in the most oblique and unsatisfactory manner . while the romance between gallimard and liling isn't particularly effective ( jeremy irons generates about as much heat as an ice cube ) , there are at least some interesting ideas presented here which , if nothing else , provide fodder for the intellect . as a whole , the plot doesn't pay much attention to reality , despite having been based on a true-to-life scandal . there are a lot of little things that simply don't ring true . yet , despite all the problems , m . butterfly remains strangely compelling through most of the first hour , and a great deal of the credit for this must go to actor john lone , who does an excellent job in a challenging role . however , when the scene shifts to paris , the story gets so disjointed and confused that it's impossible to know what to think . the emotions released are obviously not heartfelt , and the lack of any genuine catharsis leaves the audience detached and frustrated . the final scene is artsy , symbolic , pretentious , and empty . rarely have i been more disgusted by a supposedly-intelligent film's choice of " resolutions " . i had thought cronenberg a better craftperson than this . needless to say , there are similarities between m . butterfly and the crying game , but beyond the switched-gender portrayals , there isn't much substance to the comparisons . the bulk of the crying game makes sense ; the same cannot be said about this movie . there are also a few issues touched on here that are presented far more effectively in farewell my concubine . jeremy irons has done some excellent work in the past , but he is badly miscast here ( as he was in louis malle's damage ) . the role of gallimard demands an actor who can effectively convey deeply-felt passions and a driving obsession , tasks that irons appears incapable of . he is flat , so the movie , which is told almost exclusively from his perspective , sputters and fizzles helplessly . m . butterfly disappoints in almost every area , which is a shame considering the high regard with which the play has been received . the movie , however , seems to make the wrong decision at almost every opportunity , trying for the kind of melodramatic tragedy that only works in opera . motion pictures like this need a firm grounding in reality which , sadly , cronenberg has failed to provide . 
1	those leaving federal hill with a strong sense of deja vu can be forgiven for that impression . with a moody score and crisp black-and-white cinematography , the opening scene of federal hill , which features the burglary of an upscale providence residence , promises a lot more than the rest of the film is able to deliver . from this point on , the movie quickly degenerates into an amalgamation of situations and characters pilfered from such efforts as amongst friends , a bronx tale , and others . the interaction of these characters , which is intended to form the backbone of federal hill , is more than passingly reminiscent of what went on in rob weiss' amongst friends , a far better chronicle of fractured friendships and criminal appeal . moments of originality are scarce here . apparently , writer/director michael corrente found it less demanding to plunder previous genre entries than strike out in a new direction . character development is sketchy at best , with no real growth apparent in anyone . this is certainly due in large part to a script that is more concerned with a story than with those the story is about , but the weak ( and largely inexperienced ) cast cannot be completely absolved . with the exceptions of nicholas turturro , whose performance as ralph is suitably manic , and the vastly-underused frank vincent , none of the actors excel . especially disappointing are anthony de sando and libby langdon , who are frequently unconvincing in central roles . the supposed chemistry between them never gives off more than fitful sparks . it has been repeatedly proven that , when a connection is made with the audience , unpleasant characters often make the most fascinating protagonists ( for a recent example , take a look at quentin tarantino's pulp fiction ) . in federal hill , however , corrente's attempts to forge that link are largely unsuccessful , resulting in a bunch of small-time hoods that it's difficult to care about one way or another . it's somewhat mystifying why this film has received acclaim at several international film festivals . perhaps there is a fascination with certain , admittedly-colorful elements of the italian-american community ( this is no godfather or goodfellas , but vestiges of those pictures' " flavor " has been retained ) . regardless , despite a solidly- constructed story line , federal hill is one of the least innovative or interesting american independent films to come along this year . 
2	for every happy , " traditional " family , there's one that fits under the broad envelope of " dysfunctional . " in general , motion pictures are made about those in the latter category rather than the former , because the dramatic potential is better . marvin's room , based on the play of the same name , is one of those movies that delves beneath the thinly- applied varnish covering the gaping holes in a series of sundered family relationships . like andre techine's ma saison preferee , what begins as an apparently simple tale of sibling interaction reveals a complex web of pain , guilt , and uncertainty . mcpherson went on to write the film's screenplay before succumbing to aids-related complications . and , while the narrative is not intended to be biographical , mcpherson nevertheless drew heavily on his own experiences while writing it . director jerry zaks widens the canvas here , expanding the film's locales to a florida beach and disneyworld while continuing to maintain the level of emotional intensity that makes this a memorable story . but all is not well between these characters . in many ways , however , this film is not a downer , because it encourages us to look at the good things in a day-to- day existence . nothing is really resolved by the time we reach the somewhat abrupt ending , but the seeds of hope have been planted . in her own words , " i've had such love in my life . i look back , and i've had such love . " most of marvin's room is dialogue , as one might expect from a play- to-film script . there are a few missteps . for example , aunt ruth is devised primarily as a source of comic relief , but there are times when the humor feels forced and artificial . there are also a few occasions when character interaction falls into over-familiar patterns . some of the early scenes between lee and bessie unfold in a too-predictable fashion . yet , even on those occasions when the screenplay falters , the actors are there to take up the slack . it's impossible to decide who does the best job here . each has their own particular series of moments , and , by the time the final credits roll , lee , bessie , and hank have been developed into fully-rounded characters . what's more , the often-subtle changes to each of their personalities have been effectively realized by the actors . robert deniro , cast against type , is seen in a rare supporting performance as a well-meaning doctor . hume cronyn spends most of his time unconscious or mumbling as the title character , but he does have a pair of magical scenes , one of which occurs at the end . hal scardino is fine as charlie , and gwen verdon enables us to feel for a character whose primary purpose is to make us laugh when there are so many reasons to cry . it takes a lot of thought and reflection to untangle all the complex relationships revealed throughout marvin's room . sure , there's a tragedy here , but , ultimately , i think the tone of marvin's room is far more positive than the subject matter might lead anyone to believe . 
1	cast : jim carrey , maura tierney , justin cooper , jennifer tilley , cary elwes , amanda donohoe , swoosie kurtz director : tom shadyac producers : brian grazer screenplay : paul guay & stephen mazur cinematography : russell boyd music : john debney and james newton howard u . s . distributor : universal pictures while watching liar liar , it occurred to me that the chief problem with this film is that it has a script . if jim carrey had been unleashed without such silly , incidental constraints as plot and dialogue , who knows where things might have gone ? as it is , however , carrey is forced to confine his antics to the needs of liar liar's unimaginative screenplay , and the results are mixed . there are times when carrey is excruciatingly funny , but , on those occasions when he's expected to do anything remotely approaching " real " acting , his limitations become abundantly clear . liar liar is the latest in a long line of movies to skewer lawyers . in this case , the assumption is that it's impossible for an attorney to get through the day without resorting to all sorts of lies and half- truths . for a nation that has just endured more than a year's worth of o . j . simpson-related testimony , this idea has a great deal of resonance . so , although a smartly-written satire about this subject could be immensely satisfying , that film is * not * liar liar . as directed by physical comedy specialist tom shadyac ( ace ventura : pet detective , the nutty professor ) , this outing is designed for one purpose only -- as a showcase for jim carrey . the potential richness of the premise is irrelevant . carrey plays ( and i use that word loosely ) fletcher reede , a slick- talking lawyer whose over-the-top court performances have earned him numerous unexpected victories . several of the court scenes are equally funny , with carrey investing so much zany energy that it's almost impossible not to laugh . there's no denying that the actor is a gifted physical comic , and his fans will almost certainly be pleased by what he has accomplished here . unfortunately , there is a dramatic element to this story , and that's where carrey stumbles . that aspect of the film doesn't really work , however , because carrey's lack of range has us snickering almost as much at his attempts to be serious as at his most outrageous comic moments . all-in-all , liar liar is pretty good fun , and it represents one of carrey's most entertaining movies to date . ( could he -- gasp -- be growing on me ? ) the comic is in top form , both in the material that made it into the picture and during the end-credit outtakes ( which , in many ways , are funnier ) . and it's delightful to watch performers like amanda donohoe and helium-voiced jennifer tilley struggle to keep their composure when carrey does something exceptionally goofy . in the past , i have said that i generally prefer jim carrey in small doses . this may be the exception . without him , liar liar would have been an unforgivably bad movie . with him , it's a mediocre film peppered with amusing highlights . and , honestly , i think that just about says all that needs to be said about gentleman jim's followup to the cable guy . 
1	screenplay : duncan kennedy and donna powers & wayne powers . director : renny harlin . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 105 minutes . steven spielberg has said for years that one of the keys to the success of jaws was technical failure . the mechanical shark affectionately nicknamed " bruce " wasn't necessarily supposed to be a shadowy figure menacing the protagonists from the fringes of the frame -- he just didn't work right . bruce's frequent unannounced work stoppages forced spielberg to get more creative . the rest is a milestone in cinematic suspense history , further proof that real terror comes not from what we see , but from what we're afraid we're going to see . it would be easy enough to scoff at deep blue sea as a gloss on jaws that just doesn't " get it , " but that wouldn't be entirely fair . jaws , whether intentionally or made necessary by technical limitations , was a suspense film ; deep blue sea is an old-fashioned monster movie . the genre conventions are all terribly conventional , but director renny harlin stages them with methodical effectiveness . there are a few solid scares and one magnificently effective shock , the kind that leaves an audience giggling nervously for several seconds . there's even some cautionary nonsense about scientific hubris , in the fine tradition of frankenstein or the fly . it's what monster movies are supposed to do , and deep blue sea uses its trio of toothy villains to deliver the requisite armrest-gripping . if only anyone involved with the script had taken a second to go beyond the merely requisite . deep blue sea is full of half-completed characters doing generally stupid things . granted , the monster movie as we know it would not exist without people doing generally stupid things , but it's still frustrating to put up with them saying stupid things at the same time . the film gets even sloppier by positing not merely that the sharks have developed advanced intelligence , but that they have apparently studied physics and engineering , and had access to detailed schematic diagrams of the facility . there's only so far a film can involve you when it treats the viewers as though they're dumb and treats the characters as though they're chum . deep blue sea is , of course , following in some mighty big footsteps in the killer shark milieu , which makes it even more surprising that there are so many echoes of jaws and its sequels . it's almost as though harlin and company _want_ the film to be compared to jaws , as though they think they've one-upped the ultimate shark film . in the press notes , harlin says of jaws , " it's 25 years later , and audiences , accustomed to animatronics and computer-generated imagery , need to see more . " and perhaps he's right , but that still only makes deep blue sea a technically-proficient monster movie . as character-driven suspense , it bites off much more than it can chew . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	pretty boy josh hartnett , last seen unimpressively in pearl harbor , delivers an even more underwhelming performance in tim blake nelson's o . first-time screenwriter brad kaaya's script for o is very loosely based on shakespeare's othello . mekhi phifer ( i still know what you did last summer ) plays the team's star , odin james , and hartnett is the team's very jealous , utility player , hugo goulding . nelson has all of his actors speaking in whispers . this risky technique can work , as it did spectacularly in the deep end , but with actors more interested in posing than working , the effect is sleep inducing . sheen , to his credit , does chew up the scenery in a hopeless attempt to wake up the sleepy production . the very preppy , southern school -- both sexes are required to wear blazers and ties -- has only one black , odin , a kid of fairly average height who appears nba bound . having one lone black allows the screenwriter to throw in a bunch of clich ? d racial lines . although it contains one of the most unconvincingly staged murders in recent memory , the last act does breathe some needed life into an otherwise s-l-o-w movie . it is rated r for violence , a scene of strong sexuality , language and drug use and would be acceptable for most teenagers . in the silicon valley , it will be playing at the amc and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
2	anyone who expects historical accuracy from a disney animated feature should be ashamed of themselves . writers binder , grant , and lazebnik have changed those details ( and more ) in an effort to create a story that appeals to both children and adults . taking advantage of the studio's breathtakingly intricate animation , directors mike gabriel and eric goldberg have breathed vitality into this , the fifth " new wave " disney animated feature . this film isn't quite as cute ; deals with some reasonably serious , " adult " issues ; and contains an element of poignancy . considering the less upbeat nature of the story , pocahontas isn't as fun or energetic as its disney predecessors . the plot moves somewhat slowly , disdaining the frantic pace of the lion king . the menken/schwartz musical production numbers are lively ( and probably better than anything since beauty and the beast ) , but their on-screen time represents less than a third of the movie's " action . " while none is presented with any special subtlety ( after all , children are supposed to get the message ) , there is surprisingly little preaching . it would have been easy to turn this into a " native american good/white man bad " film , but positive and negative traits are shown on both sides . the governor will not go down in history as one of the great disney villains . he's more of a loud-mouthed boor than anything else -- not an evil-to-the-bone nasty like jaffar or ursula . children everywhere will flock to see it , accompanied by adults who rightfully recognize disney animated films as solid entertainment for the over-ten crowd . the only question about this movie is whether , without the " happily-ever-after " ending , it will attract the repeat business of aladdin and the lion king . 
2	starring : guinevere turner , v . s . brodie , t . wendy mcmillan , anastasia sharp , migdalia melendez director : rose troche producers : rose troche and guinevere turner screenplay : rose troche and guinevere turner cinematography : ann t . rossetti music : brendan dolan and jennifer sharpe released by the samuel goldwyn co . in many ways , the story behind the making of go fish , rose troche and guinevere turner's girl-meets-girl lesbian love story , is as interesting as the actual film . this is certainly not a case of a low-budget independent movie flowing smoothly until the rights are bought by a distributor . in formulating this movie , the two women had two primary goals in mind : present a good , entertaining movie about lesbians , and have some fun doing it . said troche , " it's important for a first feature : make it simple , do something you know . and a lot of it came so purely from what we wanted to see--a film that , as two lesbians , we would be really excited to see . " while max is a cute , lively , and energetic young woman , ely is reserved , self-conscious , and not especially attractive . the characters that surround max and ely are almost as interesting as the two principals . there's kia ( t . the basic subject material is , of course , nothing new . but the unique and humorous spin that troche and turner place on it , is . go fish is a thoroughly engaging motion picture with a touching romance and a great deal of humorous commentary . that commentary is provided by go fish's version of a greek chorus : kia , evy , daria , and daria's lover-of-the-moment . in a more polished movie , this technique might seem inappropriate , but in the context of the grainy , black-and-white go fish , it works just fine . the film certainly isn't a technical masterpiece . the quality of the 35 mm blowup print varies from adequate to poor , the sound occasionally isn't synchronized with the picture , and the " arty " edits employed by rose troche confuse as often as they provide an effective transition . some of the acting is wooden ( as might be expected from amateurs ) and more than a few lines of dialogue come across as stilted . when was the last time you heard someone use " facilitate " in a sentence , as in " why don't you facilitate a relationship for me ? " nevertheless , troche and turner have achieved their aim--go fish is the most enjoyable and entertaining gay/lesbian film to come along in a few years . it is heartfelt , able and willing to see the humor in almost any situation , and avoids a preachy or condescending tone . this is a modern romance of the sort that hollywood is afraid to touch . fortunately , there are filmmakers like troche and turner who are determined to make and distribute a go fish , no matter what obstacles stand in their way . 
0	a wonderfully hokey b-movie , that is a derivative thriller from the director with all the gimmicks , william castle ( tingler ) . here he uses a fright-clock on screen , giving those audience members who are too frightened to see the scary conclusion , a chance to leave the theater . we don't have showmen like castle around anymore , instead we got corporate executive types running the studios , looking only at the bottom line . they have taken the fun out of promoting a movie and have made it just another stale business marketing venture . castle also effectively features in homicidal a lot of copycat things from other films , such as the psychotic mannerisms of the killer , which was lifted straight out of psycho . that the story makes absolutely no sense and has more holes in it than swiss cheese , is besides the point . it's obvious that he will grow up to be a sick one . the pyscho-dynamics of this twisted yarn , as they unfold , are a real hoot to watch . emily and warren ( jean arless ) speak in unnatural stilted tones , while karl and miriam go out together and are so sugary sweet that one could hyperventilate by just watching them . homicidal is a classical horror film , but featuring mediocre acting and plot ; its one gigantic plus is the interesting characterization by jean arless , who seems to be swimming in a different stream than the rest of the cast . the ending is predictable but fun to watch , and for that matter , this shamelessly exploitative film is a total gas . castle himself introduces the film , and thereby gets you in the right mood to see this shocker . if you are in the proper humor for a movie that doesn't take itself that seriously , you have nothing to lose by seeing it , which is the attitude the bellboy had when he mumbled just those sentiments to himself before accepting the bizarre marriage proposal offered him by the seemingly attractive blonde . this is the kind of film that defies critical analysis , if you're in the mood for schlock-shock , this could be a most entertaining film . 
2	no matter how you feel about cute , fuzzy puppets , it's difficult to actively dislike the muppets . from their 1976 television show until today , jim henson's creations have always appealed on more than one level , offering adorable playmates and positive messages to children and surprisingly sophisticated humor to adults . muppet treasure island , the fifth big screen feature to star kermit the frog and friends , and the second directed by brian henson , delivers exactly what fans -- young and old -- expect . as was true of their 1992 outing , the muppet christmas carol , the muppets are visiting familiar motion picture territory -- there have been over a half-dozen movie adaptations of robert louis stevenson's treasure island . as usual , a few human actors get in on the fun , including tim curry and kevin bishop . muppet treasure island doesn't exactly re-invent the classic story , but it takes a few liberties with it . there have been many great on-screen/off-screen couples -- bogart and becall , tracy and hepburn , branagh and thompson -- but none are quite as intriguing as kermit and piggy . and , although they don't have many scenes together in muppet treasure island ( piggy doesn't show up until the film is two-thirds over ) , it's clear that the chemistry is still there . curry , who no one would ever call subtle , creates one of the most memorable human characters in any muppet film . as has always been true in muppet movies , set design is superb . muppet treasure island is an impressive-looking motion picture , rich in color and contrast , and featuring some impeccable matte paintings . there are the usual musical numbers -- seven jaunty tunes that will be forgotten the moment you leave the theater . they may not be memorable , but at least they're not irritating . muppet treasure island comes out under the disney umbrella , and , like every movie that is favored with mickey's midas touch , this one has the potential to be a huge favorite . the muppets certainly have " family appeal " , and the film is designed to keep parents interested and children enthralled . it's not as eye-popping as toy story or as magical as an animated feature , but muppet treasure island represents ninety- plus minutes of solid entertainment , and you won't have to dig to find it . 
2	u . s . availability : general release 4/7/95 running length : mpaa classification : pg-13 ( mature themes , nudity , profanity ) with the exception of a few small parts--some good ( a dry white season , the freshman ) and some terrible ( christopher columbus : the discovery ) -- the man once hailed as the greatest american actor has eschewed leading roles . don juan demarco is a lighthearted , frothy fable about romance and the way a patient's fantasies affect his doctor's reality . despite several astute lines which give the film an intellectual appeal , this is not an exceptionally deep movie . the playful , often humorous tone , coupled with don juan's accent , suggests the princess bride . writer/director jeremy leven takes pleasure in clouding the division between what's real and what isn't , but he never stretches matters to such an extreme that don juan demarco is reduced to a mindless farce . johnny depp is appealing as the latin lover , but the truly meaty role belongs to brando . there's nothing overtly original in the character , but brando shows he can still give a strong performance . this is far from his best work , but he's more than a match for the part , and brings to jack a human quality that encourages compassion and empathy . there is proof here-- as if any is really needed--that couples don't have to be under thirty to capture an audience's heart . with so much blurring between reality and fantasy , there are bound to be a few missteps , but leven keeps these to a minimum , and the film is mostly a success in its approach to its themes . " of what is the spirit made ? " , the proposed answer to all is " love " , that singular emotion which pervades this disarming motion picture . 
1	she has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn't seem like it's much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in . but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here . in this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken . it is written by the director's brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie . the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls . this scene didn't make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also . but i doubt that . the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets . the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film . the film's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia . she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn't have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey . the film's strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings . bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity . julia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn't know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them . this is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being . and , after all is said and done , who's to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was ! 
1	despite their radically different compositions , both groups have a lot in common . just like abba twenty years ago , the spice girls are pop wonders who manage to rise consistently to the top of the music charts despite the essential vapidity of their hits . now , for better or worse , the spice girls have done something that abba never did : starred in a movie . it's worth noting at the outset that i am definitely not a member of the target audience for this movie . i'm also not a spice girls fan . actually , going into the film , i was rather neutral towards them . they may be pleasant to look at , but their irritating antics as presented here are enough to put someone off of them permanently . suffice it to say that i won't be buying the soundtrack . the movie's premise is as flimsy as can be , but it least it doesn't require a whole lot of acting from the main quintet of baby spice ( emma bunton ) , ginger spice ( geri halliwell ) , scary spice ( melanie brown ) , sporty spice ( melanie chisholm ) , and posh spice ( victoria adams ) . in the end , however , they triumph over all adversity and wow their fans . the press package for spice world makes the jaw-dropping statement that the film is " a '90s version of a hard day's night with a pinch of this is spinal tap and a dash of speed " . time for a reality check . any similarities between spice world and those three films are entirely superficial . the speed citation points to a brief parody of a high- speed bus chase , and nothing more . no aspect of spice world's occasional pseudo-documentary approach comes close to the acid edge achieved by spinal tap . and , although the film is clearly trying to follow in the footsteps of the beatles' classic , it's several long strides behind , lacking the same sense of originality , spontaneity , high energy , and joi de vie . not to mention the differences in music quality . a hard day's night was a breath of fresh air ; spice world is recycled . sadly , however , spiers doesn't generate enough laughter here , and even the " name the next familiar face " game can't save the film . although the spice girls , who appear comfortable in front of the camera , are the headliners , there are a few legitimate performers in the film . richard e . grant leads the pack as an intentionally over-the-top neurotic who quickly got on my nerves . alan cumming , barry humphries , george wendt ( as an american movie producer ) , richard o'brien ( best known as riff raff from the rocky horror picture show ) , and claire rushbrook ( as the girls' assistant ) all have more than a few seconds of screen time . spice world is a vanity project -- an ego trip designed to show the five girls in the best possible light and give them a chance to perform about 14 numbers on-screen . as a comedy , it's weak , because most of the jokes are obvious and not especially funny . as a satire , it's weaker , because the screenplay never takes any chances and all of the mini parodies are safe , silly , and creatively lifeless . the film isn't even a particularly good musical , because the songs are so inane . the only people who are likely to be able to sit through spice world without casting numerous yearning glances at the exit are those who number themselves among the group's legion of die-hard fans . ultimately , this film has too much spice and not enough flavoring . - ingmar bergman 
2	cast : kevin costner , dennis hopper , jeanne tripplehorn , tina majorino , michael jeter director : kevin reynolds producers : charles gordon , john davis , and kevin costner screenplay : peter rader and david twohy cinematography : dean semler music : james newton howard u . s . distributor : universal pictures the makers of waterworld , the current holder of the " most expensive film " title , have put a good portion of the money where the viewing public can see it -- on the screen . this production , with its massive explosions , amazing stunts , and breathtaking visuals , is one of hollywood's most lavish features to date . it's no easy feat for human actors to emulate fish . it's an unspecified date in the future . as we're told in a quick voiceover intro , the polar ice caps have melted and earth's continents are buried under water . there is no land , and pure water and dirt have become exceptionally valuable commodities . the world is a cruel place , where brotherhood is a thing of the past , and anything -- or anyone -- can be sold or traded for as little as a sheet of paper . possessions , not people , are what matter . the other is the more tangible search for dryland , which we instinctively know is going to appear during the film's last act . after all , how often do movie quests go unfulfilled ? the script doesn't do a great job with either the spiritual or the physical trek , but the spectacular action sequences occur with enough regularity that strong writing isn't necessary to keep waterworld afloat . a little adrenaline can obscure quite a few holes . kevin costner , admittedly not the world's greatest actor , is fine as the dour mariner . with a greater range than schwarzenegger , stallone , van damme , and seagal combined , costner is more than capable of handling the limited role of an action hero . not content with merely going over-the-top this time around , hopper makes it obvious that nothing about deacon is to be taken seriously -- and the approach works . there's a strand of unmistakable , completely intentional humor running through waterworld . a couple of the more " tender " relationships fail . the mariner's affection for enola comes across as forced , despite majorino's winning performance . aliens showed what a pseudo-parent/child bond can do for a movie , and that intensity is missing here . also , the romance between the mariner and helen is perfunctory at best , and largely underdeveloped and unsatisfying . although the storyline isn't all that invigorating , the action is , and that's what saves waterworld . in the tradition of the old westerns and mel gibson's road warrior flicks , this film provides good escapist fun . everyone behind the scenes did their part with aplomb , and the result is a feast for the eyes and ears . and , though this film may have cost universal upwards of $175 million , the price at the box office for the average movie-goer will still be in the $7 . 50 range -- worth it if adventure is your kind of thing . 
0	it's a film that has the promise of being a horror story but that never quite comes together , as the film plays more like a schmaltzy nostalgia piece and bland character study about an all-american child of the 1950s , bobby garfield , who is in a bland coming-of-age film . there's not much of a story here that isn't a contrivance , or dripping with goo , or heading nowhere . and he doesn't appear to be a great seer , or someone who is very sensitive because he was hurt . as the friendship grows between the boy and the stranger , we are forced to hear such banal profundities from the pen of king uttered through the lips of hopkins as : " sometimes when you're young , you have moments of such happiness , you think you're living in someplace magical , like atlantis must have been . " everything about this film felt loaded down with good versus evil characters , with situations that seemed manufactured and did not have any flow to them . in fact you can guess how everything will turn out because there's no real story in this failed mystery story . the film's all about a contrived atmospheric mood it sets in mystery to lead you to believe something is going on , as it hopes your imagination will be better than the author's in finishing the story . in the end hopkins' portrayal is too creepy and ambivalent to draw any conclusion about what all his inward hurt means and why he seems so strange and saddened . we never see any of the lead characters develop or really get to know them , we are only led to what they might be or what they represent . everyone seemed like a cardboard character waiting for either the " low men " to emerge or for another trite golden nugget of wisdom to fall from the lips of hopkins . this film isn't even good enough to be considered a middle-brow art-house film , as it's a commercial film that tries to be a little off-kilter with little to offer in the way of suspense . 
1	it is hard for me to believe that one of the world's greatest directors and one of my favorites , paul cox ( lonely hearts/my first wife/man of flowers/cactus/a woman's tale ) , made a film that was so saintly that it seemed to be without dramatic affect or chinks in its pious armor . this is not a commercial film , nor one that tends to compromise its serious tone in order to become more entertaining . it is a true story that tries not to flinch from the suffering it presents and from the altruistic virtues of the dedicated priest who is only interested in comforting those shunned by society because of leprosy . it eschews the tricks of filmmaking in its presentation of such a morbid subject , to its detriment . there is no bend in this film . in this beautifully shot film on the island of kalaupapahe , catching the lushness of the hawaiian islands , cox has taken the subject matter of suffering to a new degree of intensity and requires the viewer to be either fully absorbed in it or else it would be impossible to feel anything about such a miserable topic as 19th century leprosy ( hansen's disease ) . there is medicine for treating leprosy as of 1940 , but the undeveloped countries still can't afford that medicine , so the disease is still around . and as brilliant a study as this is , taking on such a difficult subject , this brilliance fails to amount to anything more than being a history lesson about hawaii and about those banished to die alone from that disease on an abandoned hawaiian island called molokai . he is so touched by this , that the first leper he sees , who is a child , he not only touches but embraces . unfortunately , the storytelling remains flat despite the superb character performance by the australian david wenham . in one scene , the most dramatic one in the film , lepers are tossed off the boat docked on the island's harbor and many of them drown . it is a scene of immense cruelty , but seems to have happened as if it were a dream and not real , as not much is made of it and the film just continues on without giving pause to that event . the film just couldn't say more about the priest except that he made conditions better , converted many to catholicism , and contacted the disease and died , relieved to know that the nuns have come at last and that there is another priest to carry on the work . these are fine accomplishments , but i'm afraid , they are not dramatic enough to energize this film . i felt anguished about all the piety i was seeing , but the film despite all its obvious flaws lingered with me for a long time afterwards and i'm not quite sure why . that is why i liked it better when the film had a chance to sink in , than i did when first watching it . it's a tough film to enjoy and i'm not sure i learned anything about suffering from it , that is if i was supposed to , but i do think i saw someone who i believe is an actual saint , and he was a spellbinding saintly figure despite being so unapproachable . it was the very best thing i have to say about a tedious film that i am glad i saw , even if i was not entertained by it . 
0	he assumes this will happen once he displays the bomb at the science fair and he also thinks , what could they do to me if i'm caught , i'm just a kid ! at the fair , the film breaksdown into a madcap thriller . unfortunately , only a few of marshall brickman's funny pearls get into the script . the one line i liked the best , is when lithgow is warning the kid about how tough the government agents could be when they grill you : " they'll lock you in a room and then they'll throw away the room . " the tense scene back in the science lab consists of all the usual melodramatics seen in most typical action films , but what makes this film a little bit different , is that there have actually been seven fatalities at nuclear plants across america , even though this information is not widely known by the public . i use as my source of reference , for this information , dr . michio kaku , professor of theoretical physics , at ccny . so even if the film sunk rapidly into the pits of a pointless preachy exercise about nuclear dangers , there still was something absorbing about these nuclear scientists seen doing their job . and it was , at least , not one of those awful summer teenager movies . in fact , the acting was quite good in spots , especially , by christopher collet ; he convinced me he was a smart kid , while john lithgow convinced me that he was a scientist with a warm heart . 
1	nothing like low expectations to enhance your movie-going pleasure . invited to a special theatrical screening of bharat nalluri's the crow : salvation , recently released on tape and dvd , i wasn't particularly looking forward to it . although i wouldn't quite go so far as to recommend it , the movie does have a terrific look and some intriguing , albeit overly dramatic , acting . the script is so over the top that it would probably work better for an animated movie than a live-action production . think of the film as a cross between dark city and a charles bronson revenge thriller . shot impressively by carolyn chen , the movie has a striking look of dark blues shrouded in fog . the red of the ever-present blood serves as the main contrast to the film's bluish tint . if you rent the movie and you find the story a bit too ludicrous , you can always enjoy the visuals . it is rated r for pervasive strong violence and for sexual content and language . it would be acceptable for older teenagers . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
0	rollo knows what the public wants -- violence . downsizing . this nonplusses the zoo's animal keepers . fierce creatures can loosely be called a sequel to 1988's very popular a fish called wanda . rollo is played with a dead pan style by john cleese , and rod is done with broad humor by kevin kline . palin , whom i normally like , gives a performance so gratingly bad that i was ready to kill him . the setup for the story has much promise , but the delivery is horribly flawed . the script by john cleese and iain johnstone feels like it went through a long series of rewrites , but not enough . the resulting hodgepodge of vignettes has little coherence and remarkably few laughs . directed at first by robert young and later by fred schepisi , the film lacks the requisite energy to give punch to the jokes . if the film were chopped into pieces , the segments might work on their own , but taken together they tire more than amuse . better is the effect that willa has on him -- his tongue gets confused and sexual words come out by mistake . most of the jokes are so lame that i found that i became more interested in checking my watch than waiting for the next comedy skit . let's hope they do not attempt another remake unless they have a script worth filming . it is rated pg-13 for language and numerous sexual innuendo . the film would be fine for kids ten and up . the best part of this show for me was that it ended so i give it thumbs down and a generous * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : march 29 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	it doesn't make any difference how late , your friend won't miss anything since the movie plays like an uneventful three hundredth episode of a soap opera that you've never seen before . don't get me wrong , there are a lot of things to admire in the film , written and directed by anh hung tran ( cyclo ) , but all of these are associated with the film's look . they are unusual in more ways than one . this slightly moving tableaux is a treat for your eyes , but your mind will leave quite unsatisfied . and the length ! almost two hours . this brings us to my first rule for filmmakers . if you don't have anything to say , at least say it quickly . vertical ray of the sun runs a long 1 : 53 . the film is in vietnamese with english subtitles . it is rated pg-13 for thematic elements and some sex-related material . it would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up , but kids of any age are unlikely to find much to hold their attention . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
2	his menacing sneers are unforgetable , adding spice to a feature that makes grand use of every shot taken , and for its very limited budget of $75 , 000 , equals in style and eloquence the highest budgeted films of that era . kubrick has created a sinister noir film , employing dark angle shots and a hand held camera , which is used effectively in the street scenes where he probably didn't have official permission to be filming . it is a surprisingly well-made film , especially considering its low-budget constraints and the very independent way it was produced . it is one of my favorite noir films ; it had something about it that i enjoyed that goes beyond its taut story and authencity , it reminded me so much of how the 1950s were a time of alienation and failed dreams for youngsters who were trying to capitalize on the boom times after ww11 . 
0	screenplay : todd phillips and scot armstrong . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , adult humor , profanity ) running time : 92 minutes . it is part of a grand tradition of leering , sniggering comedies in which the anti-social behavior and hormone-fueled idiocy of 18-year-olds ( portrayed by 25-year-olds ) are celebrated for the entertainment of 15-year-olds . but i remember a time when such tales were sublimely crude ( animal house ) rather than ridiculously crude ( american pie ) , when the goal was celebrating an anarchic spirit rather than seeing how much bodily fluid you could get away with in an r-rated film . pushing the envelope , farrelly brothers-style , can be fun ; stuffing the envelope to the point that it requires hundreds of dollars in postage can become a simple , wearying exercise in " can we get away with this ? " if you belong to that demographic that finds a joke most appealing when it's accompanied by a groan of disgust , have we got a treat for you . i believe it should go without saying that the quartet takes a few detours before reaching texas . most of those detours involve the sacred duo of collegiate intemperance : mood-altering substances and sex . only it's just not all that funny . unlike the pointlessly message-mongering american pie , road trip never pretends to be anything more than a cesspool of moral depravity . it's even refreshing in a twisted way that the girl who seduces josh -- inspiring the cross-country recovery mission in the first place -- actually becomes the film's heroine , daring to suggest that sexually aggressive women can also be nice people . but road trip's singularity of purpose doesn't translate into much manic energy . its low-brow set pieces are pitched at obvious incongruities : the pairing of rail-thin kyle with his substantial ladyfriend , an old man sporting an obvious erection , the macho e . l . there's not much of a sense of comic discovery to road trip's gags ; they're the gags teenagers are expected to laugh at . deserved kudos do go to tom green , the mtv variety show host-cum-circus geek who plays the demented barry . green's act can be off-putting , but he's surprisingly funny as the perpetual undergrad with an unhealthy obsession with rubin's pet python ( " unleash the fury " has already become part of my film-based lexicon ) . his scenes are some of the only moments in road trip where you can't be sure exactly what's going to happen next . the rest of this trip meanders through some extremely familiar countryside , and not familiar in a way that inspires fond comparisons to classic genre cousins . road trip is comedy a level removed from anything that could be really funny , because it's all about how funny the mere idea of a profane , stoned dog could be . as the real classics of sophomoric humor have proved over the years , even when it comes to gross-outs , execution is everything . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	fans of the * real * james bond exulted -- at least until they saw the movie . the only stipulation was that it had to be based on the characters and situations of the original thunderball . the result , which has a hokey , jokey feel , is possibly the worst-written bond script of all ( barring the satirical mess called casino royale ) . unfortunately , never say never again is a poor excuse for the veteran actor's return . the humor is over-the-top , the direction is pedestrian , and the storyline drags . were it not for the simple pleasure of seeing connery playing 007 one more time , this film would have been nearly unwatchable . all things considered , it's not a very good movie , but at least connery's charisma salvages parts of it . while the skeleton of never say never again resembles that of thunderball -- spectre steals two nuclear missiles and blackmails the world -- many of the details are different . in fact , those who haven't seen the 1965 film recently might not even recognize the connection . even bond has changed subtly -- given connery's age , he's better at delivering puns than punches . the hallmarks of every bond film are the big , often-absurd action sequences . never say never again can boast only one - - a wild car chase with bond on a q-designed motorbike -- and that's choreographed without flair . with the exception of a few isolated incidents here and there , like the silly fight that demolishes a health clinic , this film fails to generate much excitement . the acting is variable . brandauer is effective as largo and max von sydow may be the best blofeld of all . kim basinger is a singular embarrassment , not exhibiting the slightest wisp of acting talent . it's especially odd seeing someone other than desmond llewelyn tinkering with gadgets . there was a great deal of hype in 1983 about the " dueling " bonds -- roger moore's octopussy versus sean connery's never say never again . ultimately , both entries were duds , with never say never again offering slightly better entertainment based solely on connery's presence . nevertheless , it's a major disappointment that , having lured back the original 007 , the film makers couldn't offer him something better than this drawn-out , hackneyed story . 
2	the young kid doesn't know what to say . yang-yang is not only the namesake of the director , but speaks for him in this film . so how can i know what you see ? " at one point of the film the director through the character who reacts the most emotional , the very thin " fatty , " tells his movie date that movies are not a waste of time , but enrich one's life . they even increase your life three times because the movies tell us about things we could never possibly know . he gives one example of murder , but that didn't go over too well with ting-ting . this one is a masterpiece , despite it being as inexplicable as a great work of music sometimes is . it lays out the grief facing a problematic family and we see it happening , but we never quite understand why ; and , we will have to accept as an answer that is because individuals are very complex and if they can't tell us what is on their mind , we can only guess what they are thinking . and , isn't that the way you find it with many people ? maybe finding happiness isn't so simple a matter . maybe we are destined to follow a certain course and even if given a second chance would still make the same mistakes . the director knows that we are all unique and have our own way of seeing things , and he respects that . but whatever , there was a certain raw , undefinable power that this great filmmaker has that makes this story fulfilling ; even if , we are never quite sure if we are fulfilled by what we saw . but one thing is certain , you can't put this iconoclastic filmmaker in a box and label him . i wouldn't miss this one . as entertaining a film as crouching tiger . . . was , it didn't have this film's depth and poignancy . 
2	the modern-day family isn't what it used to be . households that mirror the cleavers--or even the huxtables or seavers--deserve a place on the endangered species list . there are times when the movie's statement about the tragic lot of children torn between a mother and father is almost lost amidst the upsurge of feel-good sentiment . don't expect much substance or depth from this film--the few questions it poses are never answered satisfactorily , and the story is framed in a manner designed to please crowds , not address issues . there's a saying that laughter is the best medicine , and it's certainly true in this case . bye bye love's humor obfuscates many dramatic shortcomings . it's hard to dislike something that provokes this many laughs . flawed though it may be , the movie does a good job filling the " light entertainment " niche . for the most part , the story is told from the male point-of-view . the comedy starts slowly , with occasional solid one-liners and sight gags ( one hint that the film has promise is that most of these work ) . however , just before the half-way point , vic embarks on one of those motion picture cliches , the " blind date from hell . " though nothing that happens between these two erupts with originality , and many of the jokes are telegraphed , the vic/lucille scenes are hilarious . quaid and garofalo create an effective rapport , each playing perfectly off the other . the only downside is that they aren't on screen all the time . an entire movie could have been made with just these two characters , and it probably would have been a far better film than bye bye love . paul reiser essentially regurgitates his mad about you personae . there are a few wrinkles , but this is a " safe " role that doesn't require much of a stretch . unfortunately , matthew modine is barely adequate , so dave's scenes are often the least enjoyable . product placement has become a common practice for films like this , but bye bye love goes way overboard in advertising for mcdonald's . the golden arches are lovingly highlighted , and there's a nice close-up of a sign advertising extra value meals for $2 . 99 . such blatant commercialism is annoying . dramatic comedies are hollywood staples , but most fall short by diluting straight and amusing elements on an equal basis . while bye bye love has its share of problems , feeble jokes and unfunny humor aren't among them . despite only partially succeeding in its examination of the potentially-damaging effects of divorce , the end result is still a pleasant film that satisfies a need for cheery , unforced entertainment . 
0	it's a one joke movie that quickly runs out of steam , as the cloying humor soon becomes insipid and the comic situation turns out to be more ridiculous than funny . it's a star vehicle effort , so if you like de niro and crystal , then you have a chance of falling for the film's silly premise and not caring how inane the dialogue is . the shrink is absolutely frightened of vitti and wants no part of it , which is a source for much of the film's early humor . >from here on the story has no place to go but downhill , the jokes quickly fade , and the pacing of the film drags . the film is loaded with sight gags , clashes of culture between the educated jewish doctor and the tough-guy italians . there are many mafia type of jokes , stereotypes of italian gangsters , and many other routines about the mob that have been seen in a host of other mob films . the scene wasn't funny , believable , or watchable . i don't think the director knew how to end this satire with any credibility . the film just ran out of one-liners and ways to be irreverent to the mob , the f . b . i . , and the psychoanalysts . the jokes might even seem funnier late at night . the film just wasn't involving enough to work as drama , but if it's a few laughs that you are after , then this film delivers . de niro has a good eye for parody and is the best thing about the film . crystal seems to be miscast . viterelli and kudrow add light touches of comedy in their supporting roles . the funniest bit , i thought , was of de niro crying over a television commercial , thinking it was so much like his real-life situation . 
1	screenplay : james demonaco and kevin fox . producers : arnon milchan and david hoberman . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 137 minutes . sometimes it's obvious that a film isn't about the plot , it's about the names above the title . cocktail was no more a coming-of-age story than it was a geopolitical thriller ; it was about tom cruise smiling and mixing drinks . up close and personal was about as interested in journalistic ethics as the national enquirer ; it was really about robert redford and michelle pfeiffer sharing soft-focus love scenes . and could you differentiate between any two non-terminator schwarzenegger action films with a gun to your head ? for better or for worse -- more often the latter , contemporary hollywood films often sell personalities rather than stories . no , the negotiator is about a showdown between jackson and spacey , two actors whose intensity and burning intelligence make them magnetically watchable . even with theatrical trailers awash in spraying bullets and shattering glass , you expect that the real warfare will be psychological , a chess match as much between jackson and spacey as between the characters they play . if the negotiator had delivered on that promise , it would have been one of those rare exceptions where a " personality plot " would have been the right choice . for all the sound and fury surrounding both the conspiracy and the attempts to take roman by force , the negotiator is built on the clash of two characters who win not by shooting faster , but by thinking faster , by turning words into their most effective weapons . jackson and spacey take the two similar roles and turn them into distinct individuals so deftly that the slices of family life provided as back-story seem embarrassingly clumsy by contrast . the flicker of instability which makes it possible to believe he'd kill contrasts perfectly with the icy resolve of spacey's sabian . when those two characters lock wits and eyes , each struggling to size the other up and determine whether he's an ally or an adversary , the negotiator is compelling stuff . those moments just don't come nearly often enough . spacey doesn't make his first appearance until nearly 45 minutes have passed , leaving plenty of time for the film to detour onto well-worn action-suspense avenues . though paul giamatti ( fast becoming the most recognizable unknown actor in movies ) provides solid comic relief as a con artist among roman's hostages , even the one-liners further emphasize that this drama really isn't anything special . it could have been and should have been more than another die hard clone , more than an over-long mystery where you begin to feel you should leave as soon as you figure out the real bad guy . the negotiator should have played to the strength of its cast , with more scenes of roman reducing his colleagues to blubbering bowls of putting , or sabian taking control of a room with the force of his confidence . it's a disappointing reverse-tease : with two great stars to show off , it has the nerve to go and offer us a plot . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
1	in the 1990s , lumet's films ( q & a , a stranger among us , guilty as sin , and night falls on manhattan ) have all been disappointments , even if each has had parts worth treasuring . his latest , critical care , fits firmly within his repertoire for this decade . spader is convincing as the latter , but his perfect hair , fashion model looks , flawless attire , and his relaxed demeanor makes it hard to believe that this is a guy who works 38 hours straight through . the dialog , although there are quite a few nice one-liners , generally falls flat . never quite entertaining , rarely enlightening , and only sporadically funny , the movie seems destined for a limited market . " where have you been all your life ? " " it's called revenue ! " the show has a similarly clever ending , but none of this makes up for the tedium of most of the picture . rather than seeing critical care , go and rent one of lumet's great films . it is rated r for language , adult themes , and sexual situations . the film would be fine for teenagers . 
0	bosnian-born writer/director emir kusturica ( time of the gypsies , underground ) has come up with a robust ( lively music and characters with plenty of energy ) but excessive screwball comedy with felliniesque touches here and there , and before the film literally goes in the shit , it was able to show some warm romantic moments and garner many laughs from its odd-looking and strangely-acting characters . grga pitic ( sabri sulejman ) is the old-wily patriarch enamored with the ending to the " casablanca " film , which he often watches on his video ( it could be said , that one of the film's themes could be about a beautiful friendship formed by a seemingly odd pair ) . the film comes replete with a happy ending , as noted onscreen by the ending saying just that . the two cats appear as the title and are seen constantly crawling in and out of scenes , sometimes contributing in a comical way to what is happening onscreen . the film is sometimes a " keystone kops " comedy , like those old mack sennett films . the film just ran too long , close to two hours , for a story that shouldn't have been longer than 90- minutes . the group of gypsies were mostly nonprofessional actors , colorful characters , with their mouths filled with gold teeth , and a screen presence that was absurd and defying in logic . this original film offered something different to see , for a viewer who usually doesn't get to see real gypsies onscreen . it's a noisy comedy , with a loud brass band coming in at any time during the film . it takes suspension of belief on the part of the viewer to stick with this one for its complete romp across gypsy land , plus the skits become too labored to sustain the frenetic pace of the film . the characters make this film enjoyable . the gypsies are real humdingers ; they are always grinning ; and , while acting grotesque , they seem to be cruel , and ridiculous . the warm moment in the film , is the romance between branka and florijan , vanishing in a field of sunflowers . she's a live-wire , and when onscreen was a commanding presence . 
0	as disney loves to do , it is rereleasing to the big screen , an animated movie it has yet to release on video , oliver & company ( 1988 ) . why they decided to hold this one back for another theatrical run before it makes its inevitable transition to tape is beyond me . this is one of the weakest disney movies in years . why these juvenile delinquents and their even worse masters are considered appropriate material for the 3-8 set that is most likely to see this movie is a conundrum . dodger eventually will allow that , " hey , you're okay for a cat , " but at first considers him a pest . this is a little kids' show ? georgette's motto is , " perfect isn't easy , but it's me . " there are two good characters in the show , jenny and oliver , but most are mediocre . the ones of fagan and mr . sykes are inappropriate for young kid's movies . the film would have been stronger if both of these characters had been written out and the gang had led totally by dodger . moreover , fagan is so poorly written as to be an embarrassment . the script has few ideas and is bad need of a rewrite . the paucity of ideas is addressed by introducing unnecessarily frightening images . the drawings are colorful and pretty , especially in the night sequences . overall , however , they saved money way too often by making scenes where almost nothing moves , and they excessively pan the cameras to create the feel of action . a . c . redford ) itself is full of a heavy beat that will keep the kids moving with it , but the songs are imminently forgettable . it is rated g , but i would be very careful with kids under 5 lest they be significantly scared . my son jeffrey ( almost 7 ) liked the movie as he almost always does , but his dad was not impressed . i do not recommend it , but i generously award it * 1/2 because i don't want to be too tough on any film with a cute kitty . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	this weekend i saw jurassic park . i would give the dinos a * * * * rating as i never thought they were models or simulations and i will never forgot the awe inspiring sounds they made . as for the actors , director and especially the script , i would give them a * rating . overall i give the movie a * * * rating and wish the dinosaurs would have eaten all of the people except for say a narrator in the first 5 minutes of the show . on the other hand , if they had created people i cared about , well then i would have preferred them to live and interacted with the dinos . since i did not care if the people lived or died , the movie never scared me unlike aliens ( * * * * ) which scared the daylights out of me . now , what really bothered me in jurassic park were the stereotypes . doesn't sound like any of my friends . making a profit we are reminded means that you must put your workers in physical jeopardy , underpay them , and most of all rape the ecohsystem . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	teaming roberts up again with richard gere and director garry marshall , this movie , as everyone associated with it carefully points out , is not a sequel to pretty woman , the hit movie that started this decade . gere and roberts evidence enough genuine chemistry on the screen to fill a dozen run-of-the-mill romances . the script by sara parriott , josann mcgibbon and audrey wells is filled with some nice one liners and several delightfully quirky characters . as peggy fleming -- no , not that peggy fleming -- the owner of the " curl up and dye " beauty salon , joan cusack plays maggie's long-time best buddy and an unabashed weird character . the movie is filled with such well-constructed sight gags . roberts , with her glamorous looks , is so confident that she's willing to look ugly in the service of comedy . the surprise of the casting is that as lovely as roberts is , gere , with his thick gray , wavy hair , manages to outshine her . in fact , it is gere , not roberts , who steals most of their scenes . with a relaxed savoir-faire , gere gives himself a decided cary grant air . combatants at first , their relationship changes over the course of the good-spirited film , much to the delight of the audience . the laughs tend to come batched together , causing viewers to miss some delicious little zingers . oh well , you can catch them all when you rent it later . the one thing in which the audience feels confident is that , whatever she chooses , the results will be charming and humorous . they will not be disappointed . it is rated pg for language and some suggestive dialogue and would be fine for kids around 8 and up . my son jeffrey , age 10 , loved the movie and gave it * * * . he thought it was a little repetitious but had some good laughs that cracked him up . 
2	which would you rather get , the flu or the mumps ? &quot ; this is something that political cynics have long suspected . a perfect candidate is fascinating , if more than a little depressing . and , coming in the midst of a presidential campaign , its relevance is undeniable . in fact , if you believe his supporters , he arrived as a breath of fresh air -- a needed contrast to a washington insider like chuck robb . and robb was vulnerable . the fact that he didn't in no way diminishes the importance of this film or what it has to say about american politics . even those who disdain stepping into the voting booth will find much to mull over in cutler and taylor's film . as the election approaches , he confides to the film makers that , in his opinion , all anyone cares about is the entertainment value of politics . candidates are obsessed with the &quot ; show&quot ; of elections , not the presentation of serious solutions to important issues . baker's comments are especially noteworthy . i don't normally comment on the technical limitations of documentaries , but a problem with a perfect candidate deserves mention , because it is distracting . the movie was originally shot on video , then transferred to 35 mm film . as a result , the tops and bottoms of the 4 : 3 image have been cropped to fit a 1 . 85 : 1 screen . unfortunately , this frequently causes the heads of speakers to be cut off . it's not a major problem , but it does create moments of consternation . perhaps a perfect candidate will look better on tv ( provided the original image is properly restored ) . framing problems aside , a perfect candidate is a startling , sad commentary about american politics . if nothing else , this film will bring an entirely new perspective to every move and countermove of the current election . i may not be allowed behind the scenes of clinton/dole ( yet ) , but movies like a perfect candidate offer enough information to allow me to make some depressingly informed guesses . -- ingmar bergman 
2	in a time when intelligent family pictures are at a premium , intelligent african american family pictures are virtually nonexistent . blending sepia-toned nostalgia with harder-hitting , passionate themes , reid has crafted a portrait of growing up in the middle-of-the-century south the likes of which is rarely found in any medium . in once upon a time , a sense of quiet dignity has replaced the rage that often typifies films targeted for black audiences . yet this movie is no less emotive or potent because of it . issues of equality , fairness , and self-respect form the cornerstones of the defining subtext for this coming-of-age story . although once upon a time is rooted in a setting that will have greater resonance for black americans , much of what this film says has universal scope and intent . although once upon a time is occasionally disjointed , and some of the transitions are abrupt , it nevertheless offers a compelling chronicle of one man's growth into adulthood during volatile times , when courageous men and women began challenging an unjust system . as with most episodic movies , certain segments leave a more lasting impression than others . this is immediately followed by a kkk march , one of the film's few grim , tense scenes . there's a wonderfully festive sunday picnic characterized by food , games , and good times . the film is highlighted by a pair of strong performances . technically , once upon a time rarely shows its monetary constraints , although , considering tim reid's struggle to put together the film's budget , it's amazing how good it looks . in cliff's words , " all that i am or ever will be comes from growing up with my extended family in . . . colored that simple statement embodies the core of the film's message to viewers of all races and generations . 
2	so how many really good movies can you name about brother-sister relationships ? and what if you limit your list to only those about adult siblings ? don't be surprised if your list is empty , or at least close to it . in the future , any such list will have to start with you can count on me , the winner for best picture and best screenplay at this year's sundance film festival . written and directed by ken lonergan ( the writer of last year's hit comedy analyze this ) , you can count on me is a rich and witty drama whose centerpiece is a sibling relationship . but this isn't one of those dysfunctional families movies , even if their relationship does have its difficult moments . this is a story of love , not hate . the chemistry between them and between terry and rudy is remarkable and genuine . sammy has had a modestly successful life , but terry is a screw-up , although he claims , as if he doesn't believe it , that " i'm not the kind of guy that everyone says i am . " " what are you talking about , " rudy asks him with soulful , confused eyes . " i have no idea , " terry confesses in a bit of self-reflection . the beauty of the delicate script is the way tragedy is consistently downplayed and that key incidents are merely sketched out . the writer allows us to use our imagination to fill in the details . and the direction is done with great subtly and finesse so that there isn't an overacted or schmaltzy moment in the production . the result is a picture so authentic that it has the audience hitting the ground running . only a few minutes into it , and we feel like we've known and cared about these people all of our lives . linney delivers this line with heart-felt but restrained emotions , making it feel as genuine as if she were talking about her own dead mother . his is an anal-retentive type , who admits that " i like paperwork . " he wants daily time cards and a conservative color palette for the bank's pc displays . besides writing and directing , lonergan also plays the part of sammy's laid back priest , the funniest character in the movie . linney , with some of the spunk that holly hunter demonstrated in broadcast news , delivers a delicately nuanced and wonderfully appealing performance that deserves to be remembered at oscar time . but you want to see this movie now and not wait until the nominations come out to remind you of the great movies that you missed . you can count on me runs 1 : 49 . it is rated r for language , some drug use and a scene of sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers . 
0	that's about as funny as inspector gadget ever gets . disney's new live-action movie pins all of its hopes for laughter on such sight gags . as the gadget-laden hero , inspector gadget , poor matthew broderick is stuck yet again in a movie in which he delivers an awkward performance in an underwritten role . broderick invests little emotional energy in the part of a guy whose reconstructed body is a collection of gadgets and gizmos . the quality of a script is usually inversely proportional to the number of writers , and this screenplay is no exception . the dialog packs no punch whatsoever , leaving the physical comedy alone to carry the picture . the one-joke movie consists of having inspector gadget , a kid's version of robocop , demonstrating all of his hardware . the result is a movie with a laugh count of maybe one or two small chuckles . as written , was the project doomed ? perhaps not . consider , for a minute , what it might have become with brendan fraser . willing to risk looking completely ridiculous , fraser usually dazzles us with his comedic bravado . still , even the usually reliable rupert everett , who plays the movie's villain , claw , doesn't show much spark in his acting . there is one undeniably enjoyable part of the production . it doesn't last long . it is rated pg for wacky violence/action , language and innuendo and would be fine for kids of all ages . my son jeffrey , age 10 , gave the movie * * 1/2 , complaining that it didn't have enough action , comedy or mystery . his buddy nickolas , age 10 , gave the film * * * . he thought the movie needed more action , but he really liked the talking car in it . 
2	it is said that every man or woman has at least one story to tell ; this is duvall's . the actor filled nearly every role imaginable on this production ? in addition to financing it , he starred in it , directed it , executive produced it , and wrote it . for duvall , the apostle is not just a movie , it is * the * movie . a relatively simple tale about a far-from-simple character , the apostle never falters in its portrayal of euliss " sonny " dewey ( duvall ) as a real , flesh-and-blood human being . it does not patronize or satirize . it is respectful without being reverential . the apostle is a character study , and , like all motion pictures of this sort , its ultimate success depends upon how compelling the protagonist is . as essayed by duvall , arguably one of america's ten-best living actors , sonny is the kind of complex individual we could watch for hours on end without ever losing interest . like many flawed heroes , sonny is a good man who is haunted by one tragic mistake . sonny has moments of weakness , but his sincerity never wavers , even when his ministry flourishes and the temptation for self-aggrandizement grows . watching sonny lead revivals , it's easy to understand the appeal of an energetic preacher , and how some of the most popular achieve a status not unlike that of a rock star . it is a testimony to duvall's reputation in the business that he was able to gather such an impressive cast for a low-budget , low-profile motion picture . in his long and distinguished career , only his oscar-winning performance in 1983's tender mercies was this raw . the energy and passion of a preacher are all present . duvall has devoted a great deal of time and effort into getting the details right . to enhance the apostle's verisimilitude , he relied primarily on non-professional church-goers and evangelists ( rather than experienced actors ) in supporting roles . for the picture's style , he admits to being inspired by the near-documentary quality of ken loach's films . as a result , the apostle possesses a truer and more intimate feel than it would have with slick camerawork . the apostle is not the kind of movie that provokes a profound change in the viewer , but it offers a balanced portrait of a unique personality . sonny is not easily forgotten and , when the oscar nominations are announced , it's possible that duvall won't be , either . - ingmar bergman 
1	children of heaven ( bacheha-ye aseman ) , written and directed by majid majidi , is less a movie than a visual pantomime of a short story . the thin narrative and sparse dialog almost dares critics not to like it by imbuing just about every character with near sainthood . add in the amateurish acting , and you would seem to have a recipe for a film that will cause people to smile politely and try think of kind things to say . the director does fashion a few nice visuals . another lovely little image has kids blowing soap bubbles at each other . too often , however , he runs out of ideas and just films the same ugly alleyway , again and again . using little dialog , the film sticks to the visuals to tell the bulk of its story . the movie's best sequence occurs when the father gets inside the gates and views the exterior of one of the elaborate homes . many obvious questions are never answered . the movie does contain one amazing scene . we actually see the kids doing homework ! kids all over america do this everyday -- except in american movies . children of heaven runs just 1 : 28 . the film is in persian with english subtitles . it is not rated but would be a g since nothing even remotely offensive occurs . the picture would be fine for all ages , but kids would probably need to be at least 9 to be interested . 
1	the claustrophobic and static movie is in bad need of some opening up . this isn't helped by the music choices , which are uniformly disconcerting and just flat all wrong . after spending time listening to these four unknowns party , you will feel like cassandra , who remarks to charlie , " i am so sick of this . " me too . it is not rated but would be an r for hard drug usage , violence , language and sexual situations . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
1	for most people , the years spent at college are those of exploration and discovery . confusion and heartbreak are as vital to the maturation process as understanding and joy . in this film , john singleton has chosen to look beneath the peaceful veneer of college life , but the narrative that emerges is decidedly unbalanced . focusing almost exclusively on the violent , negative aspects , it ignores many of the positives . viewing higher learning , we get little sense of community . columbus seems to be a place where people go to have bad things happen to them . true , they are stereotypes , but singleton , as an accomplished filmmaker , is able to imbue his characters with a vitality that allows them to escape the boundaries which might normally constrain them . each grows and evolves , albeit predictably . it doesn't take much convincing before the lonely remy joins the skinheads and embraces their racist creed . perhaps higher learning tries to cram too much into two hours . on top of that , in striving for a gut-wrenching finale , singleton pushes the issue of racial tension to a violent climax . on most college campuses today , there is racism , but it smolders and simmers , rarely reaching this sort of explosive level . this ending feels forced and overplotted . the tragic , ironic twist that punctuates the film is anything but surprising . in fact , most of what happens in the final fifteen minutes is easily predicted . the film also loses an element of potency in its depiction of the main antagonists . the skinheads are presented as one-dimensional caricatures . as a result , the audience's enmity is equally as shallow . in schindler's list , steven spielberg recognized that one key to a powerful drama is a fleshed-out villain . similarly , the skinheads of romper stomper were frightening because of their realism . they serve a function in the plot , but little more . solid acting abounds , and helps immeasurably when the script weakens . none of the three main performers displays an overabundance of talent , but all are more than equal to their roles . singleton's views of modern college life are considerably better- rounded than those presented by many recent pictures ( pcu and threesome leap to mind ) . despite excesses and missteps , there is still a wealth of digestible , thought-provoking material in higher learning . the best parts tend to be the most subtle ones--racism shown by a glance or friendship by a kind word . when this movie is quiet and introspective , it speaks with a clear voice . that insight gets muddled , however , the more forceful singleton becomes . 
2	most cross-dressing comedies are played for broad laughs . tootsie is an example , as is the recent mrs . doubtfire . in both cases , transvestism as a plot device is a means to an end--and that end is humor . the sight of dustin hoffman or robin williams in drag is intended to bring on fits of mirth . just like a woman , however , has a different perspective , and while there are chuckles aplenty , they're likely not for the same reasons . the movie starts out much like a " traditional " romantic comedy . just like a woman takes great pains to treat the subject of transvestism with a modicum of sensitivity , while avoiding taking a preachy stance . the gerald/geraldine transformations are not presented farcically , but with a care to show how important this part of his life is to the main character . ultimately , monica doesn't have a problem with this--in fact , once she gets used to it , she starts to enjoy it . the comedy is uneven . some of the most clever bits are the less- obvious ones , such as the use of the song " devil in disguise " during one scene , or a double entendre about " dressing " on a salad . on the other hand , there are two sequences--one involving a hypnotist and another occurring during a board meeting--where things get too silly , crossing the line from funny to ridiculous . mostly , when just like a woman concentrates on the gerald/monica relationship , it's on safe ground . however , there's another half to the story . this subplot , which involves backstabbing and in-fighting at gerald's place of work , takes up a lot of unnecessary time . it isn't particularly engaging , and its ultimate purpose is to afford the opportunity for a disappointing , " crowd-pleasing " ending . adrian pasdar does a credible job , playing gerald/geraldine with dignity instead of going over-the-top . in frocks and makeup , he passes quite effectively as a female ( and is decidedly less homely than dorothy in tootsie ) . just like a woman isn't really about tolerance , although that comes into it . this was intended as a romantic comedy with a slightly different spin , and in that aim , it is successful . unfortunately , the secondary storyline can't be brushed aside easily , given its importance to the finale . the result is a moderate diminution of the movie's more enjoyable aspects . 
1	locally , the ballad of ramblin' jack has been attracting some of the biggest audiences that i've ever seen for a documentary . ( yes , i'm excluding the blair witch project , which isn't a documentary no matter what its fans want to believe . ) why this documentary is so popular , while many much better ones haven't been as well attended , is a bit of a mystery . but as one whose favorite film genre is documentaries , i'm pleased . personally , i found jack's singing abilities to be -- well -- passable . the ballad of ramblin' jack feels less like a motion picture than the elliott's home movies as narrated by the daughter . i can recall few documentaries in which the director talked so much . if her insights were more significant , her domination of her movie would have been easier to overlook . good documentaries can transcend their subject material to make the seemingly uninteresting fascinating . errol morris's mesmerizing mr . death about an electric chair designer was the best recent example of this . aiyana elliott is an effective collector of material and a good music historian , but her skills as a filmmaker aren't what they should be . this music documentary must then rise or fall solely on its music footage . some of it is quite good , but the director keeps cutting away . which leads me to a conclusion similar to my advice about bittersweet motel , a much inferior music documentary about the rock band phish . the ballad of ramblin' jack is for folk fans only . it is not rated but would be a g since it contains nothing to offend anyone of any age . 
1	the net result is that they spend more time bickering about it than doing it . as waiter and would-be actor joe , matthew modine gives a witty and wise performance . they will both will be tempted by others -- he by a madonna body double and she by a women's self-defense instructor , played by a remarkably low-key denis leary . as just one example , she finds the little mermaid and all of the disney cartoons quite spiritual . the movie is filled with known actors in small performances that are more than cameos but less than major parts . steve buscemi takes the role of a music video director . joe , who seems most interested in the harassment issue , keeps reading the lingerie and other ads and developing deep sounding but superficial theories about their demeaning women . if the story sounds disorganized , it is . written and directed by tom dicillo from box of moonlight , the movie meanders , not going anyplace in particular . some of the jokes work while others fall flat . this funny scene works so well because it is at once outlandish and realistic . when has someone not praised a movie that you hated , but you tried to be polite and kept your opinions to yourself or at least muted what you had to say ? but for every good scene like the one above , there are others with promise but no laughs . the joke is that she doesn't attack him at all , which probably sounded funny in the script but is staged with little style or impact . although the light-weight film doesn't have much compelling material , the cast gives it their all . the result is a periodically funny picture that does have its entertaining moments . it is rated r for nudity , sex and profanity and would be fine for most teenagers . 
0	summer catch isn't . a lackluster twist on the old baseball classic bull durham , the movie features a bunch of young heartthrobs cast to attract just the right demographics . it stars pretty boy freddie prinze jr . who has one of least impressive track records around . the only movie that i ever remember liking him in was she's all that . as directed by michael tollin and written by kevin falls and john gatins , the picture doesn't have a single original idea . the spoken dialog isn't much better . the film has trouble deciding what kind of movie it wants to be . sometimes , it wants to be a cleaned up version of porky's . to accomplish that with a pg-13 rating , the guys don thong bikini panties -- don't ask -- to show off their derri ? res , and the girls are seen in bras and wet t-shirts . at other times , the movie thinks it's about the sport of baseball with serious scouts in the stands hanging on every pitch . still other times , it tries to be a study of the debilitating effects of class consciousness in america , as some of the actors show 100-year-old english class sensibilities . playing in a supposedly very important collegiate summer league , which has less than a hundred fans , ryan hopes to be picked up by a major league team . the only semi-decent performance in the picture comes from brian dennehy as ryan's coach . there isn't one scintilla of chemistry between the love birds and not much between ryan and the sport with which he is supposedly so infatuated . the ending will likely have baseball fans shaking their heads in disbelief . 
2	solas , by writer/director benito zambrano , would have been more appropriately released in the united states under its translated title , alone , which perfectly captures the message and the mood of this slender but touching tale that feels like a short story brought to the screen . this only serves to further infuriate mar ? a . as unlikable as mar ? a tries to be , she wins our hearts since you can tell that she is a sad product of her environment . nevertheless , they do share a few precious , if brief , times together . if there is a quibble to be made about such a heart-warming tale , it is that mar ? a dresses and acts a bit too middle-class for all of her professed poverty . but there are no complaints possible about the performances , which are all heart-felt and moving . mar ? a's arc in the story , while predictable , is nonetheless poignant and honest . correctly guessing her transformation does not diminish its impact . " god's given us one more day . " and you'll be thankful if you are fortunate enough to catch this lovely little story . the film is in spanish with english subtitles . it is not rated but would be an r for mature themes and brief sexuality . 
1	a heartfelt australian romance story about a mentally ill couple , which won seven australian academy awards , including best picture , actor , actress and director . there are many magnificent scenes of them showing their love for each other in a sensitive and witty way , also showing how fragile and insecure they are . the director shows how the outsiders only seem to harm them , even when they are trying to be fair with them and offer them sound advise . but we can rest assured that this is not going to be a clich ? movie about the mentally ill and how they manage , as the acting remains controlled and is too earthy for the story to become compromised by a sugary resolution . this is a sensitive film . the director-writer , rymer , makes sure that our sympathies lie entirely with the struggling couple without making the outsiders into monsters . its beauty lies in how honestly the story is told and in showing how difficult it is to find love and then lose it through something you have no control over . it's an absorbing film , that is well-acted and directed , but it is not a film that you might care to remember . it lacked real affection for the couple , as they seemed forced down our throats instead of being allowed to grow gradually on us . having pity for them , is not the same as really caring for them . 
1	could it be that he's been chain-smoking pot the whole time ? curtis hanson's wonder boys , scripted by steven kloves and based on michael chabon's novel , is an eclectic collection of quirky characters and incidents that never amount to anything . unlike rushmore , wonder boys forgets to be funny . with a worn face like a well-read novel and with a tendency to pass out , grady doesn't exactly seem the type that would attract a series of women , but he does . the story heaps on strange little episodes and quirky characters like planting masses of seeds in the garden with the hopes that some of them will germinate , but few do . one scene has a character flipping the dial on the television . sadly , you realize that what's on the tube is more interesting that the movie itself . the predictable story has old-fashioned writers who eschew computers , preferring typewriters instead . grady doesn't make any copies of his tome . any guess what will happen in one of the scenes ? the movie spends the whole time setting up the plot . when the ending credits roll , you realize that it was never able to get in gear . i must confess that i have a personal hang-up about comedies . if they aren't funny , i have trouble liking them , no matter how well cast they are . and there aren't many laughs in the rambling wonder boys , or any characters worth caring about . it is rated r for language and drug content and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
2	liam neeson , in a tender and understated performance , plays ethan . liam gives a carefully constructed characterization of a long-suffering man who has relegated his life's ambitions to his wife's needs . joan allen , who plays the weak and sickly better than almost anyone , is zeena , ethan's insufferable wife . allen's zeena is extremely easy to hate and despise . zeena is so irritating that even the most fervent anti-adulterer will empathize with ethan's need to abandon her and run to mattie for love and companionship . brown has just the right delicate hand not to overwhelm the subtleties of the story , based on the edith wharton novel . the snow becomes both the most beautiful and the most frightening aspect . freezing cold , it makes ethan's florida dream palpably desirable and yet far removed from any possible reality for him . even when you know it is coming , it still takes your breath away . it is rated pg for mature themes and would be fine for kids 10 and up although they would probably need to be teenagers to be interested . 
0	petulia plays like a soap opera , set in san francisco during the late 1960s . it has a few gratuitous shots of janis joplin and big brother & the holding company plus the grateful dead , playing to a largely non-hippie audience . it is , indeed , mind-boggling to have so little acid rock in a film pretending to be about the mod '60s . the film reminded me most of a general hospital sudser , with a few noted nicolas roeg cinematography tricks , pre-performance , thrown in to give it a deeper look than the picture merited , such as jump cuts , time frame changes back and forth and forward , leaving one with a disjointed feeling about when events actually took place . the innovations , which make the film seem unconventional , all come about through the visual rhythm of the film rather than through the story itself . the good thing about david's parents , is that the father is joseph cotten and it's always great to hear his uniquely rich voice on the screen . there is no explanation for the continuous flashbacks and flash-forwards , as confusion reigns as a form of hipness . if you ask me , i thought this film was more claptrap than anything else . but enjoyable claptrap . it was easy to take , and even if the story didn't go anywhere , it did catch something unique about the 1960s that wasn't seen in other films -- how the wealthy took to the changes without the usual ways of rebelling . she had a craziness about her that made her pause to take stock of her life , but not enough to be a drop-out . a socialite's kookiness , will you . george c . scott looked grumpy for most of the film , but seemed to gain a little of the revolutionary spirit of the times every time he was with the kooky petulia . aside from the brilliant performances , this surreal-styled film , with its successful flashbacks but not so successful flash-forwards , was rather a disorientated and emotionally cold film . it was impossible to warm up to these elusive and neurotic characters , each trapped by fate or indecision . by the film's end , the same problems that existed in the beginning were still present . george c . scott is still chasing something that he is not sure of . they all have quirky personalities , but they are all straight and it seems odd that a film so grounded in the '60s actually missed having truly representative characters of that age . i thought the film was too cutely done and lacked depth . 
2	if you wanted to redo your past , how would you know what to change ? this research isn't as straightforward as it seems . at her house , the story first demonstrates its ability to surprise and delight the audience . some things that seem obvious prove to be anything but . these surprises make for some of the movie's best humor . using flashbacks , dream sequences and alternative versions of what could have been , the movie keeps the momentum going and the film never sags . there are also lots of delightful little subplots , including one about jesse , who is a professional chef , which concern his ability to cook without an oven . radiators , light bulbs and dishwashers prove perfectly acceptable substitutes for a traditional oven . although dead , anabeth , gets the most screen time through frequent flashbacks . her funeral provides the equivalent of the movie's big game conclusion . the good-spirited film doesn't try to provide big insights into life , although the messages are there nonetheless . the fun picture , which is happy just to entertain us , gives us more than our money's worth of laughs . with so many big budgeted hollywood films being so bad , it's nice to see the producers of a modestly budgeted picture trying to rock the boat by distributing the film themselves outside of the studio system . if the film comes to your area , don't miss it . and if it hasn't yet , ask for it . it isn't rated but will undoubtedly be an r for sex , nudity and language . the movie would be fine for older teenagers . 
1	interscope communications , the production company behind such films as the cutting edge and the air up there , has developed a reputation as a purveyor of feel-good , formula-reliant motion pictures . interscope's latest , roommates , isn't much of a departure from their standard fare--it's basically a buddy movie/romantic comedy/family drama all rolled into one . trying to cram so many stories into one-hundred eight minutes is an ambitious undertaking that results in sketchily-developed characters and half-realized relationships . falk is very convincing--and hardly recognizable--as rocky . makeup artist greg cannom has created old age applications that are far better than the norm , and the actor underneath all the latex imbues his body with a host of appropriate mannerisms . would that d . b . sweeney were as effective , since his single-note performance sucks the emotion out of several potentially-wrenching scenes . the plotline , which largely follows a familiar course , manages a few unexpected acts of commission or omission . one " twist " that i spent the whole movie waiting for never materialized , and something that happened took me a little by surprise . sadly , such bursts of freedom don't last long . through the film's peaks and valleys , this message is always there , either being disseminated through subtle and effective touches , or repeated in absurdly heavyhanded dialogue . roommates certainly isn't as good as it might have been , but it represents a game try at a different perspective on life and love , and offers an opportunity ( for those so inclined ) to shed a few tears . 
1	a stylishly slick , romantic thriller , that is pleasing to the senses in a brainless manner . you have to remember that this film was made in the radicalized 1960s and that reason for robbing a bank might have been accepted back then in some circles of thinking . there's a closing scene with a twist of betrayal that was much influenced by the style of french new wave films . but the film will not be remembered for its plot or the twists in it , but only for the good chemistry in it between the cary grant-like suave demeanor of mcqueen and the the cool disposition of the good looking dunaway . though the sex scenes were not very fleshy , it was mostly foreplay via dialogue , the film , nevertheless , still sold itself on this game of sex between the two amoral fortune hunters . the film also offered an oscar winning song scored by michael legrand , windmills of your mind , and some fancy camera work of split-screen images by cinematographer haskell wexler . but if you are looking for anything but a fun film , i think you'll be disappointed . it turns out to be an easily forgettable caper movie that was pleasing on the eyes as much as easy on the noodle . 
0	this is a poorly directed and scripted derivative casino heist movie , shamelessly stealing jokes , plot situations and shootout scenarios from many other such films , including " ocean's 11 , " " honeymoon in vegas , " " the limey , " and " reindeer games . " all the main characters are unappealing , even the young boy can't get over as someone appealing . but the most disheartening thing about this irrelevant flick , was its unethical conclusion and its totally amoral characterization of the film's stars . there is not one person worth too much in this motley crew of lowlifes . the only lame joke that made me laugh , was when one gang member asked , what's the advantage of dating a homeless woman ? the answer is , you can drop her off anywhere . this film is so ridiculous , that as one of the cynical fbi men wisecracks , after learning about murphy's rap sheet , " you can't make stuff like this up . " unfortunately the screenwriters lichtenstein and recco did , which makes for a particularly distasteful film . the only thing the film has going for it , is that the situation and the characters are so ludicrous and full of elvis twitches , that there is certain kind of enjoyment to be found in a film as bad as this one is -- that might be taken by some as a guilty pleasure . 
0	romance by writer/director catherine breillat is described in the press notes as " a daring exploration of female sexuality from a female point of view . " featuring an order of magnitude more explicit sex than any movie this side of a porn film , the graphic depictions are as joyless and unerotic as a medical textbook . even if breillat has her actors performing actual , not simulated , oral sex , she does it with such a clinical detachment that the only reason to applaud the film is for the risks it is willing to take . making it especially hard to endure , romance's energy level is as low as its depressed heroine's . certainly we have had a large number of movies than explore violence with graphic realism , so why can't similar ones be made with sexual realism ? after all , we as a society are much more threatened by violence than sex . whereas there is a case that can be made for making something this sexually explicit , this movie fails spectacularly . the heroine is one notch above an automaton , thanks to the remoteness of the director's approach . in an excessively serious picture that is never intentionally funny , these scenes of ropes and chains and marie's contorted positions may have some laughing out loud , since they are so ludicrous . he's a good listener . he has other boasts too , all equally bizarre . if you're inclined to check this movie out only because of the titillation factor , don't . there isn't an exciting moment to be found in it . on the contrary , monasteries might be advised to hold recruiting drives in the lobbies . if sex is this miserable , abstinence may be an attractive alternative . the film is in french with english subtitles . the movie , which was not submitted to the mpaa for rating , is filled with actual sex scenes and frequent nudity and would not be appropriate for anyone other than an adult . 
0	he is self-serving , he presents here a bitter picture about romance , but he mainly pokes fun at either himself or his fictionalized-self , going through his wide range of jokebook material on jewish neurotics , that is sometimes devilishly funny , sometimes as flat as matzoh , and sometimes done in just plain bad taste . this ill-conceived film has its funny moments , if one can get through woody's hubris and his putz-like mannerisms , that have a way of zinging you , as if you were around a schmuck who couldn't stop , even for a second from being who he is . but when i have given up all hope for this muddled mish-mash to amount to anything worthwhile , the " putz " gets off some acidly perceptive comments that go straight to the laugh belly . so what are you gonna say ? this is a woody allen movie , it is how he operates best , and this one ranks somewhere in the middle of his oeuvre . there are many stars that have cameos , and it works out well , they just do their routines and fit right into this rambling story , especially since it is safe to say that this is not a plot driven movie , in fact , the plot is incidental to the movie , if there wasn't a plot this would still be a movie about the neurotic behavior of mr . allen . so i find it unnecessary to try and explain the plot fully , except to say that woody writes books , using material from his marriages , with the movie going back and forth between woody and his real life situation and the characters he has in his book being played by different actors , for instance richard benjamin is the woody allen character harry , but with still a different name from that of the book . all the characters in his books are thinly disguised representatives of his real life movie situation . the film is worth seeing for woody's acerbic one-liners ; such as : all religions are just clubs . tradition is the illusion of permanence . you are the opposite of a paranoid-- you actually believe that people like you . and there are numerous other wise-cracks , that hit the right spot . so what's the big deal if the story is not so hot , and woody is a selfish-lout , don't kvetch , enjoy yourself , you don't have to be a nihilist to get a few yuks from this film .

2	billy bob thornton has presented me with a wonderful dilemma in sling blade : i don't know where to begin praising him . there are writers who get a shot at directing films , and actors who do some writing , and film-makers who take the occasional turn in front of a camera , but in most cases you can tell you are watching a writer direct , or an actor write , or a director act . in sling blade , you never feel as though you are watching a writer try to act , or an actor try to direct . you realize you are watching a natural born story-teller who understands that the words , the performers and the images are not discrete elements , but indivisible parts of a cohesive story . his setting , an insular southern town , is rendered with a vivid combination of characters and locations ; his characters , down to the last minor player , are given personalities uniquely their own . but it is the remarkable dexterity with which thornton weaves the threads of his story that makes sling blade so powerful . karl's story is heart-breaking because he always is striving to do the right thing , but it is terribly hard for him to get his mind around what that right thing is supposed to be . playing someone with a mental or emotional handicap is one of the most treacherous assignments in acting ( right up there with playing an alcoholic ) , because it is so easy to nail the character's twitches without nailing his soul . the former can be achieved through technical proficiency and a gift for mimicry , with dustin hoffman in rain man and geoffrey rush in shine as a couple of showy recent examples . neither of those roles , however , showed us a character trying to grow as a person , and that is what thornton accomplishes in sling blade . while thornton does turn in an exceptional physical performance , which his polite demeanor and quirky speech patterns , he does not allow karl to be defined by the way he talks . this isn't a character you feel sorry for , like a pet ; this is a man you feel for as a fellow human being . thornton the director draws similar superb performances from his entire cast , particularly dwight yoakam ( yes , _that_ dwight yoakam ) as the cruel doyle . he is casually chilling as he mixes insults and threats with chuckles and expressions of endearment as though incapable of telling the difference , and we can see the pathetic man behind the monster . complexities spill over from sling blade , a film so perfectly crafted and acted from the moment karl leaves the hospital that i wish thornton had reconsidered the first fifteen minutes . it is an awkward conceit which gets sling blade off to an uneven start , but it is just as well thornton demonstrated imperfection as a director . with the kind of flawless work he does as writer and star of sling blade , he might have become positively insufferable if he had directed a perfect film as well . 
2	in stark contrast to the hard-hitting traffic , which is constantly on message , ted demme's blow takes an entertaining , soap opera approach to the world of drug trafficking . not until the end when he is buried in prosthetics does depp look anything other than terrific . as always , his acting is dead-on even if he has trouble looking anything other than great . george confesses that " my ambitions far exceeded my talents , " something that clearly doesn't apply to depp . " it doesn't matter . it seems like it does , but it doesn't . " george , on the other hand , gets a completely different message than the one intended and vows never to be poor again , no matter what it takes . prominently and beautifully featured on the film's poster , pen ? lope cruz ( woman on top ) doesn't show up until well into the second half . cruz is just constitutionally incapable of looking bad . although it is an easy movie to enjoy , it isn't especially challenging or insightful . although it receives only a modest amount of screen time , it is their scenes together that most give humanity to depp's characterization of george and to the movie itself . blow runs a little too long at 2 : 02 . it is rated r for pervasive drug content and language , some violence and sexuality and would be acceptable for high school seniors and older . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
2	in the hands of henry selick , who directed nightmare , this weird story has been transformed into a playful , visually arresting experience with more than a few allusions to the wizard of oz . obviously , the primary reason to see james and the giant peach is for its visual splendor . selick's stop-motion animation is , in its own way , as impressive as the technological marvels of toy story . james' creatures , which include insects , skeletons , birds , and a large-headed boy , are wonderfully exaggerated , but never grotesque . the live-action sequences , which comprise over one-third of the running length , are filmed on intentionally-overstated sets that contribute to a surreal atmosphere not unlike the one visited by jeunet and caro in delicatessan and the city of lost children . only when real actors and animated characters interact does the visual chicanery slip up . of course , all but the youngest children ( who could be frightened by certain scenes ) will be delighted by the film , and , as was true of nightmare , the script is written to succeed on more than one level . there are some deliciously wicked lines that few youngsters will get . this crisp dialogue is delivered by the likes of susan sarandon ( the spider ) , simon callow ( the grasshopper ) , david thewlis ( the earthworm ) , and richard dreyfuss ( the centipede ) , actors with effective vocal presences . unfortunately , the film makers have decided to include several completely forgettable musical numbers penned by randy newman . not only are these totally superfluous , but there are times when they hurt the film's pacing . i'd like to know who made the decision that every disney animated film , no matter who's doing the animation , has to have a share of songs . in the final analysis , james and the giant peach is undemanding entertainment with a subtle message . while the film isn't quite as accomplished as a toy story or a beauty and the beast , it's still worth a trip to the theater , especially for those who enjoy things that are a little unconventional . 
2	evolution , by director ivan reitman ( ghostbusters ) , is a silly sci-fi flick that's a fun blend of your favorites including jurassic park , mars attacks and galaxy quest . although it starts slow , once it gets in gear the laughs start to fly . harry's main concern is about the payout schedule and tax implications of a nobel prize . the science behind the story has equal measure of fascinating imagination and needlessly troublesome logical holes . as the aliens evolve , phil tippett's models are a mixture of the creative and the mundane as if the production were hurried . a typical " monster " is a cute little baby jabba the hutt that turns out to have an alien-like creature in its throat . the film , which is rated pg-13 , will make you jump more than once . don't even think about bringing kids of any age that are easily frightened . the comedy , both physical and verbal , is a real treat , but the actors' ability to pull it off varies widely . jones has great fun chewing up the scenery , and scott never played dumb better . duchovny's performance is uneven , and moore seems miscast . in a picture that pulls no comedic punches , it is one of the few so brazen as to have not only a major product placement but an outright commercial as well . but , never fear , it's all in the service of the comedy and turns out to be quite funny . i'm sure that the placement fees had no influence whatsoever . it is rated pg-13 for crude and sexual humor , and for sci-fi action and would be acceptable for not easily frightened kids 10 and up . my son jeffrey , age 12 , found the film quite funny and gave it * * * 1/2 . his friend sam , also 12 , gave the movie a full * * * * , saying that it was very clever and funny . in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
2	cast : david suchet , lisa harrow , jared harris , larry pine , yeon joo kim director : jonathan nossiter producers : jonathan nossiter , alix madigan , and jed alpert screenplay : james lasdun and jonathan nossiter cinematography : michael barrow and john foster u . s . distributor : cinepix film properties at first glance , there's nothing extraordinary about jonathan nossiter's debut feature , sunday . but , several hours after i had seen the movie , i was still thinking about it , and that's the mark of a film with simple , quiet power . when it premiered at sundance earlier this year , sunday received some of the best press of any picture ( it won both the waldo screenwriting award and the grand jury prize ) ; now , some eight months later , the fledgling distributor cinepix film properties has assured that at least a small nationwide audience will get a chance to see what so many critics found praiseworthy . it's possible to classify sunday as a " love story " , but that would probably be a misnomer . it's about quenching loneliness and finding companionship in a cold , cruel world that has , in its own way , sought to crush both of them . sex is nothing more than a form of primal release , a way to connect with another human being . in a moment of self-deprecating revelation , she claims that the only roles she has a shot at these days are those of zombie mutants in low-budget horror films , adding , " i guess i'm too old to play a human . " ( it's worth noting that nossiter has bucked this trend of using young , attractive actors by casting two out-of-shape , middle-aged performers -- a choice that's crucial to the film's success . ) for the most part , sunday is a poignant , powerfully-realized character study of two lonely people . suchet , who is best known for his role as the title character in pbs's poirot , gained 40 pounds for this part , and plays oliver with great emotional strength . there are times when we can feel ( not just see ) his despair . as wonderfully effective as the quiet scenes are in sunday , nossiter takes his share of missteps . although their purpose -- to strengthen the sense of isolation -- is clear , scenes with these individuals are distracting , taking time away from the interaction between the two leads and interrupting the film's flow . however , the worst these flaws can do is occasionally mute sunday's power . the best moments of the film shine through , leaving behind unforgettable images and feelings that will not evaporate when the house lights go up .

0	a monogram cheapie that holds up fairly well as a low-budget b-film noir , featuring robert mitchum in his first starring role . it's directed by the noted schlock thriller director william castle , who lets the story simply unfold and doesn't embellish it with the gimmicks he was later on to employ in his career of making horror exploitation films . they are still really strangers . evidently he's a better salesman than me . " if you don't expect much , you'll be pleased with many of the graceful film noir touches this low-budget film has and the way it created a chilling nyc atmosphere for the story to be played out . it's a minor film , but it does a good job of providing some thrills and has its moments of pure visual delights : like of hunter staring out her hotel window and her face illuminated by a flashing neon sign as jazz sounds are coming from the street . 
2	the hunchback of notre dame is a carefully constructed show with stunning visuals . the sets are crafted with a wide range from surrealistic crimson cast skies to a skyscraper looking cathedral that is so real that you will feel like you must be wearing 3d glasses . disney takes a lot of risks in adapting this controversial victor hugo novel to the screen . it manages not to offend anyone , even the church which most movies are happy to ridicule ad nauseam . although i like the film and recommend it , i will admit upfront that i was disappointed . based on the hype , i thought it would be much better than last year's pocahontas , but i found them about equal . although the hunchback of notre dame is dramatic , i found only a few scenes moving . the characters are created with a great flourish , but they are not compelling enough to make us care about them more than superficially . remember how concerned you were about bambi and dumbo ? well , disney just does not demonstrate that ability to touch us here . what i missed most of all was the great disney humor . in the lion king , timon and pumbaa are hilarious . the gargoyles , victor ( voice by charles kimbrough ) , hugo ( voice by jason alexander ) and laverne ( voice by mary wickes ) , had the potential to be much funnier , but the lines screenwriters tab murphy and david stainton come up are lame . if you want to see how good a feature length cartoon can be and especially how one can create hilarious characters that are full of pathos then you need look no further back than last year's toy story . it , of course , did not come from the disney studio at all , but rather from a young upstart . okay , okay , so i have expressed my disappointment , but what did you like about the movie other than the look , you ask ? well , that is not a fair question since i want to tell you more about the visual statement this picture makes . i think disney's animation represents the best in american art today . i am sure disney would have monet under contract if he were still alive . let me try to capture some of what i think makes these visuals so outstanding . first , the use of light has all of the realism of a vermeer . the colors are done in a slightly hazy blend of shades of roses and blues . most impressive of all are the transitions from the impressionistic landscape scenes to the imposing scenes of massive buildings that seem to shoot straight out of the canvas , i mean screen . my favorite part of the drawing is that of esmeralda's eyes . although i had expected more , the story does have many good scenes . esmeralda ( voice by demi moore ) is given to making speeches every now and then like " you speak of justice and yet you are cruel to those most in need of justice . " here we are generally saved from the political correctness dogma that was so pervasive in pocahontas . the movie is filled with songs ( alan menken and stephen schwartz ) , but i found all of them instantly forgettable . the film is rated g . there is no nudity , sex , or bad language , and the violence is mild . there are a few scenes like the fire one or the one with a person falling from a building that may scare kids under 4 as may the overall dark tone of the show . my son jeffrey ( age 7 ) who is hypersensitive to violence thinks it would be fine for kids of all ages . i like it too albeit not as much as jeffrey . i recommend it to you and give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : june 26 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	a film review by james berardinelli one thing is certain about clint eastwood : he doesn't play it safe . now , following a romp through more familiar territory in absolute power , eastwood the director is back with this slow , moody adaptation of john berendt's novel , midnight in the garden of good and evil . it's a compelling but meandering tale of lust , murder , sex , voodoo , and betrayal . despite the presence of so many titillating elements , the film's nearly somnambulant pace makes it easy for a viewer to lose his or her concentration . as the title indicates , this film is about the everyday clash of " good " and " evil " in one man's life ( john's life , to be precise ) . it's actually a subtle battle -- nothing is as overwrought as what was presented in devil's advocate -- but it's a war nonetheless . as is often the case , however , all is not as glamorous as it first appears to be , and there's also betrayal and disillusionment to contend with . midnight in the garden would have worked better as a morality play had the " good " aspects of john's struggle been developed more fully than in a series of disjointed , uneven scenes . his love affair with alison , for example , seems almost like an afterthought , when , in fact , it's a critical element of his redemption . on the other hand , this movie would have been more effective as a courtroom drama/detective yarn had it cut out these subplots altogether . they slow down the pace and rob the narrative of tension . in fact , midnight in the garden doesn't have the right running length , regardless of what it's trying to do . it's too short for a dramatic exploration of john's crisis of conscience and too long for a more traditional murder mystery . in many ways , midnight in the garden reminded me of kasi lemmons' eve's bayou . it's not just the superficial similarities -- a southern setting , voodoo , multiple perspectives of the same event , and a sensationalistic murder -- although they are there . however , while i felt that there was a lack of atmosphere in eve's bayou , eastwood does an excellent job of making savannah come alive . more than once , i was thirsty for a mint julep or glass of lemonade . one of the reasons midnight in the garden is a pleasure to watch , despite its lengthy running time , is the strength of the actors' performances . john cusack is perfectly cast as the film's representation of the viewer -- the everyman with a feckless charm . kevin spacey does an exceptional job making jim a charismatic figure who , paradoxically , seems to be both open and secretive . lady chablis , a real-life transvestite , makes the biggest splash ( and will probably get the most press ) with a delightfully comic , over-the-top interpretation of herself . equally outrageous , but accorded less screen time , is irma p . hall's minerva . and australian jack thomspon , sporting an american accent , offers solid support as sonny seiler . it strikes me that the audience for midnight in the garden is likely to be a small , select group , not because the film is bad , but because it demands a certain temperament to enjoy a long , unhurried experience like this . and , while the movie doesn't succeed in effectively developing all of the subplots and secondary themes in its complex tapestry , its main point -- that morality is a relative , not an absolute , quantity -- is presented in a striking fashion . " for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake . " 
1	blade is the picture for those of you who have avoided jackie chan movies because you think he's a wimp . this over-the-top action is , of course , either totally cool or completely ridiculous depending on your point of view . arguably the most fascinating part of the movie is the carefully constructed vampire world that writer david s . goyer lays out for us . in blade the vampire social structure is in the process of being upset by a group of rebellious youngsters of a less than pure strain . snipes , who has a wide acting range from action heroes ( murder at 1600 ) to lovers ( one night stand ) , rarely gets offered the best material . regardless of the quality of script , he manages to put so much energy into it that it is usually worth watching . some actors possess great natural talent , but with snipes it is more his intensity and commitment that make the difference . blade's director , stephen norrington , clearly wants to make a fast-paced , no-holds barred bloodfest , and he succeeds . if vampire pictures are your cup of tea , this is one of the better ones . ( personally , i don't think i'll ever see a better one than habit , which i reviewed earlier this year . ) the problem with norrington's approach is that it soon becomes highly repetitive . a half-hour would probably suffice for most viewers , and some will be so grossed out by french kissing vampires with blood drenched mouths that they will leave before the film is over anyway . even if the guns are sleek and powerful , blade's noisy , old black dodge charger provides as much visceral thrill as its aging mufflers growl . the movie leaves you with a reason not to throw out that old cancer-inducing sunlamp you have in the back of the closet . blade runs 2 : 00 . it is rated r for strong violence and vampire related gore and would be fine for most teenagers . 
1	that's probably okay since the men who answer the ad aren't what they claim to be either . director and editor brad anderson makes the ad the centerpiece of his breezy , little romantic comedy . heavy on the melancholy , the tale has a pervasive score full of dreamy , sad rhythms . davis gives such a reserved performance that the audience doesn't know much more about erin when the story ends than when it began . erin's most visible trait is her reluctance to smile , and the film's biggest mystery is who will make her smile and when . like davis , gelfant doesn't reveal much with his acting . with the fish out of the way , the bad guys hope the aquarium will become so unpopular it will not want to expand . this whole subplot borders on the ridiculous and isn't particularly funny . in easily the best part of the film , erin chooses to call back the 60+ men who responded to the ad . like a sequence from a woody allen movie , we see a whole series of " suitors " telling erin lies calculated to win her heart or at least get her into bed . most guys try trite come-on lines with " you're the most beguiling woman i've ever met " being typical . most men are so full of themselves that they sound like they might burst at any moment . " i see . i want . i take . " this extended comedy sketch of her interviews and trial dates works marvelously well , but it is not enough to sustain an entire movie . the rest of the picture marks time until the sappy ending , which the story telegraphs in advance . uta briesewitz's handheld camera work is dizzying and confusing . coupled with anderson's fast paced and erratic editing , the movie becomes disorienting . jokes like the answering machine that keeps repeating " you have no messages " lose their punch in the frenzy of the hyperactive editing . with several good laughs and an undeniable charm , the picture can be quite entertaining . with fewer attempts at cuteness with the camera and the editing and with the elimination of some of the subplots , the movie could have really blossomed . as delivered , however , it has a hilarious comedy sketch in the middle but little more . it is rated r for profanity and sexual situations and would be fine for teenagers . 
2	even if the formulaic plot suffers from a certain amount of predictability , the movie has a superb cast who keep the tension up throughout . into this soap opera of a story come a murder and a mystery . the script carefully gives annie less than laser sharp powers . as she trembles with palpable fear , she witnesses frightening events but frequently sees only small parts of a much larger episode . collecting the entire picture , however , is frequently difficult or impossible for her . blanchett's acting alone is enough to recommend the movie . her power itself appears to be more burden than blessing . bringing up the natural background sounds sometimes and using melancholic instrumental country music at others , raimi gives his movie a realism that transcends the story's more sensational elements . i find that any movie , as this one does , that features a trial is usually a cinematic gift . i'd trade a dozen teen comedies for one exceptional trial . i rate the trial in the gift worth only two or three teen comedies . still , a trial is a trial , and i'm happy to be able to enjoy it . it is rated r for violence , language , sexuality and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
0	it was hard to believe how bad this sophomoric spoof on catholicism is , but seeing is believing . kevin smith ( clerks/mallrats/chasing amy ) has shown what it takes to make a satire that isn't funny and one that doesn't have enough bite in it to be subversive ( it is not shocking to know that the director is a practising catholic ) . this one is a yawner , one in which i found it difficult to sit through , as its two hours of belabored effort and uninspired acting seemed longer than that ; and , it was all in the name of getting beat over the head with the director's inane indulgent musings on religion , as he tries to gross the audience out with foul language , sight gags of unpleasant sights , such as a pile of shit emerging from a toilet bowl , and an irrelevant premise for an argument against catholicism , an argument that is about as crude a one as i have heard in some time . it is also a film that left me disgusted not only because of its banal argument against catholicism , but because it was a wise-guy film , shot with a sneer , by someone without the temperament and intellectual stability to make such a metaphysical film . the filmmaker is way over his head in this attempt to combine serious argument with one of silliness , spending most of his time lecturing and moralizing the audience with his half-baked knowledge of theology and then resorting to shock techniques to get across his laborious point of view , as if it is a startling revelation he was revealing , that there is politics in the catholic church . the film's original distributor , miramax , ran into trouble with the catholic league who complained about the film's sacrilegious content and therefore forced it to be distributed by a smaller studio , lion's gate . the protestors were right about one thing , the film is offensive . but they are wasting their time protesting , this movie shouldn't be banned ( i don't want to see films banned ) . this film's only crime is that it is a revolting film and there is no reason to make it a martyr , we have enough martyrs in the world already . take my word for it , seeing god in this film is anticlimactic . that carlin , a natural comedian , is not funny in this role , a role that is ready-made for comedy , indicates how poorly things are going for smith . the premise of " dogma , " is that glick's church re-dedication will allow the banished angels to re-enter heaven , thus proving god fallible and , thereby , negating all existence . fiorentino and rickman are flat and unconvincing in their roles , getting neither comedy nor drama out of their performance , just giving me a mild headache listening to them deliver their vacuous lines . catholic dogma declares god's word to be unquestioned and to be a good catholic one has to accept the dogma without questioning it . the problem with these revelations , is that they are not exactly fresh news and they seemed to be delivered in such a jarring manner , as if the actors were puppets just mouthing words that seemed out of place . there was just no flow in this film , just long periods of schlock comedy and boredom and endless talking . to take this film seriously is a big mistake , which is why i have no sympathy for protestors of this film . if you got some laughs out of this mishmash , then you got more than i did from it . i just felt relieved that i sat through it and didn't walk out . smith appears to be a very limited director , he can't shoot action scenes , and his film was childish and unfocused . it was one of the most disappointing films i have seen , so far , in 1999 , especially noting how it got some favorable comments when shown in film festivals in america and abroad . what is particularly disturbing for me , is that his religious message isn't wrong -faith should not be a burden but a blessing , and his view on the corporate heads who finance films , who worship only money , is not something that i entirely disagree with , i just don't see him as the one delivering this message . 
2	the action takes place offscreen . some viwers might consider niagara more of a steamy melodrama than a noir , but it does have all the dark ingredients fitting a noir film , whereby an innocent is overtaken by a lust that consumes him , while the femme fatale is a heartless schemer with a large sexual appetite . this was marilyn monroe's first starring role , after having been in already eighteen other films , but mostly in small roles . director hathaway does a nice job of crafting the film and exploiting its colorful location , but what he doesn't do that well , is allow the mystery part of the story to gracefully unfold . the last reel plays like an action film , with a strangulation , a kidnapping , a helicopter rescue , and one character doomed to be going over the falls . in contrast to the loomis' , the cutler's are seen as being a conventional couple , and the camera seems to be gently eyeballing them and showing that their sex life is calmer and more suited for a positive and loving relationship than the loomis' . yet the normal couple is attracted to the more exotic one , especially polly , through whose eyes the film is filtered out to us . 
2	cast : catherine deneuve , daniel auteuil , laurence cote , fabienne babe , didier bezace , julien riviere director : andre techine producer : alain sarde screenplay : michel alexandre , pascal bonitzer , gilles taurand , andre techine cinematography : jeanne lapoirie music : philippe sarde u . s . distributor : sony pictures classics in fact , techine drew so much interest for his installment of the french tv series , all the boys and girls of the world , that filmopolis pictures rushed out and acquired the distribution rights to techine's previous film , ma saison preferee . now , the acclaimed director whose movies were once rarely seen beyond new york's walter reade theater is reaching increasingly larger and more enthusiastic audiences . emphasis , however , on slight . the film features riveting performances by french icons catherine deneuve and daniel auteuil as two points of a romantic triangle . the third component is essayed by the sexy laurence cote , who , despite ten years of french screen credits , is a virtual newcomer to u . s . viewers . the acting , a hallmark of techine's films , has never been stronger than in thieves . auteuil , who does this kind of role so well ( check out un couer en hiver for an example ) , is perfectly cast , and never for the briefest of moments does his portrayal ring false . on the other hand , although cote gives a strong performance , her character , juliette , is more of a catalyst than a three-dimensional individual . juliette's presence remains enigmatic and sketchily drawn , and is all-but-forgotten during the movie's final third . the middle section of the film is somewhat murky , and , with auteuil and deneuve largely off-screen , less compelling . taking nothing away from cote's performance , she doesn't hold our attention the way her co-stars do , in part because her character doesn't exhibit the same emotional depth or breadth . this segment of the movie also features the most exposition , introducing us to the inner workings of the thieves' ring . this isn't love , at least not in the conventional sense , but something that is , paradoxically , less profound and more complex . ultimately , the film's anchor is alex , whose highest hope for life is not to feel pain , who never laughs and sees evil everywhere , and whose personality alters with brilliant-but-unmistakable subtlety . techine's development of alex and marie is masterful ; auteuil and deneuve keep our attention riveted to the screen whenever they're on . and , while the director doesn't succeed in plumbing the emotional depths reached by ma saison preferee , there are elements of thieves that touch us nearly as forcefully -- those moments just aren't as plentiful . so , although thieves is strong and keenly-insightful , it is the least imposing of techine's trio of u . s . releases . 
0	michael made his debut in john carpenter's 1978 horror classic , halloween , possibly the best scare movie to come along in the last twenty-five years . it set a standard that nothing since has come close to equaling--not five halloween sequels or numerous rip-offs . now , with the release of the sixth ( and hopefully final ) movie to bear the halloween moniker , we see how far the mighty have fallen . therefore , since the bloodline continues , michael's work isn't done . never has the halloween series appeared worse than in its latest incarnation . this one makes installment five look like a veritable masterpiece . just goes to show that if they keep making these kinds of films , they'll find ways to screw things up even more . there's no sense of danger--michael is stalking characters we don't care about . haddonfield has turned into a town without a personality or soul , and even michael doesn't seem the least bit menacing . even the unmistakable theme music sounds tinny and hollow , and is mixed with the generic strains of something credited to alan howarth . needless to say , the gore level is high and the scare level low--although not as low as the intelligence level . half the time , i didn't understand what was going on . the other half , i didn't care . i tried to keep a body count ( making tick marks on my notepad gave me something to do ) , but i lost track during the climactic massacre . i guess the total must have been somewhere around twenty , but it's difficult to be sure . by now , you'd think haddonfield would be prepared for this sort of thing whenever dr . loomis shows up muttering about " pure evil " and michael " coming home . " heck , if i lived there and saw loomis coming , i'd get out of town . perhaps the saddest thing about this halloween is the dedication at the end : " for donald pleasence . " what a tragic epitaph for the once-great british actor that this tripe should represent his last on-screen appearance--even if it is true that over the past seventeen years , pleasence and halloween have become synonymous . the release date of the film is odd--one would have expected a halloween sequel to open a little closer to october 31 ( actually , it was originally scheduled for october 13 , but the competition was deemed too stiff ) . as it is , this movie will no longer be around by the time halloween arrives , the marketplace for slasher movies having dwindled dramatically . in the final analysis , the curse of michael myers is a horrific motion picture--just not in the way the film makers intended . 
2	director sean penn and actor jack nicholson , who last collaborated in the over-the-top the crossing guard , surprise us this time with the pledge , a picture of remarkable grace and subtlety . the pledge focuses almost exclusively on jack nicholson as detective jerry black , although many fine actors show up to turn in nice cameos and supporting parts . or is he just lying in wait ? or is it both ? what is most unusual about the second half is that the script by jerzy kromolowski and mary olson-kromolowski , based on friedrich d ? rrenmatt's book , telegraphs where it is going yet maintains the tension . and , when the story finally gets to the easily guessed destination , the film avoids the most committed sin by screenwriters everywhere -- the obsession with tying up all the loose ends . this , of course , may drive anal-retentive viewers nuts , but it does provide for great post-theater car conversations . still , what you will remember a week later isn't the ending . it will be nicholson's exceptional and atypically reserved performance . his detective doesn't come from some overwrought method acting . his worries are made palpable through an intense but delicately nuanced performance by nicholson . it may not be his very best performance , but it sure is a treat to observe . it is rated r for strong violence and language and would be acceptable for older teenagers . in the silicon valley it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . 
0	cricket . that's what they call lloyd in hector barron's the ugly kid . mrs . crub , the worst of the bunch , ridicules her pupils by saying things like , " you're here to learn . ignorance isn't something to be proud of ! " she is of the opinion that the kids would learn more if the school weren't so much fun . most of the acting , especially by the adults , is way below the level found in just about any television series on the disney channel . bosley tries hard to be sympathetically obnoxious but ends up being just obnoxious instead . our family was wishing that lloyd would make the whole movie disappear . and the sooner the better . it is rated pg for language and playground violence and would be acceptable for most kids . my son jeffrey , almost 12 , who is a 6th grader just like lloyd , thought the movie was absolutely terrible . he said that the acting and the plot were dull , boring and stupid and that there weren't any funny or exciting parts anywhere in the picture . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
2	" i think cher said that . " sugar town by joint writers and directors allison anders and kurt voss is a bitingly sardonic tale about fame and the lack thereof . like a mixture of the player and short cuts , the satire successfully includes over a dozen leads and yet manages to develop all of them into interesting individuals in their own right . a thoroughly enjoyable movie , it is full of laughs , small and large . still , it is work . needless to say , he will prove less than organic . the quirky comedy , full of biting sarcasm , is also educational . " it's all about the microphone , " bert explains . it is rated r for strong language , some drug content and sexuality and would be fine for teenagers . 
1	although one cannot be sure what angels look like , nicolas cage , dressed from head to toe in somber shades of black , makes a most impressive one . and unlike john travolta's jocular version , cage's has all the seriousness of an undertaker . with a tremendous sense of the visual but without much storytelling ability , director brad silberling attempts a remake of wim wenders's german film wings of desire . although wenders's film is only ten years , it is already being referred to as a classic . why silberling , whose only other film was the mediocre casper , thought this was the right time and he was the right person to redo so recent a movie remains unclear . with his long black coat and constant five-o'clock shadow , cage , using small variations on his basic melancholic expression , rethinks the whole concept of the angelic . they can be seen by mortals only if they want to be , which they rarely do . the picture is at its most magical during the eventual first touch and first kiss sequences . think way back to the excitement and rapture of the first time that you ever held a lover's hand and of your first romantic kiss . rising above even these experiences , the scenes exist on a higher plane that may make goose pimples crawl up and down your arms . the film works best when it reduces the story to a tableau . the tall , darkly dressed angles , dotting the beach for their morning music by gabriel yared , provide the impact that the script by dana stevens rarely delivers . ( wim wenders is also listed on the writing credits since he did the screenplay for the original movie . ) the audience at our screening was squirming in their seats since the movie seemed as though it was going on for an eternity . as good as some of the visuals are , they are highly repetitive and done excruciatingly slowly . " some things are true whether you believe in them or not , " he explains with his usual gravity . the chemistry between them lacks the emotional punch that the story requires . nathan has a secret that drives the second half of the film . franz steals most of his scenes with an energy sadly lacking in the rest of the movie . the monotonic and glacially paced story eventually comes to its completely predictable and highly manipulative ending . the city of angels could easily be remade as a short film with music but no words . now that's a remake worth seeing . it is rated pg-13 for sexuality and brief male nudity and would be fine for kids around ten and up . 
1	the film was powerful enough in its political jibes to have made the state and the church and the opposition party condemn it . though this is not the director's top-of-the line artistic work , it does fit positively into his opus . it seemed awkward and out of place in this straight forward film , whose darkened cameras captured enough of the sobering mood of poland for the story to be a compelling one , a story about the unfinished business of the struggle for freedom . 
1	everyone in the show knows that they have signed up to do a farce so they milk the slapstick as hard they can . depending on your point of view , this film is either truly awful or so bad it is good . in either case , be warned that a little of this repetitive movie can go a long way . the best actor in the show is never seen . and when george gets shot point blank in the head , the narrator reasons with us , " george can't die because he's the star . " after the narrator , the next best parts of the film are the few special effects . most of us never seen a full grown elephant that jumps around and has all the mannerisms of a dog . george has just such a hybrid , and the elephant is the largest and most unusual version of man's best friend you are ever likely to see . imagine an elephant playing fetch . but don't leave yet . there's a funny epilogue set in las vegas . and then it does end , well sort of . the film's theme song is guaranteed to remain firmly planted in your brain for months . you'll be singing it at the office , driving your coworkers crazy . aargh , i'm doing it again . ) george of the jungle runs 1 : 32 , which is longer than it sounds . the movie is rated pg , but consider it a g and fine for kids of any age . my son jeffrey , age 8 , thought it was " great !

1	shot almost entirely on digital video with a hand-held camera , miguel arteta's ( star maps ) chuck and buck is an arresting homo-erotic tale about the pangs of growing up while still stuck emotionally at an adolescent stage . these scenes are the heart of the film , as they bring out whatever brilliance there is to be found in the characterizerations , depicting in an honest way how those who are not destined to live a conventional life behave with each other in a natural setting . the film allowed the supporting characters to interact with each other , not going for the cheap comedy it could have gone after by just making fun of buck's tortured character . this makes the supporting characters not that much different than buck as to their feelings of insecurity . a gnawing flaw to this film is that it hits a dead spot , which comes after the play is presented . the thinly disguised autobiographical play , embarrasses chuck . the film seemed to run out of steam at that point , having exhausted itself of its underlying probe into the tormented soul of buck , who is seen more as a pathetic figure who is desperately in need of being touched , someone who does not possess the social skills to relate with others . the film takes a few deep breathes and returns for a discerning conclusion , which was thoroughly credible and well-presented . a tremendous effort by the indie film-makers is realized to tell a moving character study , thereby achieving such a high-quality film on such a low-budget , as it daringly rests its unsentimental case on such a thin plot and succeeds because its characterizations came to life and the effort to look at friendship and human behavior was an honest one . it is also a disarmingly funny movie . 
0	the provocative title tells it all , a pretentious satire on the negro myth of him being a stud to white ladies . the film is adapted from the novel by haitian author dany laferri ? re . the thin story never moves far away from its sophomoric attempt to shock and irritate a white male audience about its simplistic findings , but something that is certainly thought of in a very real way and taken to be a serious generalization by western society . to accomplish this parody , everyone in the film becomes a clich ? figure , with the main stud taking on every positive sexual myth of his prowess that he could about how good in bed the negro is . it seems this film will have you believe that every white girl in the film is dying to try out this sex god for themselves , and with the stud evoking what goes for a cool attitude , too willing to please one and all , the film becomes ridiculous in its banality without getting to how racist its theme is . the film by reducing everyone to being what their color of skin is , as it fails to get at truths that are more than skin-deep . this is film that fell in love with its generalizations and can't go further than that , even failing to draw comic relief from its stupid characterizations or making the protagonist anything but obnoxious and terribly vain . if the main character in a spicy spoof like this one , can't be likable , then the film has no chance of succeeding . it was a difficult film to just see this as a playful venture , which it should have been , but what made matters worse , was that it took itself seriously and tried to make a forced case about racial prejudice , using absurd scenes to try and show how white men feel inferior to the negro when it comes to sex and therefore will do anything to get back at the negro . i assume this film was trying to be funny , but its story was so full of generalizations that it was not possible to get by that and see people as they really are and not as stereotypes . this film probably does more harm to racial relations than it does good . it is a film that the kkk could easily agree with its findings , failing to see that the film was meant to be tongue-in-cheek . and that's the problem with the film , the satire had no power , as the film seemed more real than ironic . jacques w . beno ? t's french-canadian film is a dehumanizing experience , a film of missed opportunities to explore interracial realtionships , it is so dehumanizing that it doesn't even give the girls real names the stud has sex with , they are just given names like miz literature , miz tickle-tickle , miz redhead , and so on . outside of his sex , it is hard to find anything he does that is even remotelty interesting . that he wishes to be a writer and succeeds at it by the film's finale , typing as if he were banging on a drum , was hard to swallow . the only thing that was credible about the stud , was the enormous ego he had , it must have been as big as his . . . well , you know what i mean . 
0	so bitter is the weather that even the surface of the sea freezes solid . with more engaging material , this approach could have worked , but the remote and uninvolving script makes less for a movie than a cinematic tone poem . rickman and sharman macdonald created the script from macdonald's play , which was hopefully better than the motion picture adaptation . " i can do what i like . i can gain weight if i like , and i can cut my own hair . " ) both law and thompson appear to be following directions carefully in their acting , but neither character is well developed or worth caring about . michael kamen's hauntingly sad piano music and seamus mcgarvey's chillingly handsome cinematography fill the screen with beauty , but the movie itself is as cold as the frozen climate . the movie is so soporific that one begins to hope against hope that some misfortune will strike one of the players to stir up some genuine conflicts and emotions . instead , all we get is contrived and meaningless banter and inconsequential actions . if the dialog is deep and worth pondering , then saying little and doing less can succeed , but this story bogs down in petty disagreements . when a show works , it is easy to forgive major mistakes in its staging , but this dreadfully dull tale had me noticing them everywhere . consider just one aspect . the story goes to great lengths to remind the audience how cold it is -- the temperature being the film's chief metaphor . why then are there so many incongruities ? " i don't where i was , " chloe remarks at one point in the movie . " i don't know who i am yet . " with the actors' scenes edited out , we would be left with a lovely fifteen minute music video . that part is all that is worth seeing . it is rated r for brief nudity and a little profanity . the picture would be fine for teenagers . 
2	the film's theme is about how women are made to suffer in iran because of its harsh islamic laws against them , which makes all of their lives placed in the same never ending circle of repression . which is why the film has no main protagonist ; the cast , except for fereshteh sadr orafai and fatemeh naghavi , are all nonprofessionals . jafar panahi ( white balloon/the mirror ) , a disciple of abbas kiarostami , has created a devastatingly restrained powerhouse of a political film . a winner of the golden lion at the venice film festival , even though it has been banned in iran except for a one-time screening to a small student audience . a woman's life is shown to be not as worthy as a man's in modern iran , as the story of one woman is carried on as the story of another woman's . the enemy obviously isn't the iranian people , but an intolerant government that cannot bend and forces its stupid rules down a subjected peoples' throats . this film conveys these dark feelings through a story without much of a plot or dialogue , yet brilliantly establishes the yearnings for freedom that these women have . it's much like those warner brother films of the 1930s with jimmy cagney thumbing his nose at the high brows . panafi has taken us into the psyche of the oppressive regime and without saying what's right or wrong , allows us instead to see for ourselves the everyday street life of modern iran . it's a country far from freedom , yet its filmmakers can still make a film that is unpredictable and forthright . this is something that's rarely accomplished in uncensored hollywood whose commercial ventures are mostly formulaic crowd pleaser films . these are amazing restrictions placed on them and ones that panafi allows us to see in an exciting and unforgettable way . it's a moody , realistic tale about iran that the news media can't seem to cover with a reasonable verisimilitude as well as this very daring effort does . it succeeds in showing us as much as one can in today's iran about its long laundry list of injustices . this is one film that cannot easily be forgotten , even as we lose sight of the different women we have seen . all the performances were natural and easily fit into the story . the facial expressions of both orfani and mamizade caught my attention : orfani's had that caring , intense look of the italian actress anna magnani ; while mamizade's expression changed from curiosity to vulnerability . 
2	as they sit properly on her shag-carpeted floor , they enjoy some " negro music , " something ben has heard little of . but liberty heights isn't some heavy romantic tragedy a la " romeo and juliet . " instead , it's another light-hearted comedy from writer and director barry levinson . sure , it's about discrimination in everything from swimming pools ( " no jews , dogs or coloreds allowed " ) to the numbers racket , but any movie in which a jew dresses up as adolf hitler for halloween doesn't expect to be taken too seriously . the characters are likable , but their development keeps coming up short . when levinson finally introduces some creative tension in the story's last act , it feels contrived and awkward . nevertheless , the movie on the whole proves more attractive than the sum of its parts . levinson divides the world along sharp racial lines in his story with the jews referring to the gentiles as " the other kind . " overcome with all of this whiteness , he can't eat . most of the film's jokes don't amount to much with ones about the size of male private parts being prominent . " life is made of a few big moments and a lot of little ones , " ben explains in voice-over . levinson's movies like diner , tin men and avalon celebrate the little ones . and liberty heights is an attractive , albeit modest , addition to the levinson collection . an innocent picture that is on the mild side of most pg-13 movies , it would be fine for kids around 12 and up . 
2	cast : nicolas cage , meg ryan , denis franz , andre braugher , colm feore director : brad silberling producers : dawn steel , charles roven screenplay : dana stevens based on wings of desire cinematography : john seale music : gabriel yared u . s . distributor : warner brothers suddenly , it's hip to believe in god ( not necessarily a specific god -- an amorphous , non-denominational deity will do ) , an afterlife , and , of course , angels . the entertainment industry , never one to be left out on any trend , has thrown itself headlong into this one . on tv , the cloying " touched by an angel " is a hit -- a mainstay of many people's sunday night viewing plans . and the movies have jumped on the bandwagon , too , giving us enough celestial beings in the last few years to crowd the head of a pin -- michael , the preacher's wife , wide awake , and now city of angels . add films that feature satan and his minions ( like devil's advocate and fallen ) or less well-defined issues of mortality ( i . e . , contact and the sweet hereafter ) , and this list of titles explodes . most american-made motion pictures based on foreign originals tend to be huge disappointments . i could probably name 15 or 20 examples , but i'll confine myself to two obvious ones : the vanishing and diabolique , both of which were so bad that they were insulting . the birdcage was an enjoyable americanization of la cage aux folles . sommersby did some interesting things with the return of martin guerre . and now city of angels has effectively re-worked ( rather than re-made ) wim wenders' 1988 art-house classic , wings of desire , by taking away some of the earlier film's more meditative elements and deepening the romantic aspect . the ending is completely , and surprisingly , different . dressed like heaven's men in black , the angels are an odd bunch . they cannot touch , taste , or smell . but , unlike most of his brethren , he has a strong desire to experience what it's like to be human . he seems to share the sentiment of a comment that he relates to fellow angel cassiel ( andre braugher ) : " what good would wings be if you couldn't feel the wind on your face ? " when it comes to heavenly matters , city of angels doesn't offer any particular insights . the movie does not ponder the meaning of life ; rather , it shamelessly celebrates the human experience by demonstrating the monotony of endless voyeurism . on a somewhat less-intellectual level , it's also about sacrifice . but the film doesn't thrive on ideas alone ( if it tried , it would be in trouble , since it's not that deep ) . solid acting and positive chemistry are critical to city of angels' success . nicolas cage is fine as seth , although there are times when he doesn't quite fit into the angel's shoes . cage is good as the detached observer , watching and waiting , but there's a quality of childlike innocence to seth that he doesn't quite pull off . there's a scene in city of angels that is pretty much lifted from it's a wonderful life , and it illustrates how much more convincing james stewart was . meg ryan , as always , is delightful and ebullient as maggie . this is a case of perfect casting -- i can only think of a few other actresses who are as good as ryan in this kind of role . her range -- despair and hope , pain and rapture -- places her work in city of angels alongside that in prelude to a kiss and courage under fire as proof that she is a capable , well-rounded dramatic talent . meanwhile , in a supporting role ( the one essayed by peter falk in wings of desire and its sequel , faraway so close ) , scene-stealing denis franz is delightful as the king of hedonism . i suspect city of angels is going to remind many viewers of ghost , but there's a big difference : this film is more true and less manipulative . ( in tone , although not necessarily in content , it reminded me of truly madly deeply . ) ultimately , it is a tear-jerker , but there's more to it than that . while the movie isn't as effective as wings of desire in developing the angels' culture and presenting a meditation upon spirituality , it gives us a pair of well-developed protagonists worth caring about and establishes a complex dynamic between them . city of angels is more romantic than profound , but dana stevens' script is thoughtful and intelligent , and i never felt insulted by what the characters say , do , or think . director brad silberling , who previously made another supernatural tale , the live-action casper , effectively suggests the spiritual/material duality of the world . it's a subdued motion picture , but the lack of overt melodrama makes for a moving and involving story . even for those enraptured by wings of desire , city of angels is strong enough to cast its own quietly romantic spell . " my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . " -- david puttnam 
0	i am sorry to report that tim burton has decided to make a third batman movie , batman forever . this is the first one that he did not direct although he did produce it . for director he tapped joel schumacher , whose only halfway decent film was the client . this time we have chris o'donnell playing dick grayson - robin . the plot , you ask ? why do you ask ? if you have seen one batman , you have seen them all . i will not cover the plot as its existence is irrelevant . one sees batman to sneer at the villains and watch all of the gadgetry and stunts . almost every scene requires the suspension of disbelief in order to watch it . the script is full of one liners that end in " ha ha ha " just to make sure that you know it is supposed to be a joke . moreover , the director has the actors get all wild eyed to make absolutely sure you know it is a joke . perhaps , batman has always been this way , but the style has outlined ability to charm or interest an audience . the audience in the theater i was at had about as much interest in the movie as val kilmer did , which is almost none . he sleepwalked through most of the movie . even at that , his performance was much better than kidman's who was unable to demonstrate she could act at all , and based on her previous movies , i would say the jury is still out on that question anyway . the sets by barbara ling and the cinematography by stephen goldblatt were in the usual dark and foreboding batman style . granted they were not as sinister as in batman or batman returns , nevertheless , they were pretty depressing . i understand that robin williams was offered the role of the riddler , but tim burton got frustrated when williams would not make up his mind if he wanted to take the part or not and gave it to carrey instead out of frustration . frankly , i think williams's style of humor would have enlivened the show some , and i am sorry he did not agree to do the part . batman forever seemed liked it ran forever . the editing by dennis virkler was fast paced , but had too much material at 2 : 00 . i was bored from the beginning . it is correctly rated pg-13 for comic violence and sexual references . i would not let kids under 13 see it , but there were a fair number of 8 year olds and above in the audience when i saw it . i do not recommend the movie , and i award it a single star solely for the gadgets . i hope tim burton realizes that the batman formula is tired , and it is time to bury it . i do hope that next year we do not have batman ad nauseam as yet another blockbuster attempt . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	( this makes impersonating him unusually easy -- one fake breast , and voila ) . the gun itself is a beautiful piece of weaponry that can be assembled on the spot from its slick , smoothly rounded pieces . moore , clearly comfortable with his part this time , executes with precision albeit not with connery's flair and charisma . still , moore is believable this time as bond , something george lazenby never was . the film , especially in its nighttime sequences , handsomely photographed by ted moore and oswald morris , continues the bond tradition of taking us to beautiful and exotic foreign locals . ah , the bond women . the bond films progressively push the limits of almost displaying nudity without ever showing it clearly . but the bond films prize their family-friendly ratings so technically we don't exactly see her . as bond says to scaramanga , " we all get our jollies one way or another . " bond films titillate , but only within carefully controlled bounds . britt ekland plays mary goodnight , bond's lovely , brave , but sometimes not too bright fellow agent . in the case of ekland , there are other reasons why a bikini uniform is a particularly desirable clothing choice . i could do without bond's image as he smokes foot long cigars . and maybe there are those who still think so today an ugly american , he spews racial epithets at the local chinese that will have you wanting to cover your ears in shame . the nicest thing he is says is that they could get to work faster if they'd get out of those silly pajamas . one hopes that this character will not appear again . in contrast to the poorly choreographed fight sequences in many of the earlier bond films , this one has a perfectly executed and quite funny one set at the villain's martial arts school . the film's obligatory car chase cum demolition derby is a carbon copy of a hundred other pictures . only the great bond theme music makes it anything special . the previous film , live and let die , for example , had the same chase , better executed . two of the story's shoot-outs occur in a funhouse-style shooting gallery that looks like they were lifted straight out of an episode of the television series , " the avengers . " but given that they borrowed the idea , it's good to see that they stole from the best . this time it's the other side that has the best gadget -- a wing with a jet engine that can be attached to a car to turn it into an airplane . nothing less than a monopoly on solar energy , which we are told will upset the world's oil sheiks . most of the story however is a simple series of chase scenes . we learn almost nothing about the grand strategy until the last twenty minutes of the picture so that it feels almost tacked on . the result is an entertaining film but not a very substantial one . it is rated pg for sexual innuendo and violence and would be fine for kids around nine and up . my son jeffrey , almost 9 , said it was an okay movie and better than the previous one with roger moore . 
0	what can you say about this set in baltimore film , by the king of bad taste , john waters , except it is what can be expected from the director whose type of rebellious childish low-budget indie films have now become passe since his peak days of the 1970s , when he made " pink flamingos . " now his satire has become more tame than outrageous . it is ironic that the director made a film railing about the poor quality of a hollywood film and has made a film that is equally as bad , if not worst . this is a shoddy production , the comedy is lame , the acting almost non-existent , and the satire is sophomoric , taking pop shots at an easy target such as hollywood , but shots that have no sting . if i laughed more , then i could have found some justification for the film . at best , this " demented " could be seen as a tv sketch on " saturday night live , " or a straight to video movie release . as a full-length feature , it ran out of gas shortly after the initial kidnapping scene and went quickly downhill due to a lack of subtlety and the film's inability to be challenging or get at what is really troubling about pop culture . it certainly can't be because the theaters still make popcorn in cocoanut oil and people who go to theaters in the mall talk during the film . demented rants that he is quite willing to die for art and will do anything to make his film . -- to her enthusiasm about changing her image and acting in their film , made for some of the most amusing scenes in the film . the kidnapping scene had some energy in it before even that became tiresome . there was some gentle digs at hollywood : from poking fun at a pauly shore film marathon to the mall showing only " star wars " and " star trek " films to the set of the expensive remake of " forrest gump " being taken over by the guerillas to `les enfants du paradis' panned for being insultingly dubbed in english to mocking the maryland film commission to the " patch adams " film showing of a director's cut in the mall . these were easy targets and the comedy wasn't that funny or radical . it might have been funny on paper but when acted out , it seemed to be mild stuff , things even mainstream films do in a more daring way these days . everyone in the film is bursting at the seams thinking about sex , but cecil has outlawed sex until the movie is completed , so they all live by being sexually frustrated and some are even confused about what kind of sexuality fits them . there's not much to prove by the kidnapping , as the story is really irrelevant . the thing here is if the character can shock you and if the film hit your funny bone . for me , it came up close to empty in all respects . i'll take my deranged films from andy warhol anytime , whose freaks are really freaky and whose stories have more of an edge to them . here , dorff is good enough as the abby hoffman characterization of a punk who has gone completely mental as a deranged artist , while griffith is a good sport , taking in all the remarks about honey's age , her ego-centredness , her tantrums , her phony public demeanor and her defense of the kind of film she made a reputation on as a hollywood star , first defending and then renouncing it . but i wouldn't call her performance acting , as she was mainly around to play a prop of herself to be used as a source for the comedy . the satire was not tough enough to make this a biting film , but rather one that has no claws to scratch and no gumption to really antagonize anyone but the christian right-wing moralists . and since it can still at least do that , no matter how trivial this film is , i guess , the film has a little fire in its belly . . . by the way , water's stated in an interview that the film got its title " cecil b . demented , " because that's what he was called in an early review . 
1	if you ever find yourself in a simulated world , don't tell the natives . it can be very upsetting to learn that your flesh and blood is just a stream of bits on someone's computer . opening with the " i think , therefore i am " quote of descartes , josef rusnak's the thirteenth floor serves notice that this is a pretentious movie . indeed , the script by josef rusnak and ravel centeno-rodriguez , based on daniel f . galouye's novel " simulacron 3 , " does a masterful job of setting up a plot with an intriguing premise . with shades of the truman show and the matrix , the movie takes so much risk that it is a shame that about its only memorable parts are the cinematography and the set decoration . colored in hazy sepia tones , this attractive world features showgirls that dance the night away to big bands . since hammond fuller had no known relatives , this confuses everyone . the film's coldly antiseptic present matches all too perfectly the style of the acting . none of the characters has any warmth or genuineness . the screenplay has so many logical holes and out-of-left-field events that you're liable to end up snickering at it , as our audience did . and suspension of disbelief is a prerequisite . if you're a grownup and have never been out of town , take this as a sign that something may not be quite right in your world . still , for all of its flaws , the story possesses a strange fascination , and you're unlikely to be bored . " you can't just plug your brain into this machine and not be affected by it , " jane says . watching this movie is like that . it becomes more intriguing that it has any right to be , given its limitations . if you want a good science fiction film , then this frustrating one may not be the one for you . on the other hand , if it's a good-looking science fiction film you're after , then look no further . the thirteenth floor is exquisite eye-candy for the sci-fi set . it is rated r for violence and some profanity and would be fine for teenagers . 
0	screenplay : jeb stuart and philip morton . director : felix enriquez alcala . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 98 minutes . in an uncertain world , there's something strangely reassuring about the films of steven seagal . the economy may rise and fall , but seagal will always dispatch all adversaries with the same vaguely bored smirk and without a hair in his ponytail drifting out of place . you can't depend on political institutions , but you can depend on the fact that seagal will put together a wardrobe where nary a pastel nor a t-shirt will be found . all else changes , but seagal stays the same -- the same facial expression , the same tone of voice for every emotion , the same humorless self-importance . he is stasis personified . there's not much new to say about fire down below , because there's not much new to see . and none of those bones ever belong to seagal's character . a seagal fight sequence is uniquely monotonous not just because the hero always wins -- action heroes usually win -- but because no one ever lays a finger on him . i doubt seagal will ever make a truly thrilling action thriller ( and yes , that includes under siege ) because his ego could never permit any doubt as to the outcome ; his action scenes are like harlem globetrotters games without the showmanship . it's that ego of his which makes so many seagal films so wonderfully , terribly predictable . when he stops fire down below dead in its tracks to give a mini-version of his on deadly ground speech on environmental responsibility , you know it's because he genuinely believes someone cares what he thinks on the subject . -- you know it's because he's not about to take orders . and when he tries to work up some sensitive romantic chemistry with marg helgenberger , you want to laugh out loud at the idea that he could love anyone as much as he loves himself . sure , you can always count on a few token surprises , most of them completely ridiculous . there's a needless and unpleasant subplot about incestuous siblings -- nothing like dismantling appalachian stereotypes -- and a few colorful bursts of conveniently fluorescent toxic goop . mostly , however , there's more of the same fight-chase-explosion narrative structure and automoton emoting which makes the latest steven seagal film a natural sequel to the last steven seagal film . there's nothing remotely entertaining about fire down below , but there's something steadying about seagal's artistic intransigence . in turbulent times , you can almost take comfort in the knowledge that one man's name is as good as a plot description . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
0	a fairly-routine ww11 action-packed film . the best thing that could be said about the film , is that it avoids a lot of the usual cornball war film clich ? s about the brotherhood between the troops . its rise in critical evaluation over the years , where it was once reviewed as a typical war movie but now because of siegal's rising star as a director , has been granted " cult status , " which resulted in receiving much higher praise than i think it deserves . what siegel did for this b&w film , along with ww11 expert robert pirosh , was tighten up the script , make it more suspenseful , and emphasized the psychological differences between the few men of the 2nd squad and the pyschopathological attitude of the mcqueen character . the film opens in montigny , france-1944 . after the men spot this , newhart goes into a telephone routine he used as a stand-up comedian , but only here it is not funny and seems out of place . this is a film that builds to a climax for its brutal payoff . the men seem to think that this makes sense . he won't do anything until he clears it with pike . pike in a friendly gesture asks reese : " were you right ? " reese responds : " how the hell do i know . " >from the film's title , you can determine how the film will end , as the men prepare to attack the german pillbox , strengthened by company reinforcements . the film can make claim to its antiwar sentiments by showing the insanity of the attack . for me it was just another war film , nothing special . 
0	robin williams's movies can be easily dichotomized into the brilliant ( awakenings and mrs . jakob the liar falls firmly into the latter category . with an extremely underdeveloped script by the director , peter kassovitz , the movie has maybe 10 minutes worth of ideas , which after almost two hours it stretches way beyond the breaking point . if it is supposed to be a comedy , it's not a funny one , not even a laughably bad one . and , if kassovitz intended to make a serious picture , then he should have created characters that were more than stick figures . the actors , who deliver uniformly bad performances , all fidget as if the canteen on the set served only large mugs of strong coffee . watching the actors cavort around is , frankly , rather embarrassing . the movie is one that will have you getting better acquainted with your watch . some slightly whimsical music is about as funny as the movie ever gets . the dialog for the serious parts is leaden ( " who knows more about human relations than actors and barbers ? " overall , the story is so underdeveloped that it's almost inert . usually , when robin williams fails , it's with shamelessly schmaltzy acting as in patch adams . this time he makes the mistake of offering his viewers an almost lifeless character that makes passing the time while waiting for the ending credits extremely tedious . let's hope that next time will be one of his good movies . no -- we're due . jakob the liar runs a very long 1 : 55 . it is rated pg-13 for violence and disturbing images . think of the movie , with its scenes of graphic torture , as an r . 
0	the fundamental requirement of a director is that his actors should never appear to be such . the movie has many an interesting vignette , but never do his actors become flesh-and-blood characters . instead , the actors strut their stuff and show off their craft but nothing more . maybe it's because this play isn't suitable material for a motion picture , or maybe it's because warchus , whose background is as a stage director , doesn't understand the needs of the cinema . whatever the reason , simpatico just limps tediously along until the ending credits put it out of its misery . catherine keener , who can playing working-class types better than just about anyone , is cecilia , a payless store clerk , who is vinnie's girlfriend -- well , kind of . vinnie is such a filthy , no-account that it's hard to see how anyone could tolerate him for more than a few moments . lacking any sustained momentum , the movie just ends . just before the ending , the story interjects a completely predictable , but nevertheless ridiculous , little melodrama . it's the type of pseudo-tragedy that will leave you murmuring to yourself , " oh , come on ! " it is rated r for some strong sexuality and for language and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
2	with just the sort of script that hitchcock would have been drawn to , the minus man features everyday people who aren't always quite what they seem . full of small twists and subplots , the deliciously diabolical drama stars owen wilson as vann siegert , a likeable all-american boy type , who has just one tiny flaw -- he's a serial killer . vann , a deranged young adult , is really a sweet blonde with a strong moral code , just not a normal one . ( " i take the natural momentum of a person and draw it toward me . " " i never make a plan . written and directed by hampton fancher , the co-writer of blade runner , the minus man should get bonus points for its trailer . in an age in which studios think that audiences will not see a movie unless the entire plot is revealed in the trailers , the minus man dares to have a trailer that features not a single clip from the film . all you see in it are two fictional people leaving the movie , arguing about it . a meticulous and delicate little mystery and thriller , the minus man can be thought of as the anti-scream -- low on gore , as if the killer himself made the movie . he's a gentle soul , who wouldn't want to disturb the audience . like most of the story , everything is suspect . quirky doug is a conundrum . who did it ? or maybe , doug himself ? some of the story's puzzles are immediately solved while others fester . showing a na ? ve and playfully alluring side rarely seen , garofalo proves that the studios may have incorrectly pigeonholed her . hitchcock understood the power of humor , something the minus man could have used more often . " i look so hard , i forget there's nothing to find . " bobby bukowski's intimately lit cinematography , full of close-ups , gives the striking picture a realism and an immediacy . although the film's deliberately slow pacing will undoubtedly irritate some , the director's style is more mesmerizing than soporific . with fancher averaging about a script a decade , one would hope that this film will boost his cachet in hollywood and he will be sought out more often . it is rated r for language and a scene of drug use and would be fine for teenagers . 
0	a slickly done , very depressive melodrama about those addicted to drugs and their dreams of happiness . it's a film that has excellent performances , especially , the brilliant one by ellen burstyn , as the pill popping old lady who morbidly changes her appearance for the worst after taking diet pills . aronofsky stylishly uses his camera to make us feel the internal grief of those who are looking for an easy way out of their empty lives . it's not an easy film to find comfort in , or feel anything but revulsion at the sight of the constant degradation of human beings taking place . it's also not an easy film to enjoy or to find any insights it has about drug addictions that are fresh . the best scenes in the film were when either harry or sara were reaching out to the other to send out messages of hope . by the film's end , not much substance came through all the stylishly and graphically depressing experiences the four main characters underwent ; what i mostly felt was tired from their actions and not wanting to see any more of their hellish experiences . it's a movie where the first half of it was clearly more subtle and better done than the more morbid and predictable second half . i can applaud the director for his visual style of filmmaking and the actors for giving voice to their characters on the screen in a realistic way , but the story of four losers who can't get out of brooklyn still seems very ordinary despite all the high gloss attached to it . 
1	cast : alan rickman , hugh grant , georgina cates , alun armstrong , alan cox , carol drinkwater , peter firth , nicola paggett , edward petherbridge , prunella scales director : mike newell producer : hilary heath , philip hinchcliffe screenplay : charles wood based on the novel by beryl bainbridge cinematography : dick pope music : richard hartley u . s . distributor : miramax films an awfully big adventure , director mike newell's followup to his international hit , four weddings and a funeral , has little in common with that riotously funny comedy . grim , somber , and chaotic , this film takes a look at life behind the scenes of a small , low-budget theater troupe performing in liverpool during the late 1940s , with special emphasis on one young girl's loss of innocence . it's potentially compelling material , but the script and editing are a mess . an awfully big adventure is so badly disjointed that it never really gets on track . entire scenes seem to be missing and often what is there makes little sense . added to that , a crucial character doesn't make his first appearance until more than halfway through the proceedings . by that time , my patience with this rambling motion picture was wearing thin . stella , as nicely played by georgina cates , is ostensibly the film's central character--at least for the first hour . neither stella nor o'hara really captures the audience's sympathy , so the shifting perspective further distances the viewer from the lives being autopsied by newell's direction . the actors are a ragtag bunch-- " the very best . . . exposed to such excellent examples of human degradation , it's no surprise that stella's own moral character goes into rapid decline . the cast is top-notch , with only hugh grant struggling to find his character . despite the solid performances , however , the uneven tone and porous script keep the viewer at arm's length . several attempts at comedy are off-putting , primarily because they occur at inappropriate moments . a vast departure from recent newell successes like four weddings and enchanted april , an awfully big adventure aims for , and largely misses , a rich emotional vein . stella's story is a tragedy with the sort of universal scope everyone can understand . unfortunately , this film mishandles its primary subject matter . the behind-the-scenes wrangling of actors is entertaining , as is the sniping between potter and the members of his troupe , but these are peripheral issues . and that's the problem--the movie doesn't have a clear idea of what it's really trying to do . the result is that an awfully big adventure is awfully unsatisfying . 
2	a watermark -- why didn't he think of that ? american psycho is a dark , dark comedy that feels like it was directed by alfred hitchcock on overdrive and scripted by the marquis de sade for a late night movie on the comedy channel . in a masterful performance , christian bale approaches his role with utter seriousness . one of his favorites is an axe with a handle that looks like platinum . luckily , the script is quite funny , which keeps the film from becoming unbearably intense . a sterling cast nicely complement bale's marvelous work . reese witherspoon plays evelyn williams , whom he describes as " my supposed fianc ? e . " patrick's life is rather like the nightmare dream sequences found in other movies . it won't . filmed in cold , steel blues and complementary warm skin tones , the movie looks great . my main problem with the film is a simple one . why did they even bother cutting a few scenes -- sorry about the pun -- in order to get an r rather than an nc-17 rating ? an nc-17 would have been a much more honest and appropriate rating for a film with such extremely black humor and explicit violence . the studio should have just marketed the movie as something for adults and bragged in the ads that it had to be an nc-17 . so what if some movie theaters won't show nc-17 films , and some newspapers won't advertise them ? if ever there was a movie that isn't for everyone , it is american psycho . like very bad things , which featured unabashedly morbid humor , american psycho is a treat for the adventuresome filmgoer . it is rated r for strong violence , sex , nudity , drug usage and language and would be acceptable for people 18 and up . 
2	producers : armyan bernstein and amy robinson . director : sam raimi mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , brief gore ) running time : 138 minutes . arguably his two strongest performances -- in two of his strongest films -- have come when he was dealing with baseball : bull durham , and field of dreams . there's something about costner , some combination of his convincingly athletic build and his aw-shucks , laconic manner that makes him well-suited to tales of our peculiarly mythologized national pastime . it's only natural that he'd want to return to the diamond for a film like for love of the game . could he maintain his perfect batting average , even playing a non-hitting american league pitcher ? the short answer is yes , though it's more of a solid single than field of dreams' ground-rule double or bull durham's inside-the-park home run . for love of the game is deftly constructed as perhaps the ideal date movie -- it's a love story that also happens to be a baseball movie . though costner is plenty agreeable in his easy-going way , it's preston who really sells the romantic side of the story . the chemistry between preston and costner is solid , but there's a nagging sense that there's much more to know about billy . the absence of any previous romantic history for billy robs the love story of context ; it's hard to see the person he was , so we can feel for the person he needs to become . some of that context is provided by the baseball sequences , which are satisfying in their own right . though there are a couple of technical blunders -- a scoreboard that shows no hits for both teams shortly before the announcer says the tigers have two hits -- the game sequences do their job as character development . still , it's sometimes difficult to lock into the fate of billy and jane's relationship , not because of the distractions of the game sequences , but because billy remains so enigmatic . in another sense , that mystery could simply be a distraction from a viewer's confidence that these two people actually belong together . make no mistake , for love of the game is fundamentally satisfying -- it can't help but be with _two_ big payoff scenes -- and well-acted . director sam raimi delivers the crowd-pleasing goods , and the film delivers more laughs than you might expect . i only wish billy chapel had been more of a complete character , and less one of those baseball icons costner has exploited so successfully in other films . it just could have been better . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	a zippy youth oriented christmas movie ( though there is no bing singing white christmas in this one ) marketed for the druggie generation of post-teens and those in their late 20s , that is perhaps a cut above the rest of the mindless offerings flooding the market to capture filmland's largest share of ticket buyers , as it tells its somewhat derivative black comic tale , ( pulp fiction type dialogue and style ) , fuelled by the originality of its accelerated pace , using the cool life-style in lala land as its backdrop , and telling about its main characters who either work in a supermarket or are involved small time in using or pushing pills . in this frenetically paced film , the innovative young director , doug liman , following his indie debut feature , swingers , shows that he has a feel for these young people and their problematic world , as he grapples with their realities , giving us a good look at how they view themselves , their job and their customers . the most amusing bit , is that we see her pushing aspirins and sinus pills as substitutes for the hallucinogenic ectasy pill , at a party , where those who are there , are so high already , they don't know the difference from one pill to the other . i though fichtner was the funniest and most malevolent one in the film . i don't think the film had much to say about much of anything , including the use of drugs , but it hit hard at being an hilarious film , with its fast-paced mood swings , its sharp editing cuts and frequent light changes , allowing its story to be easy to watch , and imbuing the characters with a certain attitude about them , that made their performances seem eclectic . i especially liked sarah polley , when she wasn't on the screen the film seemed to lack purpose . in any case , go has watch ability because of its raw energy , and the way it was able to get inside a pill poppers head and to convey on screen how hallucinatory his world looks when he is high . yet the film for all its innovative features , still could not escape , from being on the edge of sitcom and not on the edge of innovative filmmaking . the film's appeal is still mostly with the younger generation . they are the ones who are mostly likely to be amused at how the main characters in the story comport themselves , while the older generations might not be as amused , and feel put off by the lack of any character depth or real wit in the story . and the benign ending , not only didn't make sense , but seemed artificial and embarrassing to watch . it was as if this film after using all its energy in rebellion , now wants to conform and give the adults a happy ending . 
2	in la femme nikita , writer/director luc besson proved his capability of putting as much octane and adrenaline into a thriller as any american director while keeping his formula uniquely non-hollywood . much the same is true of the professional , which has sequences to rival those of speed for white-knuckle excitement--not to mention a plot that's equally as preposterous . although not well-founded in reality , these two characters mesh nicely . despite an occasional low-key hint of sexual attraction , this is basically a father/daughter or mentor/apprentice relationship . there's nothing unique about a young girl melting the heart of a hardened loner except the manner in which besson approaches the theme . he does more with mannerisms and body language than with facial expressions , and the closer he is drawn to mathilda , the more uncomfortable he appears . the less traditional role belongs to an impressive natalie portman , yet another member of the highly-talented , recent group of youthful actors . there are likely some viewers who will be disturbed by mathilda's predilection for profanity . because of the non-american flavor brought to this film by besson , the professional is anything but typical fare . it is stylish , darkly humorous , and almost artsy in its approach to the genre . nevertheless , it delivers what viewers want from any thriller : lots of action . with some surprisingly strong character interaction , there's a lot to like about this movie , at least for those willing to look beyond all the bloodshed . at one point , leon comments to an attentive mathilda that " the closer you get to being a pro , the closer you can get to the client . " through the intimacy of the link forged by besson with his audience , there's no doubt that he's as much the consummate professional as his implacable title character . 
2	perform without benefit of a corset ? for the latest gilbert and sullivan opera , the actors and actresses have been firmly instructed not to wear their corsets . none of them have ever gone on stage without a corset before , so pandemonium has set in . in a lesser performance , allan corduner plays arthur sullivan as somewhat of an enigma . " i merely bask in your reflecting glory . " but corduner gives us little appreciation of sullivan's actual gifts . that he had higher aspirations than gilbert is made apparent but little more . the film's momentum suffers greatly from leigh's proclivity to include such extraneous material as dentist visits and to let some scenes run on for what seems an eternity . if you don't like gilbert and sullivan operas , imagine how painful having long passages read aloud will be . all the picture's production sins , and they are many , are eventually redeemed as you become part of the show . by the end you'll feel like you've signed on to sing in the chorus . filmed by dick pope in garish colors , the movie makes gilbert and sullivan's style of comedic opera look attractive and funny . the opera as kitsch was something that gilbert himself was unclear about . he describes " the mikado " as " not grand opera but low burlesque . " this is an entirely new japanese opera . " yet , he wasn't happy . among the film's small delights are leigh's fascination with the scientific instruments of the time and their effect on the operation of an opera company . from the telephone to the " reservoir pen " to the special effects , each contributes in it's own way to the opera's production . nothing , however , can make up for the fact that the movie is a full hour too long . films like this almost make you wish for a dastardly studio executive to seize the print and cut it down to the proper size . movie after movie this holiday season feels as bloated as a diner after a big christmas dinner . even with its excesses , however , topsy-turvy is a good-spirited and intriguing behind-the-scenes look at a stage production and is worth seeing . it is rated r for a scene of risqu ? nudity and would be fine for teenagers . 
1	most americans first saw lee's work in nike commercials of the late 80s , featuring michael jordan and lee himself as she's gotta have it character mars blackmon . make no mistake , spike loves his hoops . i can't help but feel that love clouded lee's judgment as he put together he got game . the corrupt race to recruit top high school athletes isn't exactly fresh subject matter , having already appeared in the 1994 film blue chips . lee puts a humorous spin on some of the ridiculous excesses of the process , but his real chance at originality would have been putting us inside the head of the young men , most from impoverished backgrounds , facing these dizzying attempts to influence . that's somwhere lee and first-time actor ray allen never take us , allowing us to see the insanity without allowing us to understand how jesus really feels about it . allen looks comfortable enough on screen , but his character is too passive , so fundamentally decent he never seems fazed by anything . lee has a lot of stuff he wants to show us ; jesus's role is more or less to absorb it all . if lee had centered on that relationship , he got game might have been a truly memorable film . there's enough thematic material here for two films ; lee decides to make them both simultaneously . the resulting film feels scattershot , heavy on interesting images and ideas but light on cohesiveness . somewhere in there is an engrossing family drama , often relegated to the nosebleed seats while lee keeps pulling us courtside to watch his inner city story with a basketball backdrop turn into a basketball story . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
2	farewell my concubine , director chen kaige's 1992 epic drama , told a tale about sex and friendship against a turbulent political backdrop . temptress moon , the film maker's 1996 followup ( which premiered with much hoopla at that year's cannes film festival ) has similar intentions , but less successful results . rather than existing as a deeply-moving exploration of characters and relationships , temptress moon plunges into a sudsy , melodramatic formula that it never quite manages to escape from . the film boasts many interesting elements , but , in comparison to concubine , it's a disappointing effort . we are introduced to the three main characters -- zhongliang , ruyi , and duanwu -- as children , before the film skips forward in time to the 1920s . chen's story is interesting , but not ground-breaking , and it lacks the multi-layered depth of his previous effort . at its heart , temptress moon is about the war between the sexes at a time when women's equality was a phrase rarely uttered within china's borders . it's fascinating to watch the intricate dance that these three go through as they fight to emerge unscathed , and to recognize that love not only complicates the battle , but raises the stakes . the political climate of the 1920s serves as the film's background rather than an integral part of the proceedings -- the story could have been moved forward or backward in time without many changes . however , since the period details are among temptress moon's strengths , such an adjustment would have deprived audiences of some impressive visual elements . chen's 1920s atmosphere is strongest at a train station and on city streets , but its influence pervades the entire picture . regardless of its other flaws , this , like many chinese motion pictures , is visually sumptuous . the acting of the leads is nearly flawless . many of their scenes sizzle and one in particular -- a confrontation in shanghai when ruyi demands to know if zhongliang loves her -- is charged with emotional power . kevin lin is equally good in a role that demands more subtlety . duanwu's participation in the war of the sexes is less obvious than that of the other two , but critical to the outcome . temptress moon requires concentration , especially at the beginning , because , as scenes change and the story makes occasionally-jarring chronological jumps , it's easy to lose track of who the characters are and how they relate to each other . miramax has attempted to ease the burden by supplying descriptive subtitles , but it's only a minor aid . it's curious that the two latest chinese films to feature gangsters ( this and zhang yimou's shanghai triad ) are among the weakest recent cinematic exports from those shores . perhaps the film makers are so concerned with capturing the mystique of the era that they lose sight of the deeper thematic and plot-related elements that have made movies like farewell my concubine and raise the red lantern modern classics . but , although temptress moon falls short of the lofty perch upon which those pictures reside , there's still something compelling about the rhythm of this film , and the ending has its own brand of power . temptress moon is a flawed motion picture , but still makes for worthwhile viewing . 
1	director : steve miner . for a while there , i had declared a personal moratorium on disney's live-action formula pictures . although i found cool runnings moderately entertaining , i realized that was about as much as i could expect : a smile here , a chuckle there , something i'd take my kids to see if i had any and wanted to get them out of the house on a saturday afternoon . with the presence of gerard depardieu , i had slightly higher hopes for my father the hero , but i was kidding myself . while he lends a roguish charm to the proceedings , he's still trapped in a movie which seems designed more to divert than to entertain . it would be one thing if my father the hero were simply predictable , which it is , but it is also just badly written . my father the hero is based on a french film i have not seen titled mon pere , ce heros , but it is hard to believe that the characters could have been as fuzzy as they are here . the lies are just a device , and even if we believe it's just adolescence at work there's no particular reason to care . one doesn't necessarily expect well-rounded characters from a film like my father the hero , but one should at leas find reasonably coherent types . still , as silly and incoherent as the script may be , gerard depardieu still gets to read many of the lines , and he has superb comic timing . but it's part of the problem that he has such a rapport with everyone ; if part of the point is that andre needs to become a better father and a more selfless person , we never see any indication that he is anything but a perfectly nice guy , if slightly overprotective . there would have been so many more comic possibilities in a rakish playboy being saddled with everyone's belief that he is a cradle-robber . heigl is lovely as nicole , perhaps too lovely ; i'm not sure why she'd need to lie to hook anyone . my father , the hero is wholesome , good-natured and does virtually nothing to offend . but it needs more than that , namely something to make it worth ninety minutes of anyone's time . gerard depardieu is fun to watch , and proves surprisingly adept at physical comedy . it would have been nice to see him work with a script that seemed to have any imagination or sense of structure behind it . 
2	screenplay : robert altman and frank barhydt . director : robert altman . point #1 : raymond carver purists might be extremely disappointed in what robert altman has done to some of the best short stories written in the english language . the interlocking story structure of short cuts does not serve those stories well , and the small pathos of carver's pacific northwest isn't the same in altman's los angeles . point #2 : short cuts stands independently as a splendid film achievement , a brutally funny collection of fragments from broken lives crafted by a director with renewed vitality . only an abiding cynicism and the uneven appeal of the nine main stories mar this dynamic , poetic work . short cuts is about those moments when individuals are at their most basic , naked and vulnerable . indeed , nakedness and scatology play a key role in the film , perhaps more than some viewers might find palatable . characters in short cuts pop zits , break wind , urinate into streams , talk bluntly about sexuality and wander around in various states of undress , but none of these elements ever seem gratuitous . in one of the film's most memorable moments , julianne moore stands before husband matthew modine making a painful confession , with evidence that she is a natural redhead in full view . this is a film loaded with individual moments that slam home with the intensity of reality recognized , and frequently inspire nervous laughter . while the structure serves a purpose in emphasizing a great tapestry of lives , the impact of carver's individual stories is largely lost . it's true that i'm criticizing the film short cuts is not rather than the film it is , but it just seems a shame that such rich source material is given such a cursory treatment . altman never seems to identify with his own characters the way carver did , and as a result it seems he's laughing at them and not with them . opinions will vary as to which stories worked best . at over three hours , short cuts is anything but boring . it's a sharp , clever , perceptive look at life in the big city that goes for the jugular rather than the heartstrings . these short cuts are somewhat cold cuts , but they're mighty tasty . 
2	and the winner of the best picture that year , as well as well as seven other oscars , was gone with the wind . easily one of the best motion pictures ever made , it has been restored and released to the theaters . the print is clean and handsome , the digitally remastered sound is strong and clear and this time they are showing all of the movie . to make the movie look more modern , the last few times it has been released in wide-screen by chopping off the top and bottom . this time it is being distributed in the 4 : 3 aspect ratio of the original release . the epic motion picture is part romance , part history , part character study and part the world's most popular soap opera . our packed audience treated the film almost reverentially . as the fickle but resilient scarlett , vivien leigh gives a tour de force performance . " if i hear one more word about war , i'll run in the house and slam the door ! " her world of fancy balls and bbqs will not countenance any such intrusion , even if the first shots of the civil war have already been fired . the intense foreboding of this outwardly happy scene makes it arguably the movie's most moving . chips , has a ball playing rhett butler , the story's loveable rapscallion . with his hearty laugh and his sneer of a grin , rhett is a natural charmer without trying to be so . " we're bad lots , both of us - selfish and shrewd , " he tells her in a succinct summation of their characters . butterfly mcqueen is hilarious as the comically incompetent slave , prissy . ( " miss scarlett , i don't know nothing about birthing no babies ! " ) but it is hattie mcdaniel as mammy , scarlett's rock of gibraltar , who delivers the strongest performance as a slave and later a servant . hattie deservedly won the best supporting actress that year , beating out de havilland , whose performance was superlative . " you can do without a reputation . " ) the artistic aspects of the film's production are as stunning as its acting . the oscar-winning cinematography by ernest haller and ray rennahan added to the vastness of the picture . shooting outdoors with heavy emphasis on silhouettes set against rust-colored evening skies or orange-hued burning cities , they created a tableaux so expansive as to make audience's mouths drop . max steiner's nostalgic music , which lost the oscar to the even better score of the wizard of oz , is as moving as it is memorable . the only problem with the picture is that it could have used a little judicious pruning . the international travel sequences , for example , add little . gone with the wind is a picture deserving of a restoration every decade . see it , if you can , in a theater . in fact , see all of the classics , if you can , in a theatrical setting . television is fine , but classics deserve better for their full appreciation . it is rated g , but with its war violence and frightening images it is inappropriate for most kids under around 8 . and it may not hold any interest for kids under 10 or 11 . my son jeffrey , age 9 , was well behaved through a long movie that he hated . he found it boring and frightening and gave it only * ? . finally , he said that it should have been rated pg . 
2	holding that oscar , plus the time president clinton shook my hand , will be among those small events of my life that i will never forget . ) if you have never heard of the poet , journalist , and remarkable human being called mark o'brien , you are not usual . yu said she was pleased that they had the faith that she could make serious films as well . o'brien calls his iron lung , " a huge and ugly machine , " which it certainly is . with few living polio patients left requiring iron lungs , the medical industry has little incentive to devise something more efficacious than this hideous looking piece of 1950's technology . ( the film hit home for me . the belief was that the virus was airborne , and the warm weather was when it was most likely to strike . people at the time did not know whether this theory was valid or pure quackery , but without a serum to prevent the disease , parents tried whatever they could . old footage of this adds extra poignancy and immediacy to the picture . o'brien's thoughts are more down to earth than hawking's but nevertheless intriguing . yu manages to know how to ask just the right questions to draw him out and has an excellent sense of how to collect her material into a compelling whole . after the screening i got a chance to talk with yu , and she told me that o'brien has had the most wonderful thing happen to him . yu said that she is working now on the possibility of turning o'brien's story into a full length drama and has a studio interested . the most recent work of hers to get wide distribution is an hour long documentary on civil war reenactors . finally , if you saw the academy awards , you will remember her from her acceptance speech where she mused her dress cost more than her film . almost . she said that her movie cost a little more than her gown , but less than just one of her earrings . breathing lessons runs a little under 40 minutes . the film is subtitled in english since about 10 percent of o'brien's speech can be difficult to understand . the film is not rated but might be pg-13 for the discussion of sex . it would be fine for kids say nine or ten and up to see . i recommend it to you and give it * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	rodriguez's impressive acting debut , however , is the only real reason to see girlfight . although first-time writer and director karyn kusama spent 5 years preparing this project , the script is significantly underdeveloped and the director sets a lethargic pace . think of the film as rocky on valium . there's lots of brooding teenage angst , but remarkably little ever happens . the picture follows a completely formulaic arc toward the big concluding match . even though the movie wants badly to be taken as something more than another rocky balboa story . nevertheless , the movie is one-idea story -- girl rather than boy as young boxer -- that never gets fleshed out beyond its concept . the only surprise is how the final fight is edited . after waiting for an entire movie for it come alive , the ending bout happens so fast that , if you blink a few times , you'll miss it . i told actor santiago douglas , who was at our screening , that i did not like the way it was edited down to almost nothing . i agree . " it is rated r for language and would be acceptable for teenagers . 
1	a real-life chilling tale of matricide is put forth in a complex build-up of an obsessive and passionate relationship between two very imaginative adolescent girls , set in christchurch , new zealand , between 1953 and 1954 . the 33-year-old director , new zealander peter jackson ( braindead/dead alive ) , previously known for making gore films , has come up with a stunning melodramatic story , spoiled only by the director's excessive camera shots of the girls' fantasy world , which was more arty than enlightening . pauline is shy but bright , heavy-set and plain looking , from a working-class and uneducated family , with a scarred leg from a few operations due to weak bone structure ; while , juliet is pretty and slender , worldly , aggressively sure of herself , from an upper-class , well-educated family , but is suffering from tuberculosis . by tossing fantasy and reality together in such a haphazard manner , it creates a world of disturbing visions , one in which the film holds the viewer's interest throughout . it feels like we can't quite grasp what is on the girls' minds , even if we are privileged to hear pauline's troubling voiceover , explaining her diary notations , even if we are caught by the exilaratingly romantic moods of the girls and their imaginative games they play . the acting by winslet and lynskey is superb . the film is also visually stunning , but the moral of the story is never made clear and there is bit too much pretentious fantasy art thrown into the script . 
0	producers : john hughes and ricardo mestres . director : stephen herek . running time : 103 minutes , plus 7 minute short in some theaters . resolved : trained dogs are cute , and puppies scampering about are even cuter . if you would take the con position in an oxford-style debate on this point , then the live-action remake of disney's 101 dalmatians is not going to be your cup of kibble . 101 dalmatians was made not simply with an awareness of the usefulness of cute animals in the making of a family film ; it seems to have been constructed around that awareness . there is such a crass calculation to the use of its canine stars as bringers of innocent grins that the dogs don't even counteract the brain-damaging slapstick which is john hughes's stock-in-trade . somehow , they make it worse . delivered for the holiday season in a big glossy bow , 101 dalmatians is a spectacularly packaged box of foul-smelling air . the 1961 animated version of 101 dalmatians was far from the best of disney's self-proclaimed " masterpieces , " but it had a low-key charm even in the bumblings of horace and jasper . now the material has been entrusted to writer-producer john hughes , whose basic film-making philosophy is " if more is better , and even more is even better , then please-make-it-stop too much is just right . " even the magnificent , maleficent cruella is not safe from the onslaught of indignities , falling first into a vat of molasses and then into a pile of manure . it is a sign of hughes's love affair with " america's funniest home videos " humor that he replaces the original's most memorable suspense sequence -- the puppies' attempt to slip past cruella disguised as black labradors -- and replaces it with a scene in a barn which ends with a pig landing on cruella's chest . glenn close has obvious fun as cruella , playing her as an imperious drag queen , but i'm mystified by raves for her performance . there is no doubt that close can be scary -- she scared a generation of married men into zipping up their pants in fatal attraction -- but there is no malevolence in her characterization of cruella . disney's great villains were real threats , and they didn't take pratfalls ; cruella has horace and jasper so that _they_ can be the comic relief while she spooks the little ones . close cuts a fine figure in cruella's outrageous outfits and commanding some impressive sets , and she is about as intimidating as rupaul . then there are those adorable puppies . there is no point arguing that kids and many adults won't enjoy the frolicking dalmatians , because they will . there are a few marvelously trained animals in 101 dalmatians , and they provide some amusing moments . you could also get the same reaction out of most kids if you sat them down in front of a home movie of puppies playing , or an old episode of " those amazing animals , " or even a westminster dog show on espn2 , because reaction to the dogs in 101 dalmatians is not based on any kind of plot requiring individual personality for the animal characters . though the same kind of animatronic critters used in babe are used in 101 dalmatians , the animals don't talk here . not only does that make for some confusing narrative ( one scene found several kids around me perplexed as to why lucky was still in danger ) , but it makes the canine cast of 101 dalmatians little more than a big spotted blur . a certain kind of manipulative drama has long been called a " tear-jerker , " and 101 dalmatians is the family film equivalent . it's an " awww-jeker , " trotting out the adorable little puppies and having them yap at you until you begin to consider turning them into a coat yourself .

" psychologists have always talked of how powerful men have a need to be dominated--murakami has applied this to the collective psyche of an entire country . the sex in this film , while abundant and explicit , is definitely not erotic . viewers are more likely to be sickened than titillated . murakami didn't make this film to tickle people's libidos ; he wanted to bring out the potential ugliness that can come through sex . in that , he has succeeded abundantly . tokyo decadence is graphic but not gratuitous , and i can't go into details about some of the humiliation that ai is put through without proof that the reader of this review is over eighteen . tokyo decadence is so bleak that without the inclusion of a brief scene designed primarily for comic relief , this would have been as close to unbearable a movie as i have ever seen . as is often true of cautionary tales , the stuff of tokyo decadence is too strong for mere entertainment . that having been said , there is still a story with characters . of all the people we meet , only ai attains depth , but she is brilliantly fleshed-out by the script and portrayed by actress miho nikaido , who has to put a lot of herself on the line to appear in some of tokyo decadence's scenes . few performers are willing to expose themselves to this much humiliation and degradation--even if it is only on film--to bring a character to life . for most of the movie , the plot is reasonable , if not overly-involving . often , movies conclude with let-downs , but in the case of tokyo decadence , there's a complete collapse . the last twenty minutes are so poorly put together that they're virtually not worth sitting through . the drawn-out finale is tedious , and seriously damaged my overall impression of the movie . five minutes would have been more than enough time to bang home murakami's final point . production-wise , the picture is a mixed bag . the musical score is poor , sounding like a badly-synthesized composition lifted directly from some cheap 1970s american flick . the cinematography is equally of dubious quality . in attempting to highlight the dispiriting nature of the film , many of the scenes were shot in conditions of low lighting . unfortunately , sometimes things are so dark that it's difficult to figure out what's going on . tokyo decadence is a movie that will appeal only to a select few . strong stomachs and a willingness to see almost anything are requisite . the movie is rated nc-17 for a reason . those who take a chance on this film may be disappointed by some of what it has to offer , but the overall experience won't soon be forgotten . 
2	songcatcher , written and directed by maggie greenwald , is a charming film that could almost be a hallmark hall of fame television movie given its norman rockwell brand of folksy americana . hallmark , however , would probably not be comfortable with the amount of implicit sex going on and would want to cut short the songs which fill almost every scene . the film was a hit at 2000's sundance film festival . it's an unusual picture , essentially a musical of folk ballads . it may not have much a narrative drive , but it sure can carry a tune . yep , you guessed it . the movie is best when it lets the music flow , which is most of the time . the songs , both romantic and tragic , are uniformly lovely , regardless of the singing ability of the person singing them . less effective are the moments when the movie tries to go on message . a movie like this that is built with a collection of little incidents has trouble ending . the dramatic incident that greenwald comes up with is a bit too easy to foretell and is allowed to occur too easily by those involved . but the story has to end somehow , and the way greenwald chooses is reasonable even if not especially inspired . songcatcher leaves you in a state of bliss as the music floats through your mind like a billowy cloud on a lazy summer day . songcatcher runs 1 : 52 . it is rated pg-13 for sexual content and an intense scene of childbirth and would be acceptable for kids around 11 or 12 and up . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
0	the set up of the plot is fascinating . it is cast with great people , and it had terrific trailers . this is a single joke movie . we have an increasing larger and very realistically pregnant schwarzenegger as a caricature of a pregnant woman . he gets to utter every cliche possible . it works okay for the first 5 minutes and then you start checking your watch . i don't blame arnold - an actor i absolutely love . it is the scriptwriter's and the director's fault , not arnold's . devito plays devito . in junior he is not believable or funny as an obstetrician . the sad part is that emma thompson , whom i think is brilliant , is totally wasted in this movie . it is frequently embarrassing watching her . she has no dialog worth remembering . gosh , i sure had some belly laughs over that original material . on the good side , you get to see a lot of scenes of berkeley's life sciences building plus beautiful images of living in the best parts of san francisco . i give the show a single * and do not recommend it . it is correctly rated pg-13 for adult themes . it runs a very long 1 : 50 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	this is a dull , unfunny film , lacking an edge to it , as if the screenwriter is past his prime and maybe should take a year off to re-gain his touch . this sitcom film is actually worst than most sitcoms seen on tv ; it should have come with canned laughter . in the theater i saw it , no one laughed ; and , watching a comedy without hearing any laughs gives me a creepy feeling . the film lacked the kind of comedy expected for a satire . even if the story never took off , i at least expected the film to have some snappy things to say about those who are part of the hollywood establishment and not to mirror it so closely with the hollywood scene that it can't even be considered a parody anymore . i thought brooks mailed this script in . it was hard to think of brooks as a victim of hollywood when he was surrounded by so much wealth and the only thing he strove for was to become even wealthier . he never asked the muse to inspire him to write a great classic , only for some " summer script " he can sell to the studios as a blockbuster movie . if he was trying for a parody ( which i assume he was ) , he just didn't succeed . all he succeeded in showing was that there is some bitterness in him and that he's part of the " fat cats " who make up the hollywood scene , too complacent to make a real satire with some bite in it . but i think the main problem with the film , besides the fact that it's a one idea film , is how that idea was weak and never developed . the brooks character never spelled out why he was so desperate in the first place and he never showed us how good a writer he was . i feel i must question the film's intent : why should i feel sorry for brooks ? where is the comedy in the film ? what is this nonsense about getting a live muse supposed to mean ? what kind of statement is he making about creativity ? should i really believe that someone would have the chutzpah to make a film about a screenwriter who lost his touch and pays for a muse so he can get that touch back and makes a film that is so flat and uninspired ? is he trying to tell me that people in hollywood will believe in anything and so should i ? and there you have the funniest line in the film and it comes right in the beginning of the film . what goes for comedy in this film , has to do with his whiny relationship to the muse . that dumbness prevails , and he comes up with a lame idea for a film in which he wants to have jim carrey star in , is supposed to be his way of saying that hollywood doesn't know what's good from what's crap , or doesn't care . this is " i love lucy " kind of humor . that this film is about making money being tantamount in hollywood to creativity , is a theme that has been often done and this film has not touched on any new ground with that concept . if you make a satire , it better be funny , or if it is a more serious film , it should try to have a script with some characters who are profound and perceptive . to have a satire with nothing to dig into is unfortunate , as brooks chose to go for his laughs by having his character be a whiner , grousing about the demands of his muse , the attention she gives to his wife instead of him , how steven spielberg snubbed him , and how cruel it is to be in hollywood if you are a creative person . this slight aim at comedy turns this film into a slight film . if you really had to see this film , the only reason i could think of doing so , was to see the attractive sharon stone as a muse . even though the script did not provide her with material that was funny , she did show by her facial expressions and body language that she has a penchant for comedy if given a chance . at least she was more lovable than any one else in the film was . 
2	" power to the people and punish bad cinema ! " cecil b . demented is another deliciously over-the-top movie by that bad boy of indie films , outrageous writer and director john waters . although his last picture ( pecker ) was a disappointment , most of his movies , such as serial mom , are real treats . and this latest one of his is perhaps his best ever . melanie griffith , delivering her first good performance since , well , i don't remember when , plays the lead , a self-absorbed star named honey whitlock . honey coos sweet nothings to the press but , behind the scenes , is a trash-talking bitch . waters has the audience in stitches with the opening scene , which shows a multiplex whose films , according to the marquee , are star wars , star trek , star wars , star trek , star wars and star trek . these titles and others dissolve into the film's credits . keep your eye out for other marquees during the movie . the best advertises patch adams : the director's cut . ( since honey is kidnapped , much like patty hearst was , waters , in perfect bad taste , gets patty hearst to play a cameo part in the movie . ) the movie is filled with film industry in-jokes . " now i only have one problem . " a scene inside a porn house playing one cherish's movies is one of cecil b . demented's funniest sequences . waters even comes up with a catchy little song and a motto , " demented forever , " that will likely stay with you and remind you of this wacky and thoroughly enjoyable movie . so what is the ultimate insult to a deep , deep underground director like demented ? a prudish looking , family-film aficionado tells demented that , " you're direct-to-video . " oh , the pain ! it is rated r for strong crude sexual content , violence , language and drug use and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
2	starring : phoebe cates , jim broadbent , wendy hughes , stephen rea , kevin kline , john lithgow . screenplay : michael austin and john wells . director : michael austin . every once in a while , a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise . i don't necessarily mean in terms of quality ; rather , i'm referring to the mere knowledge of its existence . usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance , but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo . it has slipped rather quietly into limited release , and appears destined to slip out just as quietly . that's a shame , because princess caraboo is a delightful fable , romantic , gentle and very appealing . what's more , it's surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp-witted lesson in english social history . as a social satire and comedy of manners , princess caraboo is a winner . but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr . worrall , a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude . while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule , director and co-writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light-hearted to be heavy-handed . it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in " sensations , " an idea that takes on a timeless quality ( and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show ) . social commentary aside , princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment . the performers are mostly delightful , particularly phoebe cates , who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime . her supporting players are also appealing : wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs . worrall ; kevin kline as frixos , the worralls' suspicious and superior greek butler ; stephen rea as the world-weary but ultimately romantic gutch . only john lithgow is a disappointment , turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess's identity . the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt , without becoming gimmicky . it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isn't given more time to develop , because the potential seemed to be there . when it finally does blossom , it seems too quick to be plausible . princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp . still , it has both escapist and intellectual appeal , and is well worth seeking out . it is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewarding--a hidden gem . 
1	gillies mackinnon's handsomely shot hideous kinky contains enough lush visuals to serve as a moroccan travelogue , albeit one with a time warp . although the images are sometimes quite compelling , the threadbare story never is . billy mackinnon's thin script is based on a novel by esther freud . her life may have been exciting , but almost nothing happens in this movie . without much information , the viewers are left to piece together for themselves what the director is trying to say . this might lead us to believe that we are to feel compassion for a single parent coping with poverty , but the effects of being destitute are never made obvious . julia doesn't appear to be lacking much since her needs and desires are so modest . perhaps the movie is about the effects of bad parenting since julia does a better job of loving her children than caring for them . the characters are all written so superficially that one can never be sure what the filmmakers' intentions are . the film's title is completely misleading . there are no hideous , kinky sex scenes in the movie . a different title would have helped in marketing the film correctly , but perhaps the current one will prove more lucrative . after a reasonable amount of time has elapsed , the picture comes to a completely predictable conclusion . as we leave the theater , we remember the sights and sounds of marrakech . nothing more of the story lingers . none of the characters were interesting enough to care about when the movie was on . still , if you've been considering morocco for your next vacation , this might be just the movie for you . hideous kinky runs 1 : 38 . it is rated r for a little nudity , profanity , and sexuality and would be fine for teenagers . 
0	i would like to share with others that the fisher king is on my top of my worst movies of the year list . yes , i know the critics are going gaga over it . i found the jeff bridges character to be a total loser . his character taught me nothing other than it is pretty awful spending a lot of time with an alcoholic dead beat even if he is only on a movie screen . i found robin williams's character somewhat better , but spending hours a bum with a mental problem was not exactly terrific either . yes , i know i could use the politically correct term , " homeless " , and then i would have to view him reverentially . after an hour i walked out . i only wish i had been smart enough to do it sooner . i found that the images , especially that of jeff bridges , stayed with me for a while , and i did not like it . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : december 6 , 1991 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	roman polanski is a controversial , but extremely gifted director . undoubtedly giddy with the success of his rosemary's baby , roman polanski decided to approach his next film , a shakespearean play , in the same manner . with backing from playboy productions , his vision of macbeth is one of the lessor of the movies made from shakespeare's works . beside the slasher movie aspects , the film is filled with full frontal nudity . macbeth might have been finished before then . all i know for sure is that it was released in 1971 . ] all of this notwithstanding , the major problem with the film is that the acting is lifeless . yes , the shocking portions are there , but most of the acting is remarkably devoid of energy . polanski's direction serves more to confuse than to enlighten . if you are not already well versed in the play before you enter , you will undoubtedly leave shaking your head and wondering " what was that all about ? " polanski's macbeth has a traditional look . the sets and the costumes are quite realistic . the squalor of that period is in full evidence . from what i know of scottish history this is all authentic . the movie was actually filmed in wales , but that is another story . it paints a bleak picture of the landscape . rather than the picture postcard look , it goes with quite a depressing motif . polanski has his actors think aloud many of the lines as they walk rather than speak them . he is no kenneth branagh . if one of shakespeare's purpose in the play was to shock people with macbeth's dastardly deeds , then polanski's techniques are effective . as in most sequences , the words are literate but the acting is not . bayler has little screen presence which is the problem with most of actors in the film . only francesca annis gives a mildly interesting interpretation of a woman gone mad . regardless of all of its flaws , this is shakespeare , and the language is worth the price of admission . when macbeth wants to beat a fast exit , he does not say , " let's get out of here . " oh not , shakespearean prose is ever so much more elegant . macbeth advises , " let us not be dainty of our leave-taking . " don't you wish you could talk like that ? don't you wish everyone would talk like that ? as you hear the cold wind blowing across the barren scottish plain , you can feel the chill going right through your bones . finally , i can not leave this review without mentioning the famous scene of the witches . so what do you think polanski's vision of this is ? well , he has not just a few , but three score of witches . i wish he had spent less time trying to shock and more on practice sessions for his actors . it is rated r for graphic violence and full frontal nudity of women and boys . the show would be appropriate for mature teenagers . although it is full of flaws , the movie does have lovely language and effective settings . in the end , i can not recommend it , but i do give it * * which is perhaps a bit more than it deserves . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	screenplay : gary ross . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 122 minutes . in pleasantville u . s . a . , it's always 72 degrees and sunny . the world and its values are completely black-and-white -- particularly white in the case of the population demographics . in pleasantville everything is always perfect , it's always 1958 , and nothing ever changes . the one minor problem with pleasantville is that it doesn't exist , nor has it ever existed . it's the world of an innocuous 1950s family sit-com , played in perpetual reruns on a cable nostalgia network . it's a great high-concept premise which could have worked strictly as a fish-out-of-water comedy . screenwriter gary ross ( big , dave ) continues to show a flair for high concepts with a human touch in his directorial debut , generating laughs from the clash of eisenhower-era and clinton-era mores , as well as from characters awakening to the fact that seeking fulfillment may mean an end to their static bliss . but pleasantville isn't merely a whimsical lark . as he exposes his characters to experiences they'd never even considered , ross turns the film into a pointed examination of what we really mean when we talk about " traditional family values . " pleasantville digs into the barely-concealed anxiety and xenophobia at the heart of so much political retro-think , yet that's not even the film's most daring idea . ross has the guts to take on the notion of original sin itself , suggesting that the very passion and curiosity which lead to upheaval in paradise are also what make us most alive and most human , giving color to an otherwise monochromatic existence . it's unfortunate that ross gets a bit too self-congratulatory about his social satire , particularly in the final half-hour . as tensions build in pleasantville , the battle becomes a clash between those characters still in black-and-white and those whose new , life-changing experiences have left them " colored " -- and that may be the _least_ consistently underlined point . pleasantville is a funny and thoughtful film , the kind that works best before it starts tattooing the moral of the story across your backbrain . it's plenty entertaining just watching the mythology of the " good old days " laid bare , exposed as a comforting fiction far removed from a world where coping with change is more productive than demonizing it . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
1	a delightful screwball comedy , making use of sci-fi gimmicks to bolster its story . willie plays the role with rolling eyeballs and other gestures that smack of a stereotyped racism that is upsetting to many of today's african-americans . when willie sees the invisible man , he exclaims , " well , cut off my legs and call me shorty . " this 72 minute film is the kind of old-fashioned comedy that can cheer you up with a few laughs if you are down , or if you are in a silly mood make you feel even sillier . it's a classic . 
2	movies about mormon missionaries might seem likely to get the same reaction from non-believers . in the case of god's army , viewers who shut the cinematic equivalent of the door in its face will be depriving themselves of a surprisingly good film about faith and dedication . like a high quality blend of a documentary and an after-school television special , this low-budget , fictional film creates a host of interesting characters and provides a lot of surprising background on what it means to be a mormon missionary . although you may have never given them a second thought , they don't have an easy vocation . " isn't it funny how a few short days can change your whole life forever ? " he tells us in voice-over in the opening . ( there are too many references to the wizard of oz in the script , which otherwise , is sharp , intelligent and humorous . ) it's an interesting metaphor and one of many in the thought-provoking script . always polite but not one easy to say " no " to , he has answers for all occasions . " i think that if you're not interested in what we have to say , then you must not know what we have to say , " he tells one person who naively thinks that expressing non-interest will make the missionaries leave . there is certainly one thing that isn't likely to come to mind when people think of mormon missionaries , and that is that they could be big practical jokesters -- not to their would-be converts , but to themselves . in a movie that is frequently quite funny , one of the best scenes has a guy telling elder allen on his first day that he is going to get his gun if they don't leave . the story doesn't skirt difficult issues . the role of women and minorities are discussed as well . the good-spirited and informative picture is well-cast throughout even if the acting is sometimes amateurish . a moving and quite funny film , it isn't at all what you might expect . but be warned : after seeing it you may not be able to quite so efficaciously shoo missionaries from your doorstep . knowing more about them makes them more human and more deserving of basic human politeness . it is rated pg for thematic elements and some language and would be fine for anyone old enough to be interested in the subject matter . 
0	if you like your 007s as dry as a dry martini , this may be the bond for you . the mundane visuals fit right in with the bland storyline . where are the signature chase scenes , the sexual humor and the romantic trysts that we come to bond films for in the first place ? here the chase scenes are mainly saved until the end . dalton's reaction ? the old james sought out such opportunities without being coerced . dalton is dead serious , having little time to waste on women or humor . a white-suited wayne newton , providing some much needed humor , appears in a cameo as a televangelist on the prowl for donations . after a languid and completely formulaic movie , the pace finally picks up at the end in a long chase scene using large gasoline trucks . when the only memorable visual is a semi doing a wheelie , you know the picture is in trouble . it is rated pg-13 for profanity and violence and would be fine for kids around 9 and up . my son jeffrey , age 9 , thought the movie was just okay . he gave it * * and complained that it was too bloody . 
2	message to love : the isle of wight festival , is a new documentary about the festival that works both as a concert film and as a series of mini-dramas . is there going to be a riot ? which drugged-out anarchist from the audience will demand to be heard next ? although both parts of the film are fascinating , i was more energized by the music than interested in the festival's logistics and nightmares . since i was at grad school in berkeley at the time , the music possessed images of dreamy nostalgia for me . although the artists were top-notch , their performances at the isle of wight festival were generally subpar . even if the movie is no woodstock , it still possesses a charm all its own . with performances by the doors , the who , miles davis , donovan , jimi hendrix , kris kristofferson , joni mitchell , and , drum roll , tiny tim , message to love would be a hard film to dislike . although the camera spends too much time concentrating on the performers midriffs and other close-ups , the music's power dominates . the sound track's quality is quite good , which might not be expected given the age of the film stock . director murray lerner's favorite part seems to be the back stage melodrama , which manages to work its way on stage more than once . one drugged-out hippie grabs the microphone to complain that , " this festival business is becoming a psychedelic concentration camp . " lerner manages to find a single individual , " the commodore , " to counterbalance the blather of the festival's fringe elements with his own balderdash . " it is not just hippie fun , " he explains . other than jim hendrix , i did not see a single black at the festival , which made the commodore's charges all the more bizarre . " i'm not going to be forced to give a free concert -- that doesn't make any sense , " complains joni mitchell . most of the audience was so stoned that their thoughts were gibberish .

2	cohen's song will pop up continuously throughout , giving the film an arty flavor to it , as it also adds to the explanation of the film's despondent theme of a small capitalist against the big capitalist . " mccabe & mrs . miller " is an antiwestern western , whose themes of love , gambling , alienation , suffering , death , and capitalism , are as haunting as the cinematography of vilmos zsigmond' beautifully colorful pacific northwest territory is , and as haunting as leonard cohen's ballad is , and as haunting as the moody atmosphere of this winter wonderland of desolation is . the drunken mccabe succeeds by luck : by being at the right spot , at the right time , and not by any skills he might possess . altman's film is strikingly lyrical and perfect in mood ; it is a dreamlike film that is hauntingly memorable , that is magical in scope and sadly touches mccabe's yearnings to find love and a place to put down roots . the result is a poetical western without heroes , that is pathetically witty , where mccabe and mrs . miller's wishful dreams are seen as either foolish romantic notions or drug induced inspirations , ones that never had a chance of coming true .

2	screenplay : christopher guest and eugene levy . director : christopher guest . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 83 minutes . the reason inspired satire is so rare nowadays is that people have been given a warped perception of what satire is . the popular culture -- fed by " saturday night live , " david letterman and even political pundits -- has created the notion that irony , sarcasm and satire are interchangeable , and that there is something inherently hip about ridicule as a spectator sport . but it takes no imagination to savage someone or something you despise ; the best satire in any medium has been born of affection , from people with a gift for pointing out the negative while recognizing the positive . this is spinal tap , the best comedy of the 1980s , was a brilliant satire of the excesses of rock and roll which also respected the commitment of the artists to their work . waiting for guffman , a comedy from tap alum christopher guest , is a more uneven effort , but it is at its funniest skewering small-town america in all its cockeyed optimism . publicity for waiting for guffman is emphasizing the spinal tap connection by describing guest as " the lead guitarist of spinal tap , " but i don't think that comparison does guffman any favors . yes , it is similarly filmed in a faux documentary style , and derives a similar off-beat energy from its largely improvised script . however , there are fewer outrageous high points , largely the result of a less inherently outrageous milieu . the more you expect a middle-american spinal tap , the more time you might spend waiting for the inevitable disasters in the play which turn out to be not so inevitable after all . it may take sitting through all of " red , white and blaine " before it becomes clear that waiting for guffman is not going to be a parade of incompetence , though guest ( who co-wrote the story with co-star levy ) does have fun with the cloistered perspectives of his characters . guest has taken some heat for his swishy portrayal , but i think such criticism misses the point . everyone watching the film understands that corky is supposed to be gay , but no one _in_ the film understands it . gay men simply are not part of their world , so no one thinks twice about why they have never seen corky's " wife " bonnie , or about his exaggerated mannerisms being anything but " theatrical . " the real subject of waiting for guffman , however , isn't merely how narrow the world-view of blaine's residents may be , but how the residents involved in the production respond to a whiff of big city show-biz . you may spend much of waiting for guffman waiting for " red , white and blaine " to be terrible , but it isn't terrible . it is simply ridiculous , of course , that a show like this could ever go to broadway , but the performers are too wonderfully naive to recognize that fact . waiting for guffman is occasionally sluggish through its middle half hour , and hardly the non-stop riot spinal tap was ; it also treats its characters with far more good-humored respect than you might expect . guest understands that it is possible to laugh at people and still love them , and that fine satire can be achieved with the poke of a finger as well as a sledgehammer .

1	and , even though , he is told that the hamam is now out of fashion and the one he has inherited needs lots of repairs , he decides to remain and restore it to its traditional beauty . it was a strange emotional love affair that this film offers its protagonists -- a love affair with a city rather than with another . the film presents a lesson on the old and new cultures of both italy and turkey . but for a film about passion , this one was very reserved , showing no nudity or sensual scenes , in fact very little passion . 
1	this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueff's play " hospitality suite . ''its these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch . their dialogue is acerbic , witty , and analytical . following in the long tradition of salesmen films -- from death of a salesman , the tin men , and glengarry glen ross , as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high . in this case , it is landing the big kahuna . what makes this film different than the others , is its blatant religious message , comparing orthodox religion to what they do , as both must sell their product . he criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burned-out . larry and phil can't fathom how bob didn't make a sales pitch . these three performers were outstanding , each understanding what their role called for , each coming through with a marvelous performance . the only problem with the film , is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience . but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics , give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see . 
2	date released : 11/4/94 ( limited ) running length : 1 : 30 rated : no mpaa rating ( mature themes , violence , language ) consider this situation : two people approach an intersection from different vantage points . neither is lying ; rather , it is the subjective rather than the objective element of their account which is unique to each witness . this sort of difference of perspectives ( albeit in other circumstances ) is one theme explored by writer/director david mamet in oleanna . sexual harassment is certainly an issue of some importance in today's society . while it's easy to attack the issue from an obvious point-of-view ( e . g . , instead , he frames his story around a series of incidents that could be viewed as either completely innocent or not . ultimately , perhaps the question in oleanna is not whether sexual harassment has been committed , but exactly who is persecuting whom . what value is there in a typical college education ? is it more important to go through the expected routines--taking notes , reading texts , and passing exams--than it is to have one's intellect stimulated and one's interests awakened ? as titles go , this one is rather obscure . needless to say , these characters are central to mamet's presentation of certain themes . in some ways , the progression of oleanna is more like that of a psychological thriller than that of a drama . the film spirals in on itself , twisting from sanity and reason to primal emotion . her charges are accurate in fact , but neither intent nor context are considered . as is always the case , mamet's dialogue has a rhythm and cadence all its own . early in the film , this , combined with a sluggish tone , causes oleanna to seem staged and unnatural . later , however , as the pace builds , the strengths of what the actors are saying--and how they're saying it--outstrip the weaknesses . by photographing oleanna using dim lighting frequently designed to hood the eyes , motives , and feelings of the characters , cinematographer andrezej sekula ( reservoir dogs , pulp fiction ) enhances the sense of claustrophobia created by mamet's restrictive setting . by the end of the movie , we in the audience feel as trapped as the characters on screen . oleanna is not a conventionally enjoyable experience , but it isn't intended to be . the film probes deep into some of the darker facets of human interaction , and anything with this keen an edge will cause discomfort . " characteristic " movie-goers are likely to view this as a bad movie ( too slow , too pedantic , too stilted ) . oleanna , however , is no more intended for that crowd than are they for it . this film has been made for those willing to look beneath the surface to see a taut , intellectual sparring match where there is no absolute truth . for these viewers , this picture will leave an indelible imprint . 
0	screenplay : james toback . director : james toback . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , nudity , drug use , violence , adult themes ) running time : 100 minutes . the title of james toback's black and white carries several meanings . it also refers to the dichotomies present in most of the main characters -- between what they have been and what they want to be , between what others expect of them and what they expect of themselves . and , sadly , it also refers to writer/director toback's presentation of his story . there's nary a scrap of subtext to be found in his painfully shallow piece of exploration into a complex cultural phenomenon . black and white winds its way through the intertwined stories of several new yorkers over the space of a few days . there are plenty of characters for toback to keep track of in black and white , but apparently that's not a matter of great concern to him . and it's not surprising , since he hasn't got the slightest interest in developing any of those characters . toback throws out plenty of scenes in which we are supposed to understand what a problem it is when people pretend to be something they're not . the actual people , however , are absurdly static ; there may be one moment in the entire film when we glimpse an emotion that's recognizably human . the stunt casting certainly doesn't help , as houston , power and raekwon do little more than recite lines competently ( mike tyson does do a surprisingly effective job of playing himself , unconcerned about allaying fears that he's a psycho ) . with the notable exception of stiller -- who brings some pitiable self-absorption to his role -- the entire cast of black and white is used by toback as meat puppets to deliver his thoughts on race relations and sexual politics . he might as well have rented a billboard . as cinematic anthropology lessons go , black and white is about as clumsy and uninvolving as you could imagine . every theme is laid out in expository dialogue , crushing the attempt to give the film an improvised urgency . in the first 15 minutes , toback has told you absolutely everything he has to say . if you suspect that might turn the remaining 85 minutes into a pretentious bore , you're right . toback certainly doesn't , or he would have devoted as much energy to giving his characters personalities as he does to giving them speeches and a crossover-ready soundtrack for their lives . by the time black and white's " six months later " coda rolls around -- so abruptly you may be left disoriented by the shift -- you wonder why toback bothers to tie up loose ends at all . his notion of keeping it real means keeping it tedious and pedantic . everything he has to say is up there on the screen in black and white , often underlined just for good measure . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
0	black and white , written and directed by james toback , is for filmgoers who like fast-paced movies that assault their senses with a plethora of stereotypes . most of the blacks in the movie are criminals who appear to have low iqs . neither race comes off very well . given toback's last film , the insufferable two girls and a guy , perhaps one should not be surprised by how atrocious black and white is . a good cast of thousands is wasted in a movie with a script that feels like it was torn apart and reconstructed at random . there are more subplots and characters than you can count . removing the profanity would leave these kids -- black and white -- with almost no dialog save some filler phrases like " what's hapnin' ? " " it's all bs , " says one of the characters . and so is this disgusting and unappealing movie . it is rated r for strong sex scenes , drug usage , massive profanity and violence . the film would not be appropriate for most teens , who will undoubtedly represent 90% of the audience in most theaters . 
2	shown at the philadelphia festival of world cinema running length : 1 : 30 mpaa classification : not rated ( mature themes , sexual situations , profanity ) cast : orvar jens arnarsson , rurik haraldsson , sigrun hjalmtysdottir director : fridrik thor fridriksson screenplay : einar mar gudmundsson cinematography : ari kristinsson no u . s . distribution planned in icelandic with subtitles iceland's motion picture industry may be in its infancy , but fridrik fridriksson's movie days is a very mature effort . the director , who admits that this film is completely autobiographical , said he made the picture to honor his childhood influences and share his impressions on the variety of storytelling methods which led to his becoming involved in film making . elements of cinema paradiso and woody allen's radio days can be seen here , but fridriksson pays homage ; he does not steal . the playful , occasionally-dreamy tone of movie days is all his own . fridriksson loves movies -- that much is clear from the opening moments of this film when he shows his young protagonist , tomas , staring enraptured at a showing of the american biblical saga king of kings . there are other forms of entertainment in 1964 iceland , most notably radio and television , but tomas loves the cinema , whether the offering is a grand epic or a roy rogers flick . in addition to being a fond reminiscence , movie days is also an examination of how american pop culture -- including movies , tv , and music -- wormed its way into the fabric of iceland's society . there , instead of sitting in the darkness staring at a screen filled with wondrous images , he is relegated to lying on his sleeping pallet listening to bedtime stories . nevertheless , tomas comes to enjoy this vastly different life for both its simplicity and its sincerity . movie days does not have an american distributor , nor is it likely to get one . his pictures mix unaffected beauty with freshness and honesty . and what about the image of scandinavian films as slow-moving and deeply- thoughtful ? in fridriksson's own words , " [ingmar] bergman is boring . " this should say just about all that's necessary about the pacing of movie days .

1	kenneth branagh and kevin kline , as the voices of two sixteenth-century conmen from spain , are the comics around whom dreamworks's animated movie , the road to el dorado , is built . upon the shoulders of these wise-cracking characters , who are in just about every scene , rest the success or failure of the movie . once inside the famous city , they are welcomed into a colorful kingdom that looks like a new disneyland attraction -- sorry , dreamworks . for reasons which aren't clear , directors bibo bergeron and will finn are never able to make effective use of their expensive voice talent . only perez's spunky voice is recognizable . the rest sound blandly homogeneous like interchangeable radio newscasters . the lively music for the picture features 6 original songs sung by elton john . the movie's music and visuals easily surpass the story itself , which only works in fits and spurts . one good joke is followed by a half-dozen ones that aren't . the result is a movie that's kind of cute but rarely anything more . the film is rated pg for mild thematic material , brief male nudity and language and would be fine for most kids of any age . my son jeffrey , age 10 , gave the picture * * * , but he complained that the ending was too abrupt . his buddies , nickolas and alan , both 10 , gave the picture * * * 1/2 . all of the boys said that they thought the story was really funny and that their favorite characters were the horse and the monster . 
1	filmmakers seem to think that there's nothing better than a remake with a twist . writer/director greg berlanti's the broken hearts club : a romantic comedy is an amalgamation of dozens of old television sitcoms . the twist , other than raunchier language , is that all of the characters are gay . but the rapid-fire elocution of clich ? d lines isn't any funnier because the barbs are directed at the same sex . rather than treating women as sex objects , the men in this story treat other men as sex objects . uniformly handsome , they can sometimes be hard to tell apart just like contestants at a beauty contest , which is what the movie frequently approximates . " i hate the city -- everybody is better looking than me , " one is heard to say . the film is set in hollywood , well , west hollywood , so one might expect the beauty quotient to be high . in the film's defense , it is good-spirited and breezy . a glossy picture , it wants badly to charm you with its debonair demeanor . most of the guys , however , are more interested in hitting on other guys . it's only 15 . " i was left for a punctuation mark ! " the movie is just like ted ( chris wiehl ) , one of dennis's many lovers . ted is such a forgettable guy that dennis and his friends can't even remember his name , so they just refer to him by his clothes -- j . crew . the film is one big j . crew . the broken hearts club : a romantic comedy runs long even at just 1 : 34 . it is rated r for language , drug use and some sexual content and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
2	it's a curious thing that the best 1995 adaptation of a jane austen book happens to be of her worst novel . sense and sensibility was the author's first published work and , as is often the case with early writing efforts , displays an undeniable shallowness : themes are half- developed , characterization is uneven , and plotting follows a predictable straight-forwardness . austen's later books , including persuasion , which was developed into a wonderfully sumptuous film earlier this year , and emma , which received unusual treatment in clueless , plumb the human soul far more deeply , creating characters and situations of greater versatility and vitality . that's more in the nature of literary criticism than a film review , however . sense and sensibility is a wonderful motion picture , even given the weaknesses of the source material . emma thompson's screenplay has remained faithful to the events and spirit of the book , while somehow managing to plug a few holes and infuse the tale with more light humor than is evident in austen's original text . the resulting product is a little too long ( one-hundred thirty-five minutes ) , but still represents a fine time at the movies , especially for those with a bent towards historical romantic melodramas . as mentioned above , the story isn't all that complex or surprising , and those unfamiliar with austen's work won't be left in the dark . the story of who ends up with whom , and how they get that way , is told with deft skill and a pleasantly humorous romantic touch . as is so often the case in british productions , acting is more important than the script or the impressive production values . emma thompson's elinor can join the actresses' characters from howards end , the remains of the day , and this year's carrington as examples of top- notch , finely-nuanced performances . winslet isn't as accomplished as thompson at capturing the camera's attention , but rarely is she completely eclipsed , either . as expected , the supporting cast is excellent . hugh grant brings his usual boyish charm to edward , and alan rickman ( die hard ) , too often pigeonholed into villainous roles , shows for the first time since truly , madly , deeply that he's very much at home in a romantic part . the novel's flaws guarantee that sense and sensibility cannot be a perfect motion picture , but it would be difficult , i think , to do much better with the material than emma thompson and director ang lee ( eat drink man woman ) have here . with more jane austen on the way ( versions of pride and prejudice and emma ) , it's still too early to say which adaptation will stand out as the best , but sense and sensibility makes a strong case . 
0	i like steve buscemi . i really do , which is why it's such an disagreeable task to write a review that condemns his directorial debut as a waste of film . i'm not talking about a good idea gone awry , i'm referring to something that's rotten to the core . if i hadn't been preparing to write a review , i would have walked out on this one . it's a pointless , lackluster , unpleasant character study of a bunch of pointless , lackluster , unpleasant people who sit around a bar all day . imagine cheers with all the comedy and life drained away and you'll have an idea what trees lounge is like . trees lounge , despite its nods to john cassavetes , is stillborn . supporters of this film will undoubtedly claim that it's an examination of a middle-aged man going nowhere -- a portrait of the wasted life of a rootless individual . i can't argue with that , but i'm not sure what the point is of putting the audience through such a shallow and tiresome account . it's not interesting . it's not entertaining . there are some attempts at humor , but , for the most part , they don't work . it's one thing to have a slow moving story with a compelling character . it's quite another to have the situation that exists here : a nonexistent plot about a man who means nothing to us . and so it goes=85 for a few minutes , just past the midpoint , the movie turns interesting . she's the only worthwhile character in this whole mess , but her predictable relationship with tommy is never well-developed , and we're left wondering whether they slept together or just " made out like a couple of teenagers " . the resolution of this situation , like almost everything else in trees lounge , is dissatisfying . if you want to see a thoughtful examination of an older man/young girl relationship , check out dennis hopper and amy locane in carried away . that film shows how clumsily buscemi handles similar material . there's more that i could say about trees lounge , but my words would be nasty and repetitious , so why bother ? as it is , i've wasted more time and ink on the movie than it's worth . i hate to be so negative , but better luck next time , steve . this one's a real dud . -- ingmar bergman 
2	i have heard their decisions to pledge defended with terms like " service , " " networking , " or " fellowship . " however , the most brutally honest explanation i've ever heard comes from one unnamed student in the sundance grand prize winning documentary frat house : " it's about finding the people you enjoy getting f * * * * * d up with most . " it aroused my interest enough that i was disappointed to find that issue unexplored , but ultimately todd phillips and andrew gurland's goal was to show _what_ people join when they join fraternities and sororities . however , though their footage of hazing , strippers , binge-drinking and humiliation has " expose' " written all over it , i'd be lying if i said i was surprised by anything i saw in frat house . i saw enough in my own college days to reach the point where nothing a drunken , misogynistic 19-year-old does or says will shock me . what _is_ shocking and surprising is the fact that phillips and gurland were able to capture this behavior on film . while frat house is certainly a testemonial to male bonding at its ugliest , it may be even more effective as a testemonial to the determination of the film-makers . there was one other condition as well : the film-makers themselves would be obliged to go through everything the pledges went through . never has the pain of creating a film gelled as smoothly with the subject of the film itself . it doesn't do justice to the quality of frat house as a piece of film-making to focus entirely on the hard work of phillips and gurland . their instincts for making their subject entertaining are impressive , notably in a hilarious juxtaposition of one sorority's " hell night " ( composed primarily of sobbing through a lyrically-amended version of " through the years " ) with the fraternal equivalent . frat house is worth watching not just because the subject matter is sensational , though that may draw some concerned parents . its real achievement is creating a record of the kind of ridiculous , frightening and grimly hysterical behavior everyone already knows goes on college campuses across the country ; it's the realest " real world " episode you'll ever see . credit phillips and gurland with going the extra mile to show that reality to the world . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
1	another feel good type foreign movie , ala the full monty , that seems to please the audience , drawing in enough crowds to turn a nifty profit for its independent producers , and is good enough so that the critics are very generous in their praises , playing down the film's bland politics . a quaint irish village , replete with ordinary type of folks as eccentrics , a clever little plot with a few surprises thrown in for down the road , a bunch of likable locals , colorful scenery , wonderful irish pipes heard in the background , and it all adds up to a gentle and charming little film , with no deep messages or symbolism attached to it . the only serious flaw in the film , is a contrived phone booth scene towards the end of the movie . that scene absolves the film from dealing with any bigger moral questions it might have raised , by getting rid of the fly in the ointment , the one character in the village that upset its tranquility . they gave the film a rich quality that goes beyond the story line and the moral implications of the scam that they perpetrated . and , of course , there is a wee bit of gossip in the air . the twist in the story is interesting , and if you have not seen the film and do not want to know this twist , please skip the following paragraph and go directly to my grade rating of the movie . now tell me , how many films have you seen lately that can get away with such a corny but happy ending and still be critically well-thought of ? review on 2/27/99

2	" is it ever too late to do the right thing ? " she underplays the role , which contributes to the film's palatability . rob reiner's direction gives the movie the same smooth tone of his last film , the american president . ghosts of mississippi is quite a funny film , but it should have been more disturbing . reiner concentrates on making the film easy to accept . only woods understands what should be the purpose of the picture which is to make us angry at beckwith and at the system of discrimination and hatred that he represents . the film is baldwin's . he has the vast majority of the screen time , and the script by lewis colick has the case revolving around him -- will the prosecutor find the evidence , how will he handle the trial , and so on . his performance is earnest and solid . there is nothing to fault and little to praise . other than the oscar worthy role by woods , the supporting cast is the best part of the film . his lines keep the audience laughing . the movie is slowly paced , and material could have easily been cut so that we could have learned something of medgar , the man . ghosts of mississippi is feel good movie about catching the bad guy . i would rather have been more challenged and outraged . reiner makes it all too simple and straight-forward . luckily woods , with a relatively modest number of lines , is there to remind us of how diabolical were the man and his deeds . his acting , together with a strong supporting cast , makes for a good film . it could and should have been a great one . it is rated r for some profanity , a realistic shooting , and mature themes . there is no sex or nudity . the film would be fine for any teenager , and i hope many will see the picture . i recommend the film to you and give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	think of him as the darth vader of directors , and yet , his work is frequently brilliant . his the age of innocence was my second favorite movie of 1993 . scorsese has a talent of which most directors can only dream . like the fbi warnings on the front of video tapes , let me warn all viewers who are incapable or unwilling to see movies with extremely graphic and arguably gratuitously violent scenes , you should pass on this movie . feel free to read the review of course . i will cover the gory aspects at the end when i discuss its ridiculous mere r rating . this means the audience hasn't a clue as to how true or realistic any of this is . i bought some parts , but doubted others . the degree of reality was not a big issue for me in this picture . it turns out all you had to do then to work in a casino was apply for a license , actually getting one was unnecessary . it took ten years to process the application , and so long as you change titles every few years , your application would go to the back to the bottom of the stack thus ensuring that any unsavory past and any mob connections are never discovered . i collected tons of fun trivia about how pit bosses work , how card cheating schemes are detected , etc . to further complicate this picture , we have sharon stone as ginger mckenna . actually most of the movie is told in narration that is periodically interrupted to let the whole cast get a chance to speak . in one scene the action freezes while the actor tells why he is going to chose to say what does . i found this extreme narration approach intriguing , but ultimate tiring . in fact , one of the chief problems with casino is that at about three hours long , it overstays its welcome . the best parts of the movie are the costumes by john dunn ii and rita ryack . ace wears one iridescent suit after another - orange , peach , lime green , cranberry red , salmon , chartreuse , you name it , but always with a contrasting solid colored shirt and tie . to complement this , the violent nicky sticks to dull grays and black outfits with little character . i think the costume designers are a shoe-in at award time . i believe they must have used crazy glue to attach a cigarette to ace's hand since he has one in every scene in the movie . the sets by dante ferretti are fun too - full of solid gold rather than pink flamingos as well as other tributes to the bad guys' bad taste . there is no bad acting in casino . stone plays the most complex role of her career and amazingly is pretty good at it , but i still liked her best in basic instinct . most of her movies have been terrible , but she does have talent in addition to good looks . deniro is one of the best actors alive today , but i found ace to be of his least interesting roles . i got tired of ace after a while . woods has a small but well done role as a wasted loser . pesci was a little too out of control for my taste , but it was a good piece of acting . bad guys will yank pencils out of people's hands and stab them in the throat . you have to endure seeing a man's hand being smashed with a hammer and the sounds of the bones being broken as the bloods gushes out . in the most disturbing of all of the images , men are killed with baseball bats with the sound of large bones snapping and blood flowing everywhere , and then you get to see them buried alive . you can handle that ? great , you are certified to see this film . whether you want to or not of course is another matter . i found myself watching my back in the parking lot when i left the theater ; i had lost a little trust in my fellow man . casino runs a little under three hours , but your seat will feel like it is at least five due to the plodding pace by editor thelma schoonmaker . the movie is rated r by the mpaa which is is a travesty . this movies is clearly nc-17 . i do not think is appropriate for teenagers . actually , with much tighter editing , say an hour less movie and even if they left in all of the gore , i could recommend this movie to adult audiences with strong stomachs . as released , i give it a mild thumbs down and award it * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : december 4 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	praise for the indian director , who died in 1992 shortly after receiving a lifetime achievement oscar , has been effusive from both film makers and critics . and james ivory , the director of howards end and the remains of the day , has said that , after watching a ray movie , the viewer will feel " fulfilled , enriched , maybe wiser , and wanting more . " indeed , it is ivory , along with his partner , ismail merchant , who has made this screening of pather panchali , ray's directorial debut , possible . the movies , which exist on video but are not readily available , are worth searching out . anyone who believes in the uplifting power of motion pictures will not be disappointed . ray takes the time to create a meticulously believable world that draws the viewer in . there isn't a false note in the entire film -- not in the characterization , the dialogue , or the storyline . the emotions evoked by the events of pather panchali are honest and true , not the contrived byproducts of manipulative formulas . ray makes us feel with the characters , not just for them . most of what transpires is shown through the eyes of either sarbojaya or durga , and , as a result , we identify most closely with these two . harihar is absent for more than half of the movie , and , before the penultimate scene , abu is a mere witness to events , rather than a participant . until the closing moments , we don't get a sense of the young boy as a fully formed individual , since he's always in someone else's shadow . with its often-poetic black-and-white images and heartfelt method of storytelling , pather panchali speaks intimately to each member of the audience . this tale , as crafted by ray , touches the souls and minds of viewers , transcending cultural and linguistic barriers . the languorous pace , which initially seems detrimental , proves to be an asset -- pather panchali would not have been the same experience had material been cut . this is the kind of motion picture that will stay with you for hours , or perhaps even days , after you've left the theater , and that's a rare characteristic for any movie . 
2	with a relaxed pace and lyrical visual style , this motion picture , which explores issues of spirituality and guilt , will never find an audience among mainstream movie-goers . nevertheless , for those who appreciate perceptive , offbeat , experimental features , angela offers a rewarding one-hundred minutes . sometimes , she's sweet and joyful ; on other occasions , she's violent and self-destructive . in her metaphysical vision , the world is a place of angels -- both good and bad -- and the difference between going to heaven or hell depends on whether you can differentiate between the two . she sees reality through naive eyes , and miller ( who wrote the screenplay in addition to handling the directorial chores ) does a superlative job of presenting this story from the child's viewpoint while still making it clear what the more objective , " adult " perspective of events is . miranda stuart ryne , a young actress of astounding ability , was chosen for the title role from a field of more than 1000 hopefuls . viewing her nearly-flawless performance , it's easy to understand why miller cast her . for someone of her age , she has amazing screen presence , and makes acting appear effortless . the impish charlotte blythe , although not as effective as her older co-star , is entirely believable . when we're children , we attribute more power to ourselves than we actually have . that's the quality of youth that angela most perfectly captures . not since last year's obscure polish feature , crows , has there been a more apt exploration of how children relate to their setting . the film builds slowly , but inevitably , towards a conclusion that is at once powerful , shocking , and moving . in some ways , angela can be seen as a cautionary tale about the dangers of taking a particular dogma to an extreme , but , mostly , the movie reminds us of the complexity of life from the child's point-of-view , something it's easy to forget once we cross the invisible boundary of adulthood . 
1	a mixture of humor and pathos , the film has some memorable moments but overall comes across surprisingly flat . based on billie letts's book , the uneven script is by the writing team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandel , who have produced some wonderfully funny comedies ( city slickers ) as well as some gratingly awful ones ( father's day ) . if the story sounds funny , it is sometimes , but you're more likely to grin than laugh . much of the movie tests the film's pg-13 rating . maybe this doesn't make the film r by the mpaa rating standards , but it's a lot more shocking than many r films , which get the rating because some character says the f-word a couple of times . a sad story , where the heart is never quite finds its rhythm , which leaves its audience fidgeting in their seats not quite knowing whether to laugh or cry . the story does have a lot of potential . one suspects that with a script doctor and a seasoned director , the film could have soared . as released , it's a film with an almost equal balance of hits and misses , but with a precious performance by portman at its core . it is rated pg-13 for intense thematic material , language and sexual content and would be acceptable for those over 13 . 
2	this certainly isn't the first motion picture to focus on father/daughter bonding , nor will it be the last . but i'll do anything has the distinction of being enjoyable and entertaining , while bringing a new twist or two to an old subject . not everything works out quite as expected , and that's the biggest element of the movie's charm , because these days it's usually too easy to predict what's coming next . kids in movies generally come in one of two categories : sickeningly cute or terminally annoying . there are a few scenes where she fails to convince , but far more in which she's entirely believable . if ms . wright avoids the " culkin syndrome " , she could have a bright future . as always , nick nolte is the consummate professional , and his supporting cast is equally solid . this isn't a unique role , but mr . brooks acts the part with gusto . i'll do anything is blessed with a wonderful screenplay that shares equal parts drama and comedy . the emotional texture is surprisingly firm , especially as it relates to matt and jeannie , but there are plenty of laughs to be had . much of the script works because it rarely strays from the commonplace . since the audience can therefore relate to the characters and their situations , the movie has an impact . those scenes that go over-the-top , such as the incident with jeannie running around screaming on an airplane , come across as silly and unnecessary . i'll do anything presents similar themes to those developed in , among other projects , the player , the big picture , and mistress . the satire isn't as biting because the overall intention is to create a human interest story rather than a cynical look at a jaded industry ripe for parody . movies about parent/child relationships are usually riddled with formulas . however , while james brooks' project occasionally allows a too-pat resolution to slip by , there are a few minor surprises . i'll do anything can justifiably boast a freshness and intelligence too often absent from motion pictures . just take a look at my father the hero for an example of how a film can take a similar idea and completely botch it . the greatest strength of i'll do anything isn't difficult to pinpoint--it has immense appeal . not only is the movie well-scripted and competently-acted , but it presents its characters in such a way that the audience can feel for them without being aware of overt manipulation . mr . brooks , the director of such films as broadcast news and terms of endearment , has delivered a rare jewel in the bleakness of february's movie wasteland . i'll do anything may have started out life as a failed musical , but with judicious edits and re-shoots , it has become a thoroughly enjoyable dramatic comedy . 
1	producers : mark canton and irving azoff . director : troy miller . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , mild vulgar innuendo ) running time : 95 minutes . at the half-hour mark of the family fantasy jack frost , the titular character has not yet been reborn as a walking , talking snowman a year after his death thanks to a magic harmonica tune . it's cute , yet utterly weightless . there are worse things , i suppose , than a harmless bit of family shmaltz for the holiday season . keaton is engaging enough as the hustling , slightly immature human jack , goofing with charlie in a way that suggests he's more interested in being a playmate than being a father . there's at least one very lively chase sequence which will charm the young ones , as well as a welcome paucity of inappropriately sniggering content . and it's true that the snowman ( courtesy jim henson's creature shop ) is a nifty creation , just the right combination of classic look and human expressiveness . there are enough giggles and guffaws in jack frost to make it fun for youngsters without either embarrassing parents or boring them entirely to sleep . what makes it hard to swallow is that it's utterly inconsequential while pretending to be both hipper and more emotional than it really is . 'cause if it is , that's not even very clever . " yet despite attempts to show that the film is a bit above its cutesy premise , it's rarely anything more than a syrupy trifle , sentimental without being resonant ( from a story by mark steven johnson , who made the sentimental , resonance-free simon birch ) . one could argue that jack frost isn't really about jack at all , but about charlie ( a generally understated performance by joseph cross ) , in need of closure after the loss of a father he barely knew . even that take on the story doesn't give it any added pull , not when the script keeps adding simplistic touches like a bully who abruptly drops his bullying and helps charlie because he too understands what it's like to be without a dad . eventually it's hard to identify any significant story at all as jack frost becomes more derivative and rushed towards its climax , complete with a final vision of the human jack so reminiscent of ghost i expected " unchained melody " to burst out on the soundtrack . jack frost isn't so much a story as it is a diverting bit of special effects silliness leading up to a sob cue . it taught me something important about what really matters in a film script : a character arc for the protagonist that's not complete before the first plot point . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
0	it succeeds mostly in being a visceral experience and for those who like to see brad pitt' pecs and how edward norton squirms when beaten up , and be bemused to hear helena bonham carter complain that the boys sure love their violence more than they do sex . the film eventually knocks itself out from hitting itself so much in the " old " noggin without really damaging its unspecified opponent-- society as a whole . the sheer nonsense of its storyline causes that knockout by relying on a ridiculous metaphor to make its point , too much glitter , and pitt' and norton' overacting ; what results is a jarring experience , enough to make you think without thinking that being sado-masochistic is the way to achieve respect ( it doesn't matter if this is meant to be a parody reflecting the violence in america : the violence is the thing in this story that the audience will remember most about this film ) . it succeeds in this venture only as a disturbing film , which makes the provocative assertion that those who are self-absorbed and mindless and go over-the-edge by doing violent acts are supposedly looking for hidden meanings in their life , which are given to them by false prophets , something that is happening currently in america to a great extent . but this film is too stilted , unconvincing , and inane to be the messenger delivering a warning about such dangers in society . but if its comedy that it is after , then it has some success in meeting those expectations , as the stars were able to project themselves into this story with enough animation to give the film a titillating lift . the more we get to know about the engaging soap salesman who is selling not only soap but a nihilistic philosophy , the more we learn how depraved he is . human lives are not part of this equation . a homo-erotic edge to their relationship is also hinted at , but like everything in this film , it is only superficially covered . the narrator suffers from insomnia , probably caused by his non-meaningful life . the utterly depraved tyler , exhibiting the ability to be a leader , with a need to offer sanctimonious maxims against the emptiness of materialism , such as , " you are not your job , " and the irresolute narrator , who is someone crying out for help and who is also someone ripe for being brainwashed . that all this is supposed to be funny is a matter of taste , though i think it is funny in a juvenile sort of way , where bad taste rules the day . the humor is catered to those who like their laughs coming to them shock treatment style . their alienation from society , supposedly , relates to those in the audience who also feel powerless about all the violence taking place in the country and now will have been amply warned by the filmmaker not to follow charismatic leaders and join cults that offer easy solutions to their problems , which should give the film a conventional reason for being made . the problem with the film's message , is that it comes via a film that is relying on the excesses of violence to put over its exploitive story , and then , to have this filmmaker be the voice of reason , is almost enough to make the average citizen who is concerned about the recent shootings in america's schools and the other sensational newsworthy violent acts , wonder what to make of this film , or to just barf at this outlandishly childish attempt to answer some very serious problems in such a mindlessly simple way . the fatuous simplicity the film offers for linking america's penchant for violence and sex , with the peoples' lack of fulfillment from meaningful jobs , is too much of a generality to be taken seriously . this response to what has gone wrong with the american dream is just as banal and wrong-headed a response , as those who would blame films such as this one for america's problems . at some point in the film , probably as soon as the fight club was started by tyler teaching the nerd how to fight and the club was then expanded into franchises across the country and evolved into a secret society of mayhem , the film stopped being smart and turned into a pointless nonsensical venture , that is not serious enough to take seriously , except it should be complimented for its imaginative visual style and kinetic energy it shows . the film's undercurrent philosophical sub theme stated by tyler , that " it's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything , " is an alluring one . if that were developed further along in the storyline , then there would be some intellectual challenges to a film that tries very hard to be nihilistic but fails miserably to make a cogent case for that belief or whatever it is trying to say , such as the drivel about this being a film about freeing the masculine soul from the shackles of a consumer society . i didn't fall under brad pitt' spell as easily as edward norton and helena bonham carter did , and therefore was not in a receptive mood for how the film was finally resolved . for me , this was a lightweight film that mistakingly thinks it's in the heavyweight class . what it offers for philosophy , is similar to the kind of superficial sound bites the tv news might offer to comment on its headline stories , as the news people seem to always play it safe and never take a radical position on the events they cover . what the film offers as philosophy is pseudo-philosophy , for a story that is more steeped in violence than interested in understanding its ramifications in a consumer society . it is just too easy to be against the fascists and the yuppies , and the emptiness of their materialistic lives . exploring that avenue , and not getting bogged down in showing another escapist violent film , might have been a more radical route to have gone down . it was very hard for me to see this unconventional mainstream film as anything more than a film that showed promise and had a lot of zip to it , but was disappointing in its scope . . . and . . . was certainly not a radical film .

2	starring : robin williams , sally field , pierce brosnan , harvey fierstein . screenplay : randi mayem singer & leslie dixon . director : chris columbus . i've never been a member of the robin williams fan club . a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i'm watching a 40-year-old class clown . in his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances . doubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams' best comic screen project yet . while it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs . doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy . mrs . doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so . the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that's instantly believable . it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman's dorothy michaels look like milton berle . more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it's a bit hard to swallow that she doesn't recognize any of the voices as her husband's . perhaps the biggest contrivance we're asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . doubtfire in a few minutes . there's more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask . fortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll . during the film , i was generally too busy laughing . after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams' riffing , mrs . daniel's frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away . clearly , most of the credit for doubtfire's success goes to robin williams . it took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn't just robin williams with a different name . he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed . his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity . it's one of mrs . doubtfire's charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better . as miranda , sally field is solid in a background role , and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu . the children are also good , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest . the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing . it's easy to see mrs . doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it's true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common . doubtfire manages to carve out its own space , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge's decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda's relationship . doubtfire , but there are plenty of laughs , and good comedies are always in short supply . and it's nice to see robin williams just act for a change .

1	zero effect is a perfect example of how the medium in which a story is told can affect one's opinion of it . as a made-for-tv movie/series pilot , zero effect would hold a great deal of promise : it introduces offbeat characters like daryl zero ( bill pullman ) and steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , who , over time , might become viewer favorites . and the premise -- a modern-day sherlock holmes -- while not tremendously original , has at least as much promise as columbo . but there's a problem : zero effect is not intended as the forerunner of a weekly television program ; it's designed as a theatrical motion picture , and , in that category , it turns out to be disappointingly ordinary . just in case there's any confusion , let me state at the outset that there's no doubt that writer/director jake kasdan ( son of lawrence ) intended this to be an homage to ( that sounds so much nicer than " rip off of " ) sir arthur conan doyle's famous fictitious detective . and kasdan has lifted elements from doyle's " a scandal in bohemia . " that said , zero effect isn't a direct re-writing of " a scandal in bohemia " -- the details are different . for a mystery , the plot is suitably convoluted , and there are a few surprise twists ( most of which can be guessed by a seasoned fan of the genre -- the script is competent , but not excessively clever ) . it's a role that pullman pulls off with aplomb . not surprisingly , some of the funniest moments of the film involve stiller , but the actor and his character all-but-vanish after the film's first half-hour . the casting flaw is kim dickens , who fails to imbue gloria with much life or passion . worse still , her interaction with zero doesn't generate more than a few fitful sparks . as essayed by dickens , this woman hardly seems like the type who would interfere with the world's greatest private investigator's practice of the " fine art of detachment . " for its first thirty minutes , zero effect is actually quite enjoyable -- it's funny , off-beat , and fresh . the script has some moments of near brilliance ( consider the security measures arlo has to go through to gain entrance to his boss' abode ) , and , for a while , zero effect looks like it could be headed in the direction of a satire . however , time proves this not to be the case and , as the plot moves more into the arena of the traditional mystery , the proceedings drift into an auto-pilot mode with generic story elements and predictable plot twists . ultimately , the film seems like it's about fifteen minutes too long , and there are enough scenes that don't work that it's not hard to pick out candidates for deletion . kasdan maintains a light tone throughout , which is fortunate , since it prevents the movie from sinking into ponderousness . zero effect is a mixed bag , and it's sure to look a lot better when it eventually reaches hbo than it does playing on the big screen at the local multiplex . - ingmar bergman 
2	it's a fairly well-known fact that the indian film industry is the most active in the world , producing more movies each year than any other ( including hollywood ) . few of those films , however , reach screens beyond their domestic market . largely because of their limited north american appeal and dubious quality , indian movies are routinely ignored by distributors . there are exceptions , of course -- the work of satyajit ray and last year's bandit queen , for example . occasionally , however , a worthwhile picture causes enough people to take notice that it becomes a favorite on the international film festival circuit . one such movie is bombay , the fourteenth feature from celebrated director mani rathnam . in many ways , bombay is deceptive , but the manner in which it deceives the audience adds to its eventual impact . for the first hour , it's a relatively-lighthearted romantic musical . but shekhar and bano's love will not be denied . rehman , set the film's initial tone , which is one of soaring joy and passion . and , while the music isn't exactly of the toe-tapping variety , it's stronger and more memorable than most songs in american movies over the past year or two . just when you're starting to feel comfortable with bombay , everything changes -- and the unexpected shift in tone hits like a punch to the gut . gone is the fun and frivolity , as death and violence suddenly fill up the screen . now we understand the full extent of rothnam's purpose in the first half -- he was setting us up to like these characters so that when tragedy strikes , we can feel the pain and hopelessness of their situation . it's melodramatic and manipulative , to be sure , but it works . bombay's second half takes place during this time period . cinematographer rajiv menon captures the chaos of the riots . it's grim and terrifying , and , at times , difficult to watch . bombay is a gripping indictment of racial hatred . shekhar's cry that " we are all indians first of all ! " isn't heeded . the only response is echoed many times over : " the divide will never heal . " bombay ends on a hopeful note , but not before etching a series of wrenching images in the minds of viewers . bombay recalls how forceful a motion picture can be . it also reminds us of the maxim that those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it . hopefully , some day , humankind will understand the lesson that rathnam is teaching here . 
2	john alton is an excellent cinematographer , with noir films being his specialty , as his camera knows how to capture that shadowy world of half-lit images and dark background scenery . his camera work adds the extra-element of suspense and by using many different and odd camera angles he makes things seem unbalanced , something that works rather well for this nightmarish tale . in this film , the director and the cinematographer are fortunate to have a tight , tough , no-nonsense script to work with and they make the best of it , touching a raw nerve or two , as the film is fast-paced and packed with scenes that are shockingly brutal . this film is one of the best kept noir secrets , as it is not mentioned enough when powerful noir films are discussed by aficionados of the genre . this is usually the man's role in such films . we have witnessed a special poetic moment in noir film , a shot that has since become a classic , telling more in its noir imagery than words could ever express . this was the weakest scene in the movie . it seemed too contrived , as the killer's wild comment to them was , " i killed her but i don't know why ; i deserve to die . " but it , somehow , sounds to her , that he is saying it to ann not her . the photography is electric , consisting of low angle shots and reflections of light coming in from the open window , giving the scene a naturally eerie look and a depth perception creating the illusion of how far apart the men have now become in their lives , as the light from the candelabra highlights the shadows in the room . this fatalistic drama ends in total violence , with no winners . it's a sad reminder of burning desires and romantic dreams going up in flames . claire's voiceover narration gives the film some added chills , and the three main characters become studies in emotional deprivation , giving the film an added depth in its character study . the acting was first-rate . the look of the film was beyond reasonable expectations of how good a noir film should look . the sexual tension was penetrating . this was , to say the very least , an interesting work . 
2	trick is one of those rare gay romantic comedies that passes the " straight test . " filmmakers appeared to think that the mere act of putting a same-sex couple on the screen made the film praise-worthy , often failing to introduce much that was entertaining on its own merits . thus was born my " straight test , " which allowed for a fairly quick barometer of quality : would anyone pay the slightest attention to the same story if the two principal characters were a man and a woman ? jim fall's bright , fun , frisky comedy not only passes the " straight test , " it makes plenty of straight romantic comedies look positively inept by comparison . as the evening progresses , and gabriel and mark get better acquainted , simple sex begins to seem less interesting -- though also less complicated -- than the prospect of a more serious relationship . trick's single-day structure may be something of a trick in itself , yet there's rarely a moment when jason schafer's screenplay feels forced or contrived . sure , it falls back on humor from drag queens and cabaret performances . in fact , as pure comedy , trick rarely stumbles . every character gets wonderful moments , sparked by the kind of dialogue woody allen used to produce in his prime . even tori spelling -- yes , i said tori spelling -- is a revelation as the blissfully self-absorbed katherine , particularly throwing her " talents " behind a performance of gabriel's composition " enter you . " when a director can turn spelling into a gifted comic actress , you know he's a talent to watch for . i suppose the reason trick is even more appealing than its laugh value is that it does more with a gay relationship than any film i can remember . that's probably because it isn't _just_ about a gay relationship . the developing relationshp between gabriel and mark works the way all good romantic relationships work , exploring the way people discover surprisingly wonderful things about each other when they least expect it . the fact that the relationship develops in the midst of such entertaining comedy is a delightful bonus . the obstacles thrown in their way do begin to feel a bit contrived , but you may be having too much fun to notice . trick is so effortlessly charming , i may just change the name of the " straight test " to the " trick test .

1	an invigorating charlie chan escapade and the best one in the series , featuring sidney toler as chan . the film reaches its climax after several plot twists when there's a challenge between rhadini and zodiac , which charlie asks lewis's paper to sponsor . this wasn't a tough one to figure out who did it , but the story was a seamless one . it was a fun film , and one also got a chance to see the san francisco version of the 1939 world's fair . 
1	mad city is one of innumerable motion pictures that gets derailed on the long track from premise to realization . the semi-serious film , which stars high-profile actors dustin hoffman and john travolta , and is directed by costa-gavras ( betrayed ) , becomes the latest in the recent flurry of movies to make a statement about the growing lack of ethics in broadcast journalism . it's all ratings and entertainment value , not integrity ! unlike some of the more worthy contenders , mad city fails to bring anything new to the table . every aspect of this movie has been presented before in a better film with a more involving setup . if you've seen network , to die for , welcome to sarajevo , and especially billy wilder's 1951 biting satire , the big carnival ( aka ace in the hole ) , mad city will seem like a tired retread . the absence of originality and inspiration isn't mad city's only problem -- it also suffers from a shocking lack of subtlety . the film's goal of skewering the media is pursued with such single-mindedness that nearly every supporting character is reduced to a familiar type : the empty-headed local news personality , the arrogant network anchor , the innocent camera person seduced by fame and fortune , and the old- fashioned news director who looks on sadly as the story is manipulated . even john travolta's sam baily isn't all that interesting -- he's basically a dumb lug who lets circumstances get away from him . mad city says everything it wants to say in its first forty-five minutes . after that , it spins its wheels for over an hour , waiting for the inevitable conclusion . despite costa-gavras' best manipulative efforts , sam never captures our sympathy . worse still , he's a static personality with no dramatic arc . he's the same at the end as at the beginning , and it's difficult for an audience to connect with an individual who exhibits no growth . travolta does an adequate job in this role , but he doesn't have a character of substance to work with . hoffman , who previously played the less jaded but equally energetic bernstein in all the president's men , is excellent as max , mad city's dubious moral compass . but , although hoffman gives max flair , there's little that he can do to correct the overlong and derivative script . none of the supporting actors really stands out with the possible exception of alan alda , who does a credible imitation of a snake in the grass . mad city's overall picture of the media is decidedly unflattering . the movie is also awash in subplots , none of which amount to much . in fact , they seem like filler to pad the movie out to its nearly two hour length . for a film that covers so much material , mad city seems surprisingly drawn out , but the reason is that it fails to do much of anything well . the satire isn't sharp and the drama isn't effective . watching mad city , i felt much the same way that i did 5 years ago while sitting through hoffman's hero -- great idea , poor execution . mad city doesn't work because it's an exercise in themes and ideas that never gels into a compelling story . " for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake . " 
1	interrupted by regular spurts of video-game shoot-'em-ups , the uneven film generally drags along as if it were trying to approximate slow motion without actually resorting to modifying the speed . an ambitious movie with a dense storyline of competing characters who have complicated allegiances , it promises more than it delivers . the setup and the action sequences are imaginative , but , overall , first-time director christopher mcquarrie shows more skills as a writer than a director . key sections of the movie sag when they should sizzle . others sizzle but are allowed to overcook . the frequent stupidity of the kidnappers is a plot thread that never really pays off , save providing fodder for one of the film's best lines . " is he the brains of the outfit or you ? " " to tell the truth , i don't think this is a brains kind of outfit , " confesses longbaugh . in general the story's tone is deadly serious , which is underscored by sober music , heavy on the low registers . the few comic lines are welcome changes of pace . the resulting action is surprising and hilarious . and , like the rest of the film , very gory . mcquarrie seems to pride himself on devising new ways to make the audience squirm . but even with its many problems , way of the gun isn't a bad film . the story is intriguing , and we are never quite sure what will happen next . mcquarrie does a masterful job of creating an unusual mood and atmosphere for the movie . the actor's performances are all good in revealing so little of their unsympathetic characters that we want to know exactly what they are thinking . after about an hour or so , we are more than ready to bid our players goodbye . the concluding part , when it finally arrives , feels like it will never end . we want everyone to die in the final bloodbath so we can finally get the movie over -- its intrigue having long-since given way to tedium . 
2	he was just twenty-nine years- old and had made two brilliant feature films , zero conduct and this film . l'atalante is , perhaps , considered by some , a dated film as far as its style goes . but with that being said , there is no denying that it is still powerful viewing because of its magically developed poetical gestures to the subject of love and the refreshingly lyrical way it looks out at its surrounding seascape towns and at the human condition . the ordinary couple are playing out their vexing emotions without letting on how much these emotions mean to them , until it is almost too late . because their emotions and passions are so dominating , the quality of the film engulfs everyone aboard the barge in an unreal state . the seine looks so much like a dreamworld , where those on it are just drifting . because the story is such a simple one and the couple in so ordinary , it is not the story in itself that is exhilerating , as much as the way the film moves us to look at our own lives , with all its possibilities and disappointments . it makes us see things in a way that is disarmingly enchanting . that despite the moroseness and daily grind of regular life , there is also a poetical and romantic mood , waiting to be tapped . we makes his film an out-of-this world cinematic experience that sublimely lingers in our consciousness . the film version to see , which is now on video , is the restored 1990 one , that pierre philippe and jean-louis bompoint recovered missing footage for . the film is now more decipherable from the botched up initial showing of the film , that was not well received by the paris audience . it is good to see vigo's almost original version of the film resurrected , at last , and look so stunningly beautiful in black-and-white . 
0	nothing is sadder than seeing a once-beloved movie series keep churning out sequels long after its time is past . three more sellers' panther movies subsequently were released ( the return of the pink panther , the pink panther strikes back , and the revenge of the pink panther ) , none as good as the first two , but all worthwhile diversions . unfortunately , sellers' death in 1980 failed to stem the tide of the films which , at that point , should have been ended . the trail of the pink panther and the curse of the pink panther were produced , neither of which was worth the price of admission . benigni , star of the farce johnny stecchino , is adept when it comes to physical humor , and his abilities are highlighted here in four or five scenes that include heavy doses of slapstick . however , while these produce some laughter , they are largely regurgitations of material from previous pink panther entries . beyond copying peter sellers' style , benigni has little to do , and less by which to distinguish himself . i guess the years have taken away his edge . once , we demanded superlative films from him ; now , we're just hoping for something somewhat entertaining . the opening titles are as uninspired as those for any of the pink panthers . although they give the big cat his first opportunity to mix with live actors , the interaction is stale and fails to stir a chuckle . it's sad , because i always considered the pink panther to be one of the funnier cartoon characters , both on his own and introducing the clouseau movies . not only is the animated panther not up to snuff , but the opening theme is sub-par as well . at least the end credits retain the original music in its full orchestral splendor . there's very little about this movie that isn't disappointing . one might make the foolish assumption that for a pink panther film to be produced out ten years after the last disastrous entry in the series , there had to be a creative reason--preferably something new and inventive . instead , however , we are lumbered with this cobbled-together effort . if there's a mercy , it's that son of the pink panther should finally put the clouseau family to rest . then again , that's what i thought about the curse of the pink panther . 
2	a truly magificent and authentic film set in the sparsely populated mountainous region of dolpo in northwest nepal . its appeal is both visually and in its compelling story about the tibetan villagers who live by their traditions . the cast is made up of mostly non-professionals who have not only not acted before , but some have never even seen a film . their wonderful expressive faces are reflective of the mountains and give the film its very appealing look . himalaya is noteworthy for its breathtaking shots of mountains that scale as high as 10 , 000 feet , as valli daringly shot this almost impossible mountain trek for nine months in all kinds of conditions--including a blinding winter snowstorm . it was shot in cinemascope using wide-angle panoramic framed shots and was nominated for an oscar as best foreign film , but lost to pedro almodovar's all about my mother . the story in its simplicity can be viewed as a fable about a generational conflict between a stubborn religious traditionalist set in his ways versus the younger man who is influenced by the pragmatism of modern ways and is just as pigheaded as his opponent . the film becomes in its second half an amazing visual spectacle and a challenge to the filmmaker to record the earnest story in the most difficult of locations , as it follows the two parties through the barren highland valleys and unsafe mountain passes . it's a testament to the spirit and courage of these followers of tibetan culture , who strive to carry on the traditions . it's ultimately a film about finding out who you are and about living in harmony with nature . i enjoyed it immensely and believe this rare film will be remembered for the simplicity of its very human story and the deep respect it has for a way of life that is endangered . if it wasn't a more penetrating look at the nepal villagers and their superstitions and if the drama wasn't more subtle--so be it ! that might be the task of another filmmaker . what this film did was show us a way of life that few have ever witnessed , and it did it in a spirited pictorial manner . 
1	screenplay : alan zweibel and jessie nelson . director : rob reiner . it is a wonderfully affecting moment , beautifully performed by pfeiffer with all the love and frustration that makes up a marriage . it's also a moment that is a complete cheat . theoretically , the story of us is the story of how easy it is , in the middle of all the white noise and tension of everyday life , to lose track of why you fell in love with someone in the first place . unfortunately , it's such a fragmented narrative that it's just as easy for the _audience_ to lose track of why they fell in love in the first place . the script by alan zweibel and jessie nelson sprinkles flashbacks through the summer of the jordan's separation -- a peek at their meeting and first date here , an interrupted dalliance on the butcher block there -- but there aren't nearly enough of them . the story of us spends virtually all its time showing us the relationship already in trouble , making it incredibly difficult to appreciate what made the relationship good in the first place . we're asked to invest ourselves emotionally in the success or failure of the jordans' marriage without getting enough evidence that it should succeed . it's even more frustrating to realize that the story of us is so solid at its core that it could have been wonderful . the film is not always a pleasant experience , showing off some extremely unfair fighting between its protagonists and the wrenching moments when emotional damage seems beyond repair . willis and pfeiffer deftly turn their post-separation scenes into awkward shuffles between longing and despair ; where most films treat divorce either as all-acrimony or all-indifference , this one captures how much people want it all to work out . but at only 92 minutes , the story of us feels bereft of context . somewhere on the cutting room floor is the arc of a relationshp from affection to simple coexistence to a blur of petty bickering . if only more of the so-called humor had found its way to the same floor . wilson rants about how men never change the toilet paper roll , a gag that hasn't gotten any fresher since it was generated by bad stand-up comics 20 years ago . reiner waxes philosophical about how " there is no ass , just the fleshy tops of your legs . " reiser spends five minutes degrading an idea for a book about ben's grandparents , inspiring only stony silence from the audience . reiner and his writers keep trying so hard to lighten the mood they only end up breaking it , with little to show for their efforts but a few half-hearted chuckles . it's easy to see the comedy as part of reiner's attempt to create a companion piece to his 1989 gem when harry met sally . with its direct addresses to the camera and hairdo-change time lapses , the story of us does sometimes feel like when harry left sally . yet while this film was unlikely to be as purely entertaining , it could have been far more resonant . some of the individual scenes in the story of us are heartbreaking , and a few are truly charming . they just never quite add up to the story of them in a way that provides real catharsis . it's easy to understand why those snippets would move katie to tears ; after all , she lived those moments . the story of us could have moved us all if only we'd been allowed to live them , too . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
0	it's always good around halloween to have one really bad horror movie to look forward to . alas , this year's lone october horror release , thinner , falls considerably short of the level of awfulness established by last year's halloween 6 . while this latest adaptation of a stephen king novel doesn't approach " good " film making , it's at least watchable ( if just barely ) -- a quality that no one would ascribe to the most recent chapter of the unbearably moronic michael myers saga . there are two kinds of movies based on stephen king stories -- the dramas ( stand by me , the shawshank redemption ) and the horrors ( pet sematary , the mangler ) . in general , the former are quite good while the latter are terrible . so , since thinner falls somewhere between genres , it's fitting that the film's quality is also somewhere in the middle . thinner is a rather shallow and unsatisfactory examination of some potentially-worthwhile themes and ideas . equally unfortunately , it's not at all scary . ( maybe he should consult with arnold schwarzenegger , star of this summer's eraser . ) unfortunately , questions of morality are of secondary importance to a film that emphasizes its death wish aspects . the most energetic parts of thinner are those that focus on billy's revenge , and this is no accident . the makeup that transforms 175-pound robert john burke into his 300-pound character is embarrassingly unconvincing , especially in the wake of the much better job done to expand eddie murphy's waistline in the nutty professor . for that matter , the prosthetics on michael constantine and several other actors don't look all that impressive , either . on top of its other problems , thinner is too long . there's not enough story here for a forty-five minute motion picture , not to mention something twice that length . as a result , there's a lot of pointless running around , a protracted dream sequence , and some meaningless " character building " scenes that don't build anything . on the whole , though , a slimmer running time , not to mention an astute script , would have made thinner go down a lot more smoothly . 
0	as a public service , i'm going to provide a simple conversion formula to help potential viewers decide whether or not they should see money talks : 1 ) begin with a base of zero on a 1-10 scale . 2 ) if you found chris tucker a riotous comedic presence in films like friday and the fifth element , add 10 points . 3 ) if tucker's every moment on screen during the fifth element made you want to tear out your own central nervous system with a shrimp fork , subtract 250 , 000 points . those individuals blissfully unfamiliar with the chris tucker oeuvre may be confused at this point . i envy such sweet naivete . tucker may be the most actively annoying screen presence since . . . well , blessed with a shudder-inducing nasal whine of a voice , tucker dares the audience to tolerate him by playing characters who simply refuse to shut up . and naturally , almost everyone franklin deals with is a complete idiot . considering the number of times franklin comments on james' posterior -- its narrowness , its whiteness , or its need to be kicked -- you'd think he might have a little crush on the fellow . in an " urban comedy , " you'd better make sure the audience knows you find " queers " even more obnoxious than white people . the amazing thing about money talks is that tucker _still_ manages to play the stupidest and most obnoxious character in the film . they also seemed thrilled every time something blew up , or every time someone got shot . perhaps that is why watching money talks was such a doubly depressing experience . not only did i have to stomach tucker's grating presence in the kind of wretched buddy comedy which makes other wretched buddy comedies look inspired , but i shared it with an audience which found high entertainment in the equivalent of rambo starring jerry lewis with tourette's syndrome . make that triply depressing : if money talks is a success , i could be sitting through another chris tucker project real soon . when you refer back to the conversion formula above , please amend item #3 to read " subtract 500 , 000 points .

1	date released : varies running length : 2 : 31 rated : nr ( nudity , mature themes ) starring : karen-lise mynster , erland josephson , ghita norby , torben zeller , jesper christensen director : liv ullmann producer : lars kolvig screenplay : liv ullmann and peter poulson from the novel mendel philipsen & son by henri nathensen music : various composers released by arrow entertainment danish with english subtitles those that see sofie will undoubtedly be struck by the similarities between this film and the work of ingmar bergman . considering those involved in the project , this is not surprising . sofie marks the directorial debut of the internationally-recognized actress liv ullmann , who began working with bergman in 1967's hour of the wolf . nevertheless , although sofie is a bergman kind of story with bergman-like characters , liv ullmann lacks bergman's mastery . for a debut , this is an ambitious , if not entirely successful , effort . it's rare for any movie , whether domestic or foreign , to cast such a group of plain actors and actresses . even though sofie is repeatedly referred to as beautiful , karen-lise mynster is far from ravishing ( although to call her homely would be a stretch ) . these casting choices , which in hollywood would be considered disastrous , work because they give the audience a sense that the story unfolding is happening to real people . the greatest flaw of sofie lies in its uneven pacing and choppy narrative style . numerous interesting events occur during the last quarter of the film , but the opportunity is not there to savor them . another problem is the emotional distance between the audience and the characters . for whatever reason , ullmann keeps sofie at arm's-length for most of the movie . some of this is undoubtedly a byproduct of the pacing , but the script waits too long to express sofie's motivation and for much of the movie she seems to be a reactive--and rather dull--person . one recurrent theme that is handled expertly is the inflexibility of time . once a decision is made , it cannot be undone , and things put off until tomorrow often never get accomplished . moments like these , although perhaps too far apart in this movie , recall bergman at his best . taken as a whole , sofie is an unhappy film , but some of what ullmann has done with the story keeps it from being an unrelenting source of depression . the director shows that even in the most tragic of existences , there are moments of simple joy and triumph . beyond the plodding pace of sofie , there's a great deal of worthwhile material . although the movie varies from dull to riveting , the acting is constant throughout . this is not a film for the " average " movie-goer , but for those who like character-driven stories that focus on the friction between generations , sofie is a worthy entry . it may lack many of the subtle touches of an ingmar bergman film , but it's unmistakable at whose hands liv ullmann learned her newest trade . 
1	i think i've seen this film before : it's called pulp fiction . but that aside , this is a very funny crime caper , involving double-crosses , kidnappings , and outrageous shootouts . it is stylized noir-- meaning noir is no more to be taken seriously as in the post-ww11 noir films . it is now used by many directors as a spoof of the genre , as it is here , by the first-time woman director , jennifer leitzes . the film relies on its characters to make things happen , as the story really is too slight to do the complete job , of making montana bigger than the small state of mind it is . it was scenes like this , coming in flashes , that kept the film alive . stanley tucci is a marvelous actor and is a joy to watch here . kyra sedgwick works well with tucci and significantly adds to the farcical nature of the film . philip seymour hoffman never gives a bad performance ; here he is the creepy turncoat , a part he can do in his sleep by now . but he does it well . the high level of acting raises this ordinary film in stature , but does not make it into anything more than a highly entertaining and derivative film . 
1	it's a colorful adventure story of saloon brawls , romance , and corruption . the brawl was unrealistic but marvelous to watch . the stellar cast of stars and noted supporting players keep the action rolling , as everyone seems just right for the parts they are playing . marlene couldn't be sexier , wearing brocades and gowns , changing from one gown to another at the drop of a beer stein . for comic moments , there is the dialogue between marlene and black maid marietta canty , who is yearning for a black dude to appear in the yukon .

2	alexander , played with pensive intensity by john turturro , is a compelling and endearing character who's rather like an idiot savant . we learn , for example , that the king is the center of attention but has limited powers , whereas the queen is more cunning and agile . two-time academy award nominee watson ( breaking the waves and hilary and jackie ) , whose talent is so large and impressive that she quietly dominates most movies she appears in , manages to be no less accomplished this time , but her performance is eclipsed by an even better one by turturro . with his bad suits , unkempt hair and constant need for a shave , alexander sticks out like a sore thumb at the expensive resort . you will be consumed watching the movie . after several twists , only some of which are easy to guess , the story ends quite surprisingly and quite satisfactorily , although not in any conventional sense . one shudders to think how a big studio version of this story would conclude . it is rated pg-13 for some sensuality and thematic elements . although it would be acceptable for most kids , it has little to offer those under 13 . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
0	li's days as a mild mannered librarian named tsui are numbered . the movie's whole purpose is to revel in obscenely violent action sequences . ) this movie could be dedicated to those adults who secretly crave hideously violent video games but wouldn't be caught dead playing one . let us count the ways . there's the garden-style sprinkler with enough acid to wipe out an entire gang with a single swirl . i'm getting nauseated . let's stop this disgusting enumeration . the movie works sporadically only as a parody of its own genre . even as a gorefest , it manages to drag frequently . perhaps the repetition just wears out your senses . to its credit the stunts are impressive . too impressive some will argue . but , for those of you who thought pulp fiction was too tame , this is the picture for you . the new release in the theaters is done with a surprisingly credible english dubbing . the 1996 video has english subtitles and doesn't have the new soundtrack . the film contains massive , strong violence , profanity and sadomasochism . it is inappropriately rated r since it is clearly an nc-17 film and should be treated as such by parents . ( the mpaa remains incredibly liberal about violence but is very squeamish about nudity . which do you think is more dangerous to today's teens ? ) if you're worried about your kids seeing violent images , this is the quintessential film for them to avoid .

" this is one of the better pieces of dialog in disney's remake of that darn cat , but it , like the rest of the humor in the show , elicits little laughter . the film is so bad that i found myself wishing it had a laugh track . with a laugh track i could at least pretend the movie was funny . i am careful to warn my readers about films . for this one there is a simple admonition : get coffee . unless you imbibe significant amounts of caffeine before entering the theater , you stand a good chance of not being able to stay awake through the many long and dull parts . the original 1965 movie version of that darn cat starred hayley mills and dean jones . it was not the sort of classic film that might suggest that a remake was in order nor did the remake's producer , robert simonds , have any fresh ideas for the project . the film appears to have been made solely for a quick profit . simonds seems to have figured that any disney film featuring a animal had to be a success . the remake is devoid of imagination and creative energy . ricci gives a lifeless performance . perhaps she should have heeded my coffee advice . this part , which was acted by jones in the original , is played for broad humor by doug e . doug in the remake . although i hated doug's performance , i do give him credit for being the only actor to exert any effort . even the cat in the picture is given nothing challenging to do . i have three cats , and all are more emotive than d . c . patti looks the agent sternly in the eye and says , " you're not a cat person , are you ? " most of the film relies on sight gags that you have seen a million times before . etc . , ad nauseam . in a typically unfunny scene kelso comes to patti's rescue . " you smell really bad , " says patti . director bob spiers , whose previous experience was directing television series , tries to end the show with a bang , but the lengthy chase scene is as repetitive and tiring as the rest of the picture . the show's biggest conundrum is the script . they also did the script for ed wood . both of these scripts are wonderful and highly creative . although i do not understand it , i think there may be a hint in the press kit . every one associated with the film has a lengthy biography except for them . no mention is made of their previous pictures . could it be because they whipped up this screenplay without much thought , and now want to disassociate themselves from the project ? too often critics are too easy on kids' movies . if the pictures are lifeless but harmless , they give them two stars . this version of that darn cat has nothing to challenge minds of any age , and the jokes are pathetic . whereas i do not doubt that many kids will like it , it could and should have been so much better . why shouldn't we aim a bit higher for our youngsters ? intelligent scripts can be both successful and funny , as the one for toy story proved . it is rated pg for some explosions and one mild expletive . it would be fine for most kids although the loud noises might scare some kids under 4 . i give this pitiful excuse for a movie thumbs down and a single * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	writer and director david mamet's the winslow boy , loosely based on this actual case , is gem of a picture in the spirit of the age of innocence . most of the action , such as it is , takes place on the sidelines . people talk about trials and possible trials rather than attending them . emotions are carefully held in check as they would have been in that era , but the absolutely exquisite performances by the ensemble cast insure that the characters' feelings are nonetheless intense even though displayed with subtlety and grace . you may remember rebecca pidgeon as the slick confidence scheme operator from mamet's last picture , the spanish prisoner . she brings a compelling precision and intelligence to all of her parts . in a movie with a lesser cast , hawthorne's masterful performance would have stolen the movie , but his turns out to be but one of many bright lights . " if you tell me a lie , i shall know , because a lie between us can't be hidden , " he warns . the boy , who looks like innocence personified , swears that he's not guilty . mamet , the master of ambiguity and unanswered questions , makes you wonder right away what the truth is and how that truth will be determined . as the charismatic and handsome sir robert , jeremy northam delivers an absolutely mesmerizing performance . a highly intelligent man who keeps his opponents and his supporters guessing what he will do next , sir robert is a master legal and political strategist and the type of busy man who allocates you only a few minutes of his precious time to see if it's worth ever seeing you again . the charged relationship between these two opposites , who have to pull together , turns out to be easily the most interesting of several subplots . like the rest of the movie , this relationship makes some twists you don't expect and avoids others that you do . although the script doesn't have much of mamet's signature dialog style , in which two characters exchange fast-paced staccato repartee , it has the overall structure he likes and has a host of fully developed characters . the heart-warming story is the type that frank capra would have loved . slowly and delicately the movie lays out a series of questions for us ? is the boy innocent , or might it not be as cut and dried as it seems ? the beauty and intelligence of the winslow boy methodically lays out questions where lesser movies would quickly provide easy answers . it is rated g and would be fine for kids old enough to be interested in serious subjects . 
1	" it's not showgirls " one trailer for striptease bluntly announces , capping off a marketing campaign which may be the first in recent memory to attempt to convince the movie-going public that a new film is _nothing_ like a previous film . sure , it works the other way all the time , thanks to pre-fabricated critical blurbs like " this year's forrest gump " or reminders of the director's previous successes , but the stink of showgirls is such that it threatens to contaminate anything featuring a pelvis and a pole . of course , if you remembered that writer-director andrew bergman is behind such comedic gems as the in-laws , the freshman and honeymoon in vegas , you'd know not to expect showgirls . the real question is whether you'd expect striptease , a film as inconsistent in its tone as it is occasionally hilarious . moore received the surprising sum of $12 . 5 million to bump-and-grind her way through striptease , and at the very least the producers should take solace in the fact that she picked up dancing a heck of a lot faster than she has picked up this whole acting thing . there is something both smug and overly earnest about moore's standard screen pose , as though she never wanted there to be any doubt that she felt deeply about whatever her predicament might be , but also that nothing could stop her if she set her mind to it . in striptease , that is a major problem . this is supposed to be a frisky comedy , but moore's deadly serious performance acts like ankle weights on a swimmer . there are scenes between her and armand assante which seem to come from a second-rate tv-movie -- " baring her soul : the erin grant story . " that's a real shame , because there are plenty of moments in striptease where bergman's wonderfully weird sense of humor gets to shine through . burt reynolds is completely over the top as dilbeck , a pathetic , fetishistic drunkard who coats himself in vaseline and sniffs erin's dryer lint before addressing a young christians' conference , and there is something improbably enjoyable about the way reynolds doesn't even pretend to modulate his performance . bergman makes fine use of oddball supporting characters , and seasons striptease liberally with his trademark unpredictability , like a priceless scene during the film's climax involving erin's daughter , two well-endowed dancers and a jump-rope . there are plenty of laughs in striptease , enough to make it moderately entertaining , but the reason striptease isn't a better movie is that they're the wrong _kind_ of laughs for the material . based on carl hiaasen's novel , the story demands a darker edge in its political satire , a sense of irony that the topless dancer is one of the few characters in the film with any morals . that simply isn't andrew bergman's style ; his comedy may be wild , but it's always good-natured . when burt reynolds' congressman is as absurd a character as the general played by richard libertini in the in-laws , it's tough to extract any biting commentary . the result is a film which is moving in several different directions at once : the source material is trying to make it dark , bergman is trying to make it silly , and moore is trying to make it serious . when it's silly , striptease is super , but a lot of the time it's not clear _what_ striptease is . except , of course , that it's _not_ showgirls . 
2	the lion king is technically an amazing and dazzling movie . i find it hard to review a cartoon . perhaps , i could start by discussing some of the characters that were made special by the actor's voice . irons is brilliant in everything he does , but i think his best roles were brideshead revisited and reversal of fortune . he can play villains and good guys equally well . james earl jones was the voice of mufasa , and although he was good , i expected more out of one of the most dramatic sounding voices in the movies today . jones could have been a great orator ( read politician i guess ) had he not become an actor . whoopi goldberg was funny as a laughing hyena . i liked everyone except mathew broderick who i felt was too weak and unconvincing as the grown up simba . the movie's strengths , however , were not in the characters . the images and the soundtrack were the highlights . all of the music was very moving . the images had a 3d effect that i have not seen before . there was clear foreground and background in almost every shot , and sometimes they even varied the focus as you would in a " real " movie so that at first the foreground was in focus and then the background . my favorite part of the entire show was the vibrance of the colors . monet would have come every day to see the lion king . sad to say , i can not give it as high a rating as i would liked for two reasons . first , the story and the characters were okay , but they were not as interesting as they could have been . when they have to resort to lots of jokes about gas and bad breath , you know the script writers have run out of steam . second , the main audience for this movie is little kids . and if they felt they had to kill off a character , why be so explicit ? yes , this part of life does happen , but so does rape , incest , drive-by shootings and a lot of other stuff . being true to life does not mean we have to subject little kids to it . by the way , my son spent almost the whole movie in one of our laps , but claimed in the end to have not been scared ( he was clearly scared while it was going on ) , and wanted to see it again . actually , he wants to see lassie even more . i am glad we went , and i do recommend the show with the reservations noted . i give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	the degree to which they stretched the truth for dramatic purposes , i have no idea since i know only of beethoven 's music and little of his life other than he was deaf at the end . for some reason , the script's plausibility never bothered me , and i took the movie totally on face value . immortal beloved is told as a mystery , but actually the mystery is more of a ruse to be able to tell the story of beethoven's life in a fresh way . his music turned his female fans ( isabella rosselini , johanna ter steege , valeria golino , and others ) into ecstasy , and he had many lovers , groupies if you will . perhaps . i am not a big fan of gary oldman . i found his sid and nancy repulsive in the extreme . he has done some acting i like , but his specialty is playing despicable characters ( he was lee harvey oswald in jfk ) . the minor character parts of the movie played by steege and golino i found i enjoyed the most . now , unless you are an historian , comes the only real reason to see movie--the music . the show opens with a piano sonata and ends with an amazing set of images while playing the ode to joy part of beethoven's last symphony . what do you think of when you hear his choral symphony ? i sure never thought of what they did , yet it worked wonderfully well . the music is all directed by sir . i have to mention the art decoration as another outstanding part . you are transported to 18th century vienna , and it feels so real you think you are in a time machine . actually , the credits show it was filmed in prague , but hey , save a few bucks wherever you can i suppose . the script is pretty outlandish and tries to cover way too much material . the editing is too choppy . finally , i just did not buy oldman as beethoven . i thought he was miscast and he certainly overacted . it does seem like producers feel they can only make movies about composers if they show them as bizarre and quirky individuals . i think back to the only movie about by far and away my favorite composer - gustav mahler . it was called simply mahler . sure . the movie runs too long at 2 : 03 , but if they felt that they had to cover as much ground as they attempted , then it should have been a 3 or 4 hour movie . [actually , the show featured some very effective kissing . ] i think older teenagers could see it though since it does present the items above in a non-exploitive fashion . if you are a lover of classical music , then you will probably enjoy yourself as i did ; otherwise , i would say skip it . i give it a very mild thumbs up overall , and i award it * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : january 26 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	it is a remake of the 1952 movie of the same name by zoltan korda . this movie features james earl jones as an anglican priest by the name of stephen kumalo , and it is clearly the best performance of jones's long career of over eighty movies . cry the beloved country starts with sweeping vistas of great beauty filmed in luscious color thanks to the cinematography by paul gilpin . although i have never been to south africa , the terrain reminded me of the scottish highlands where i have visited . the beauty of south africa resonates perfectly with the richness of jones's voice in the narration . my people go there never to return . " the movie spends more time than most movies dealing with spirituality in general and the true meaning of christianity in particular . it is refreshing to see a movie where people of the cloth are taken seriously for a change . the marvelous script by ronald harwood and direction by darrell roodt weave a tale of great power and sadness but do it in an understated fashion that never manipulates the audience's emotions . nevertheless , there was many a tear shed in the theater i was at , and i could hear frequent sobbing . the ending is perfect , and i think hopeful . ah , the acting . everyone in the movie was quite good , but jones was head and shoulders above everyone else . a more moving and powerful performance i have not seen in a long time . if he does not get an academy award nomination for it , they ought to disband the academy as hopeless lost . the music by john barry is extremely moving without ever being overpowering . i love the costumes ( rui filipe ) especially the large brimmed hats that the priests wear . cry the beloved country runs a fast 1 : 49 thanks to crisp editing ( david heitner ) . the movie is rated pg-13 for a little violence , but there is no sex , nudity or bad language . i would have no trouble taking kids 10 and over . this is a subtle but wonderful film that i recommend to you strongly , and i give it * * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : december 21 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	this original youth film , that has the look of a pseudo-documentary but is a work of fiction , with the nonprofessional actors seemingly changing mid-scene from reading a script to doing ad-libs , fails to answer the simple questions i put to it about what it is trying to accomplish . this is director and writer , harmony korine's ( screenwriter for kids ) , debut film as a director , accomplished with all the verve and necessary shock and schlock he can muster . what results is a pointless but engaging romp through a midwestern fictional suburban city , xenia , ohio , and its dysfunctional inhabitants , mostly white redneck youth , who either seem retarded or prone to violence , as they are searching for something to do with themselves in a city still suffering from the devastations of a tornado . korine is non-judgmental about any of his characters . but is that necessarily a good thing ? what saves this film from being a complete absurdity , is the raw energy exhibited by the director , as he is on the cutting edge of cinema verite , showing the pent-up hostility and alienation these trashy young people have . he seems to be painting his words with images of the most freakish things you can see in america's wasteland , and not caring whether you believe what you are seeing or not--his aim seems to be to shock the audience and for the audience to respond and say how " hip " he is to be showing us all these revolting and boring images . but is that enough to make this a satisfactory film ? two skin head teens senselessly punching it out with each other for an interminable amount of time in their kitchen for fun and macho pride . but by showing all these freaks , is the director not just using them without any purpose but to exploit their oddness ? is this funny scene a comment on single-moms ? the film has an attention disorder disturbance of its own , as it keeps going at random from one vignette to another , without any deciferable plot or storyline , which should be a real treat for heavy metal enthusiasts with low attention spans and those who respect the personal creative nature of film and can overcome the depravity of what they are seeing and its immature fixations , and be impressed with the film's originality . for those lucky souls , they have found a film that is a rarity . but have they found a good film ? others who might like this film , could be taken in by the audaciousness of the director's style and the fast-pace of the film and its easy disposable use of images . but to its credit , the film does capture some of the fears the youths have about growing up and it does show that there are no role models around to help the children . but does the filmmaker really care about what he is seeing ? this film will probably be viewed as one that you either hate or love , and no one can convince you otherwise . since i was caught being in a voyeuristic mode by some of the film , then found myself tuning it out as i became bored with it ; i , therefore , can only say that the film did not work for me . it is hard for me to warm up to those who kill cats , yet i wanted to see how the minds of such people work . that i found out . which is the problem i had with watching the film , as i felt that i didn't need a mind to see it . this film lacked the needed pathos to make the youngsters' story seem more than a provocative freak show ; it failed to offer some meaning to their life , which resulted in giving the film a disjointed look , even though korine should be applauded for sticking to his personal vision . but , the final question is , do you think the director is really interested in showing us anything but a freak show ? 
2	what would it be like if celebrated playwright and screenwriter david mamet collaborated with franz kafka ? while we'll never know for sure , the spanish prisoner gives a good indication . this film , the fifth to be authored and directed by mamet ( whose recent script contributions include the edge and wag the dog ) , is both a sendup of the hitchcock-type thriller and a legitimate entry into the genre . it's mamet's most convoluted plot since house of games , but , while the overall structure and style are of noir twistiness , the underlying message is something almost any viewer can relate to : how corporate greed destroys trust and corrupts honest men . mamet's script supplies us with a seemingly-endless series of twists and turns , only a fraction of which are predictable . at times , the audience is a step ahead of the screenplay , but , most of the time , we're playing catch-up . although there are plenty of holes that mamet has no interest is sewing up ( trying to solve every riddle in the spanish prisoner is an exercise in futility ) , this is a smart film that develops a central character we can sympathize with ? a modern version of josef k . from kafka's the trial . the plot is delightfully preposterous , but holds together a lot better than the generic likes of palmetto and wild things . the difference is simple : those two films are for viewers who prefer to turn their brains off while the spanish prisoner is for anyone who likes to think and feel along with the characters . the most curious thing about the spanish prisoner is the ending ( which i will not reveal in this review ) . at first glance , it appears to be a common wrap-up that ties together several critical loose ends . there's a deus ex machina aspect to it which may indicate that mamet is toying with the audience by sending up the manner in which this kind of movie must end to satisfy an audience . but are things as straightforward as they seem ? is this , in fact , the end , or is it just the latest twist in an incredibly complex con game ? the dialogue is , of course , pure mamet . the writer/director's characteristic style infuses every exchange with its peculiar , staccato rhythm . there are those who find mamet's approach to be off-putting , but , for movie-goers who allow its strange allure to captivate them ( which usually takes a few minutes ) , it becomes apparent how crucial it is to the film's overall tone . mamet has achieved something extraordinary ? a pg rating . one of the reasons the film is so strong is that nearly every major performance is impeccable . steve martin plays jimmy dell with the right mix of charm and menace . the subtext of this film is the same as the one in many other mamet offerings ? how the current business climate rewards those who act ruthlessly and punishes those who hold to a code of ethics . with a plot that would make hitchcock proud , the spanish prisoner uses this outrageously elaborate , always-entertaining approach to illustrate these more serious concerns about what it takes to survive the '90s . " my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . " -- david puttnam 
2	exactly how much pain would you be willing to endure for a chance to win a nissan pickup truck worth $15 , 000 ? the best documentaries consider offbeat subjects that seem on the surface to have no broad appeal . bindler takes us into an annual human endurance contest with the result being one of the funniest and most involving films of the year as we get to know the contestants . the best part of this life-affirming film about blue-collar workers is that the sympathetic filmmaker avoids the cheap shots while still producing a film that has the audience frequently in stitches . there are 5-minute breaks every hour . any infraction of these rules , no matter how brief , immediately disqualifies the person . the film creates a wonderful arc as the audience goes from initially laughing at these country folks with their funny sounding , thick texas accents to laughing with them and then , finally , empathizing with their quest . by the end of the movie , the viewers become glued to their seats wondering who among their newfound friends will next succumb to the pain and have to drop out or will be forced out through some silly blunder . each time someone leaves the vehicle you can almost hear the audience sigh . as the film's philosopher , and clearly the man to beat , he explains that it went 87 hours the year he won . although the movie works as sport , the real beauty comes from the people we get to know . " it is extremely crazy . it's a human drama thing . " not everyone has the mettle , he reminds us . " if you can't run with the big dogs , " he declares , " you better stay on the porch with the pups . " built like a bowling bowl and just as strong , she's certain to be a contender for this year's crown . why , because he was offered such a great deal on it . there is a sandra bullock lookalike , and a host of other individuals who seem straight out of central casting for their variety . he figures that if he doesn't put too much in , not too much will want to come out . their collective stamina is amazing . this piece of americana has an ending that is surprising in many ways , not the least of which is how sudden and unexpected it is . " the very basic human values . " benny was proven right again . it is rated pg for a little bad language and would be fine for all ages . the film is playing now in extremely limited distribution . 
1	whereas the original stuck to formula laughs with one slapstick gag after another , the sequel turns its attention to character development and to the subject of love . although still not memorable entertainment , it is much better than the first . beethoven successfully hits it off with missy , and the result is four of the sweetest little puppies ( moe , chubby , dolly , and tchaikovsky ) you have ever seen . ryce enters what appears to be a sweet romance and gets her first kiss in a touching scene . later in the film , we have an uncalled-for sequence about underage drinking and the beginnings of date rape . this has no place in a sweet little nostalgic picture about love and puppies . my childhood was just like that so this struck a chord with me . again , i can remember so well the sinking feeling of being rejected for a date . did she really already have a date for that night or was she just saying it so that you would go away ? even little emily comes alive in the sequel . bonnie hunt's part as the mother is better drawn too than the first , and hunt is more animated . only charles grodin manages to give just as dismal a performance in the sequel as in the original . this great comedic genius sleepwalks through both films . as in the original , the cinematography ( bill butler ) and the sets ( lawrence miller ) are middle town america at its best . a dreamy and nostalgic feeling . there are lots of nice images , my favorites being one with a pup on george's head and one of a puppy on a skateboard . my favorite part of the picture is the ending , especially the dream sequence and the " earthquake " scene . i am not giving anything away by telling you this , but when you see the show , you will recognize them based on the above description . it is rated pg . this is no sex , nudity or violence . the movie is fine for kids of any age although i do wish they had deleted the above mentioned scenes . i liked this one a lot more than the first , but not quite enough to recommend it . i give it * * for its sweetness , but i wish it would have had more substance . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	screenplay : ruth prawer jhabvala . producers : ismail merchant , david l . wolper . director : james ivory . mpaa rating : r ( brief nudity , adult themes ) running time : 125 minutes . i'm not sure what it is that inspired the highly respected merchant ivory production team to turn from fiction to biography , but i wish they would drop it already . for years , director james ivory , producer ismail merchant and screenwriter ruth prawer jhabvala turned out exceptionally well-crafted adaptations of novels commonly held to be too difficult to film : a room with a view , howards end , the remains of the day . surviving picasso is not nearly as paralyzingly dull , but it demonstrates once again that real people seem to elude ivory and company . surviving picasso is a particularly frustrating piece of work because you can see what it is ivory was trying to do . mcelhone , a newcomer with piercing eyes , brings out the intelligence in francoise , but she becomes a distressingly passive character , even more so when she becomes a narrator for flashbacks . her unique personality has little chance to emerge , and even seems to be contradicted directly by a voice-over near the end in which francoise notes that picasso " made me strong . " picasso himself is similarly enigmatic , played by anthony hopkins as an egomanical bon vivant , turning his fame into a method for making people feel insignificant , and honored merely to be in his presence . ivory and jhabvala do a fine job of showing us the effect of picasso's behavior on those around him , but they are much less effective at showing us the man himself . we are never allowed inside the passionate artist ; hopkins is technically proficient , wandering accent notwithstanding , but his is a role which seems designed to be observed rather than understood . you can always count on a merchant ivory film to look splendid , and there is superb work once again from cinematographer tony pierce-roberts and production designer lucianna arrighi . it is a beautiful environment they have created for this story , but the characters in that environment are disappointing . there are several moments in surviving picasso which inspire a curiosity about this fascinating man , notably his rivalry with contemporary henri matisse ( joss ackland ) , but there is always the nagging sense , as there was in jefferson in paris , that ivory doesn't really have a point of view . his biographies are safe , almost documentary detailings of events in an individual's life which do not add up to a story . picasso and jefferson were both fascinating historical figures with private and public lives full of contradictions , and they should have made for great drama . ivory simply seems too respectful of his subjects , content to lay out events like they might appear in a history text without much in the way of interpretation . the irony is that he has been able to take far more internalized fictional characters , like the remains of the day's james stevens , and make them extraordinarily vivid . 
0	screenplay : kevin brodie and robert singer , based on the story by ouida . director : kevin brodie . mpaa rating : pg ( adult themes , violence ) running time : 100 minutes . i note the following in the interest of fairness : a smattering of audience applause greeted the conclusion of a dog of flanders at the screening i attended . that audience consisted almost entirely of parents and pre-teens , causing me to ponder comments i've received over the years regarding whether " family films " should be held to a different critical standard . sure , a dog of flanders could appeal to children without very discriminating tastes ; yes , parents may be happy to find something warm 'n' fuzzy for the young'uns . i , however , watched as someone who expects little things like decent performances , a narrative with a point , and a script that doesn't feel like it was written _by_ children instead of _for_ children . a dog of flanders is simple , non-threatening , harmless family filmmaking that also happens to be thoroughly uninteresting on almost any level . but nello always perseveres , entering a youth art contest and maintaining a pure and honest heart . if you notice the conspicuous lack of any dog mentioned in that plot summary , there's a very good reason . despite the title , nello's pet bouvier des flanders , patrasche , plays only a token role in the film's events . that's not just unfortunate because it's somewhat deceptive -- it's unfortunate because the dog may turn in the film's best performance . the young performers , particularly newcomer farren monet , at least have inexperience as an excuse . voight and warden , who fuss and knit their brows and play with ever-varying accents , earn no such slack . a dog of flanders may be a youth melodrama , but there's not a moment of real character-based emotion to make the film tolerable as a narrative . it's hard to imagine how a production like this avoided the direct-to-video dustbin . it's also hard to imagine from this version that the story is such a classic that it has already been filmed three previous times . without a familiarity with either the source material or the earlier film incarnations , i can only assume that a story with such appeal had to focus on the adventures of a boy and his faithful dog . otherwise , a dog of flanders delivers the kind of timeless youth appeal one usually associates with an evening of cnn . those who enjoy the film will probably find ways in which those elements complement the story perfectly . for me , a dog of flanders lacked any of the elements which bring life to a family film -- emotional resonance , strong relationships , well-drawn characters . i'm not going to deny the appeal of a protagonist who perseveres and maintains a pure and honest heart , especially for parents looking to teach strength of character . it would have been nice , however , to build a watchable film around that strength of character . i'll leave this one to those parents and children who watch with a heroic generosity of spirit , those who won't leave thinking the real dog is the film itself . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
2	screenplay : richard curtis . director : mike newell . where romantic comedy is concerned , i am a tough sell . too many of them seem to put across the impression that all you need to do is put two people on the screen and have them end up together , regardless of whether or not they are developed with an interesting conflict ( or even speak to one another , as in the monstrously overhyped sleepless in seattle ) . i'm not going to turn into a pile of goo every time i see a screen kiss , but i will respond if i've spent two hours with two well-developed characters who seem to belong together . the new british comedy four weddings and a funeral delivers only halfway . hugh grant turns in a charming , star-making performance in this uneven character piece , but andie macdowell always appears to be more of a prop than a person . four weddings and a funeral was written by richard curtis , co-creator of the popular british television import " black adder , " a series not renowned for its sentimentality . and four weddings is extremely winning when it's not focusing on relationships . there are enough of these lively set pieces that four weddings rarely lags for too long , and the laughs come at fairly regular intervals . part of the problem is that in an attempt to create yet another ensemble friends piece he overloads the film with supporting characters , giving short shrift to the crucial relationship between charles and carrie . only james fleet , as befuddled aristocrat tom , provides any spark to the proceedings . the simple fact is that i kept losing track of the relationships between all these people , and didn't particularly care when i could figure them out . this lack of focus is inexcusable considering the cursory treatment carrie's character is given . part of four weddings and a funeral's message about love is that we should all be looking for that one person who makes " lightning strike , " and while the romantic sentiment is laudable it also assumes that we as an audience should recognize it when we see it . hugh grant , looking frighteningly like harold lloyd in his horn-rims , is an absolute delight ; he turns charles into a wonderful , funny , fallible character , and we want to see him happy . but carrie is simply a plot device . we know virtually nothing about her except that charles has a crush on her , and andie macdowell is not subtle enough an actress to fill in the blanks . it also might have been helpful to understand charles' romantic history better , which could have been accomplished through a more complete picture of ex-girlfriend henrietta , but that too is absent . there is much to recommend four weddings and a funeral as a comedy ; it's bright and spirited and well-paced . as a romance , it leaves much to be desired . . . primarily a second party for the romantic pairing . 
1	yes , that is the obvious question . why would director gus van sant want to reconstruct the alfred hitchcock classic from 1960 , psycho ? and why , instead of reinterpreting it , did he actually recreate the film shot-by-shot with precisely the same timing and camera angles . the question is why -- other than curiosity -- would audiences want to see it ? it is here that van sant provides no answers . whereas the original was fascinating and shocking , the reconstruction is bland and lifeless . the reconstruction could easily be summarized in a single word -- tedious . the reconstruction is well cast but not well acted . vince vaughn isn't particularly creepy as norman bates . the normally emotive anne heche plays marion crane with facial expressions that border on blank slates . heche delivers probably the weakest performance of her career . to be fair , both actors may just have been following the director's instructions , but it is truly a shame to see such talent wasted . and they aren't the only excellent actors to appear in the film . are there any differences ? well , not many other than the obvious one of a switch to color from the black-and-white original . there are a few modest changes , but i'll let you discover them . keeping your eye out for them is one of the few ways to pass the time while waiting for the movie to end . one particularly infuriating semi-change is that the director can't make up his mind on the time period . the result is just as strange . why one would want to see either dead animals or a dead movie is the mystery . it is rated r for violence , nudity and sex and would be fine for teenagers . 
2	citizen ruth has the audacity to skewer both sides of the most controversial issue in america today -- abortion . they figure that the judge's twisted logic of kill the fetus through an abortion or i will try you for abusing the fetus will turn the case into a cause celebre , which it does . laura dern , acting for just union scale wages , gives a brilliant and unflinching performance in a totally unsympathetic role . if you've never seen a spray paint can sniffer in action -- i hadn't -- then you have no idea how gross it can be . the script by first-time screenwriters alexander payne and jim taylor never tries to gloss over her actions or give her some big redemptive scene . her serious role is the fulcrum that supports the rest of the characters , who are drawn so broadly that they become delicious parodies . so , you ask , can they form a compelling story out of this ? the tug of war over the baby in ruth's body becomes the basis of a comedy that works surprisingly well . first-time director alexander payne , one of the co-writers , has a deft sense of how to balance the serious with the comedy and balance the goring of both sides of the political debate . i was at a special screening of the film at which the film's editor kevin tent spoke . he said that although he believes the film does not favor either side , many people with strong views pro or con on abortion believe that it favors their own camp . it just isn't done . other anti-abortion activists are more articulate . diane's unabashed lesbianism does not shock ruth , but how little diane ends up caring for ruth does . both sides call in their big battleships -- their respective national leaders . here reynolds displays some long hidden talent . ) " . . . keep the chart handy as we figure the capitalization effect on your assets , " advises larry . to this ruth moans , " why can't i ever have what i want ? " and later , " my body belongs to me ! " nevertheless , the show is resolved in a fresh and pleasantly surprising ending . the first was about the film's distribution problems . even so , miramax never put it into general release . one member of the audience speculated that perhaps the film was considered a hot potato since it poked fun at so many groups . tent went on to talk about the editing of the picture . he said that he was surprised at the casting of kurtwood smith as the father since he usually plays a heartless bad guy . smith ended up being so funny that they had to edit out a lot of his scenes to keep the movie from going overboard . the other tidbit he gave was that originally there was an additional ending added after the film's current ending . some of the scenes were left on the cutting room floor , but a few of them made it into the final print . she switches them off and turns to a soap opera . tent says the role of the editor and director is that of hypnotists . well , he and payne certainly hypnotized and mesmerized our audience with their delightful and insightful black comedy . it would be fine for older teenagers . i recommend the film to you and give it * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	cast : victoria foyt , viveca lindfors , jon robin baitz , andre gregory , martha plimpton , brooke smith , roddy mcdowall director : henry jaglom producer : judith wolinsky screenplay : henry jaglom and victoria foyt cinematography : hanania baer u . s . distributor : the rainbow film co . with a style that's a cross between vanya on 42nd st . and a home movie , henry jaglom's last summer in the hamptons pulls the viewer in . this intimate look at a dysfunctional family uses a perspective so seemingly-real that it would be easy to mistake parts of this film for a documentary rather than a work of fiction . hanania baer's straightforward cinematography contributes to the illusion , as does a script with frank dialogue that often concentrates on minutiae . the story , which is really just an excuse for monologues on assorted profundities , dialogue about almost anything , and quirky character interaction , is set in east hampton , long island . screen life mirrors real life in last summer in the hamptons . both have spent long , rewarding careers on screen and on stage , and have little cause to regret their choices . at the crux of last summer in the hamptons lies the age-old question of commercial viability versus artistic honesty . can something that makes money also be artistically pure ? this issue is mulled over during a number of the film's seemingly-endless conversations , with all sorts of interesting viewpoints coming to light . there is , of course , no resolution . the melodrama illustrating the emotional fractures within the family is less successful . according to him , none of them can do anything without turning it into a performance . jaglom occasionally goes overboard trying to get us to care about the characters . the well-honed dialogue and intimate camerawork would have been enough without the soap-opera-like interludes . as might be expected , the best performance is turned in by viveca lindfors , who , like jean moreau , could boast screen presence even at an advanced age . she heads a cast that doesn't have many weak participants . when the screenplay grows thin , the wealth of acting ability pushes last summer in the hamptons through the rough spots . whether tightly-scripted or not , many scenes have an improvised feel . last summer in the hamptons is tailor-made for those who enjoy talky , somewhat pretentious , dialogue-rich motion pictures . while the character interaction isn't as sharp as in an eric rohmer picture , it is deft enough to involve an interested audience . last summer in the hamptons isn't a landmark film , and it doesn't broach any new issues , but the unconventional style makes it worthwhile for those who appreciate offbeat fare . 
1	starring : denis leary , judy davis , kevin spacey . screenplay : richard lagravenese and marie weiss . good scripts are so rare in hollywood that it should be a felony when one gets wasted . sometimes it's dreadful miscasting ; sometimes it's a director without an ounce of vision . the dilemma in which i find myself in such cases is how to temper my response to the things the film failed to do with acknowledgment of its strengths . last year's true romance was one of those films , and the ref is another . there are a lot of laughs in the ref , more than most recent comedies have provided , yet i found it consistently and infuriatingly falling short of the comic plateau it might have achieved in more skilled directorial hands . the script for the ref , by richard lagravenese ( the fisher king ) and marie weiss , is full of comic and dramatic potential , only some of which ever makes it to the screen . comic denis leary gets the lead billing in his first starring role , but it is the sparring of spacey and davis which carries the film . their acid-filled tirades in the film's first half hour are extremely funny , and the two characters are surprisingly well-rounded . but the ref never makes the leap to the outrageous . leary and his director ted demme , who collaborated on a series of promo spots for mtv a couple of years ago which popularized leary's ranting , chain-smoking stand-up persona , seem too concerned here with separating leary from that persona . consequently , he plays a number of scenes far too low-key , and in fact fades into the background almost completely in the last half hour . a number of early verbal confrontations are exceptionally well-written , as all three of the principal characters make their case , and it is to the credit of lagravenese and weiss that at various times all three appear to be completely right and completely wrong . insults fly , and leary merely stands around looking exasperated . there are too many funny things going on in the ref for it to be a complete failure . i found the town's ill-prepared police force and its disgusted chief to be a hilarious subplot , and their handling of a piece of videotaped evidence is a winner . spacey and davis exchange some of the most caustic dialogue since the war of the roses , a style i always enjoy . 
2	as sally explains to her customer exactly why he can no longer have it his way , you might suspect that home fries will follow our plucky , unconventional heroine on her search for independence and true love through the world of greasy dining -- home fried green tomatoes , or something of the sort . the kind of quirky humor home fries deals out can easily become oppressive if not directed with a sure hand . first-time feature director dean parisot seems to know just how to drop the peculiar into a scene without pointing at it for you and slapping your knee . henry's wake features zamfir's pan flute rendition of " you light up my life . " and the sequence of most profound bonding between our two young lovers occurs at a natural childbirth class where the instructor tells her students " you didn't get into this with your legs closed , and you won't get out of it that way . " it's all consistently off-beat in a way that's more often refreshing than just plain weird , but it also comes with an undercurrent of sincerity . luke wilson -- deadpan in an " aw shucks " -appealing kind of way -- does a nice job with dorian's ambivalence over his bizarre family dynamics and his attraction to sally's sweet ( relative ) normalcy . there's something almost touching to the convoluted family tree dorian describes for sally's baby , since it comes with the hope that the next generation will somehow be less screwed up than the last . it's too bad that home fries concludes with an overwrought helicopter-car chase that feels ridiculously out of place . it's also too bad that drew barrymore can't make sally more interesting as the object of everyone's love or hate , her character slipping in and out of focus like her generically southern accent . ultimately , the story isn't even really about her . not exactly the stuff of a folksy , girl-appeal comedy-drama , is it ? see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
1	cast : kevin spacey , frank whaley , michelle forbes director : george huang producers : steve alexander and joanne moore screenplay : george huang cinematography : steven finestone music : tom hiel u . s . distributor : trimark pictures if robert altman's the player taught film makers one lesson , it's that it's hip to satirize hollywood . there have been a lot of recent motion pictures cashing in on this theme , with varying degrees of success . swimming with sharks , the latest entry , tries a slightly different tactic than most of these other movies--instead of focusing on writers prostituting their talent , george huang's picture looks at corporate ladder climbing within a fictional production studio . kevin spacey , in a performance that must be seen to be appreciated , plays buddy ackerman , the nastiest executive in the movie business . aside from rarely showing a trace of humanity , buddy loves to shout , insult , and generally demean everyone under him , and since he's the senior executive vice president of production , there are a lot of people in that category . spacey plays the role with relish , managing somehow to retain the skeleton of a legitimate character in what was written as a pure caricature . far more credit goes to the actor than to the script for ackerman's nasty , vicious flair . personal assistant to ackerman might be the first step up the corporate ladder , but it's a pretty dismal place to start . in this position , you're not supposed to think , just please and pamper the man who signs your checks . somewhere along the way , swimming with sharks loses its direction . what starts as a biting , and often effective , satire turns into a dramatic look at the dehumanizing effects of losing one's hopes and dreams . the split focus doesn't really work . not only is it disconcerting to watch a funny movie turn suddenly grim , but whaley's character doesn't have the necessary depth for us to believe the transformation he supposedly undergoes--a transformation that is key to accepting the conclusion . swimming with sharks contains some tremendous scenes . most of these are early in the film , before it takes its bleak detour . certain comments about hollywood are scathing , pointed , and hilarious . unfortunately , there doesn't seem to be enough material here to satisfy a full length feature , and the movie , which starts with such promise , begins to drag around its midpoint . from then on , despite a few brief rallies , the script never regains its early momentum or clarity , and , by the closing credits , swimming with sharks is just treading water . 
1	of course , after such an inauspicious beginning , it would be hard for it get any worse . typical of the lame incidents in the story is the one about the killer dorito . it turns out , instead , to be a shallow cut from a dorito propelled by the hot dog . the hostages want to know whether it is " bbq or cool ranch . " even if it isn't much of a comedy , at least it's a good-spirited one . the cast gives it their all , but the material is hopeless . the movie even fails my grand canyon test . when a film , as held up does , throws in some footage of a beautiful place like the grand canyon in the hopes of giving the production a little class and then makes the site look dull with ugly , washed-out colors , you know the picture is in trouble . it is rated pg-13 for mild profanity and comic violence and would be acceptable for kids around 10 and up . 
1	liam , a lackluster rendition of an angela's ashes-type story by director stephen frears ( high fidelity ) , connects all of the usual dots . just as secular religions like environmentalism are universally acclaimed in films without question , christianity generally appears in movies only to present an easy villain . in liam , the catholic teachers and priests are sadistic figures that make the devil look pretty attractive by comparison . one of the film's themes contrasts christianity and communism , with communism coming out more compassionate . in the movie's least credible part , jews enter the story only so that the movie can boldly beat its chest against both anti-semitism and fascism . most of the story , however , is more tedious and clich ? d than political . it is in jimmy mcgovern's script that most of the problems lie . the acting , with one notable exception , is fine . with a single dour expression , young actor anthony borrows plays liam , a lad of about eight . the over-the-top script feels it necessary to give liam a horrendous stutter , as if his character weren't tragic enough already . the ending to liam is not to be believed . it has one of those horrible and ridiculously improbable ending incidents that occur only as plot devices in movies . if you're looking for a liam-type story , rent the genuine article , angela's ashes , instead . the latter has its problems , but it's much preferable to liam . it is rated r for " some nudity and language " and would be acceptable for teenagers . in the silicon valley , it is showing at the camera cinemas and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
2	the story revolves around relationships that look perfect but aren't , just like the bowl . carrying the bowl metaphor a bit further , this exquisite motion picture itself has a few imperfections , including being about 10 minutes too long . more disconcerting is jeremy northam's jarring italian accent which feels just as fake as his beard , which may be genuine but doesn't look it . still , these are minor quibbles . their movies always look terrific . sometimes , as in the room with a view , they let the look overwhelm the story , but other times , as in the remains of the day and the golden bowl , they come up with a story that's more than a match for the production's lush appearance . several decades ago , the bbc did a mini-series of " the golden bowl , " which was shown on masterpiece theater in america -- the prince , by the way , notes that he is a direct descendant of amerigo vespucci from whence the word america is derived . this television series is a personal favorite of mine , and , even if this film version doesn't quite measure up , it is a wonderful movie in its own right . bad idea . even after maggie knows of her husband's infidelity , she tells charlotte with something sounding like complete sincerity , " i have never thought you anything you but beautiful , wonderful and good .

1	orion pictures has gone to the vault again , dusting off a 1991 production called the favor and giving it an ill-publicized theatrical run . as romantic comedies go , this is perhaps the most original to come along in a while ( keeping in mind that " original " doesn't equate to " best " ) . more novel even that , however , is the subject matter : the nature of " the favor . " on balance , there's almost as much wrong with the favor as there is right , but director donald petrie ( who went on to do grumpy old men ) keeps the tone light and breezy , and that covers many faults . it's so rare to find a pair of solid female characters these days that the eyes of the two leads must have lit up when they read the script . neither kathy nor emily is condescended to in the favor . in fact , on this occasion it's the men who are stereotyped and left half-developed . the most comfortable portions of the movie center around kathy's domestic life . there's no chemistry whatsoever between mcgovern and pitt . while joe is supposed to be annoying , miller plays him in an exaggerated way that clashes violently with the film's generally easygoing attitude . every scene featuring this man turns into sitcom fare--silly , over-the-top , and not especially funny . the movie is still a little rough around the edges , featuring its share of scenes that , for one reason or another , don't work , but the overall effect is one of pleasant entertainment . while not the female equivalent of blake edwards' 10 , the favor may be as close as any film comes . 
0	even after the inert actors in antony hoffman's red planet make their journey there , the count of life forms still appears to be about zip . with an arid landscape that is the spitting image of utah , the tedious movie is about as much fun as a long stroll through a hot utah desert without benefit of water . it seems that earth's resources have been depleted by bad ecological choices , so the planet's inhabitants have decided to colonize mars . if you think that awol algae doesn't sound like a hot recipe for a picture , you'd be right . the good news about the cast is that val kilmer avoids his usual proclivity for overacting with a vengeance . the bad news is that he phones in his part without one scintilla of emotion . actually , the whole cast seems affected by the lighter martian gravity which appears to make time slow down and brains go into idle loops . in order to jazz up this pg-13-rated science fiction tale , writers jonathan lemkin and channing gibson have the commander parade naked and wear tight see-through tops .

2	writer/director john sayles weaves an intriguing story that is both a mystery and a study about the relationship between the generations and the races . this is a slow moving , superbly acted , thoughtful , provocative look at america's past and where it is now , as seen through the past lives of the main characters depicted in the three ethnic communities . the laconic tone of the film and the strong intellect in the script bring so many other things to the table , that the mystery , even though it is followed through and wrapped up , is not quite as important as all the other issues it brings up . the subtle message being that the past must be remembered but it is more important that the future must not be blurred by what already happened and can't be changed . this ambitious project is an engrossing and an original work . there are no predictable and formulaic messages , this is one of the great films of the 1990s , one that is done with wit and tact . everything about it rings with truth , even if it has to break down a few legends to get its point across -- proving that often enough , legends are not all they are cracked up to be . 
2	in irwin winkler's life as a house , one of the very best films of the year , george has some big problems . in an incredibly nuanced and oscar-caliber performance , kevin kline plays george , an average joe who lives in a shack next to multimillion dollar mansions above the pacific ocean . ( in a part worthy of a supporting actress nomination , kristin scott thomas plays robin , george's ex-wife . ) it may make good business sense , but it rips george's heart out . as anyone who has ever lost their job knows , this can be almost unbearably painful . and that isn't even close to the worst thing that happens to george . don't worry , this isn't one of those manipulative disease-movie-of-the-week weepers . you'll certainly find many tearful moments in it , but the marvelous script by mark andrus ( as good as it gets ) is uplifting and funny as well as poignant and honest . the other part comes from the richness of the script , which gives a whole host of featured and minor characters rich stories of their own . in a fairly standard length film , it packs more into the narrative than most miniseries and does it without ever rushing . the actors are marvelous , making each of their problems palpable . robin asks george in a telling , confessional question that has no proper answer . those about him take his weight lost as some sort of fluke . george doesn't even have an indoor shower . all but the most cynical should be moved by the transformation in sam , george , robin and all the rest of characters . this upbeat story is almost as good as the downbeat american beauty . common to both are the richness of their narratives and of all the characters . when it's over , you may be like me . life as a house made such an impression on me that i had trouble moving . what a wonderful story it is . it is rated r for " language , sexuality and drug use " and would be acceptable for teenagers . in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line .

" the movie l . i . e . , by commercial director michael cuesta and co-writers stephen ryder , michael cuesta and gerald cuesta , is about a lot of things . it's a tragic coming of age story . it's a story about restless youth . but what you're most likely to hear is that it is about pedophilia . the movie tries hard not to sensationalize this latter subject , but it doesn't back away from it either . one thing is certain . cuesta is an impressive visual stylist . they just like the momentary thrill of almost being caught . it provides them a drug-like rush that numbs the pain of their self-inflicted boredom . howie , a kid with a confused sexuality , is embarrassed to have never had sex with a girl . big john likes befriending young guys , which is certainly no crime . as big john , brian cox , a veteran actor , would be up for oscar consideration for his acting in this role , except there is probably zero chance of the academy nominating an actor playing a pedophile . you can just imagine what hay an ambitious senator could make with that nomination . the film's only downfall is a needlessly pat ending that makes you wish that they would have made one more pass over the script before they started filming . l . i . e . runs 1 : 48 . it is rated nc-17 for " some explicit sexual content , " and would be acceptable for college students . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
1	screenplay : james toback . director : james toback . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 85 minutes . it should have been a bracing , enthralling experience watching blake's deceptions -- and his very self-created identify -- crumble piece by piece . toback , unfortunately , doesn't let the audience in on the process of figuring this guy out . instead , every possible bit of sub-text is turned into blunt , frequently awkward text . dialogue becomes a steady stream of diagnosis , a " you need everyone to love you " bouncing off of an " i think you want to believe that . " there's even a poster of seminal menage-a-trois film jules et jim on blake's wall to offer insight by conspicuous set decoration . everyone and everything on screen screams at blake exactly what his problem is , giving us barely a moment to consider what _we_ think blake's problem is . that's a near-criminal waste of the complexity and intensity downey pours into his performance . there are clear parallels between this character -- a charming , self-deluding actor -- and downey's own much-publicized inner demons , parallels of which toback was clearly aware when he wrote the script with downey in mind . the film's two most riveting scenes find blake alone with those demons . sadly , this isn't a one-man show . wagner improves as the film progresses , but her opening lines are delivered with such plastic spunkiness that it's hard to avoid loathing her on sight . both actresses , however , are victims of a script which never lets them become characters in their own right . it's baffling that after so much wailing and gnashing of teeth , toback's resolution seems to be that blake isn't really such a bad guy -- that he's not all that different from anybody else , that relationships are all about deception anyway so let's give poor blake a break . i'd conclude that blake's story is much more interesting if he is an entirely unique sort of sexual animal , but toback was generous enough to draw my conclusions for me . given downey's troubled history , it's sad to see blake given such a simplistic freudian out for his behavior . apparently , mommy didn't love him enough . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
0	once upon a time , many years ago when the earth was still young , i read comic books . in fact , i read them quite avidly . i attended comic book conventions , kept my collection in acid-free boxes and bought the overstreet price guide every year . i remember the fervor with which comic book fans defend their favorite characters , and the excitement generated by the first film appearance of a character . my first encounter with this phenomenon from the other side of the philosophical fence came when i dared to give only fleeting praise to 1994's the crow . from the reactions of the film's fans , you would think not only that i had challenged the film's artistic merit , but also that i had performed an excretory act on brandon lee's grave . the idea for the story , i felt , was intriguing , the execution merely competent . and the wrath it raineth down . now i steel myself once again , because folks , spawn ain't even _that_ good . anyone familiar with the crow is going to experience a bit of conceptual deja vu with spawn . at its best , spawn does provide some genuinely eye-catching visual effects for its titular character . spawn's body armor is perfectly rendered , sprouting all manner of computer-generated weaponry and a billowing red cape as necessity demands . leguizamo also provides entertainment value by tossing off crude gags between bouts of flatulence . at its worst , spawn provides the kind of horrid acting often excused in genre films with the description " campy , " with half the cast ( white , sheen , leguizamo ) doing gutteral line readings ( because the forces of evil always talk like mercedes mccambridge in " the exorcist " ) and the other half ( randle , williamson , d . b . sweeney ) standing around looking befuddled . it also offers a decidedly sony play station vision of hell , and a script which doesn't bother to give the main character a life before it gives him an afterlife . most of the time , however , spawn is neither at its best nor at its worst . it is merely redundant , a now-familiar plot of gloom-soaked heroism decked out with the expected trappings of perpetually rainy alleys , gothic spires and a couple of explosions . i'm not familiar enough with the time line of recent comics to know whether " the crow " pre-dated " spawn " in comic book form , but it doesn't really matter . viewers of spawn may find a few new and improved special effects , but everything else is re-used and recycled ; even leguizamo's performance as clown seems like a slightly more scatalogical spin on nicholson's joker . comic books may have picked up a certain improbable cachet when they started referring to themselves as " graphic novels , " but that attitude has merely resulted in a different kind of creative rut . it's like graphic grunge rock , where an energetic and invigorating first wave has given way to endless imitators who can't seem to lighten up and stop whining . even when screenwriter alan mcelroy tries to temper the angst with glib quips , the result is something strictly for fans of the new and improved special effects . or , perhaps , for die-hard spawn fans who may be preparing an effigy of yours truly even as we speak . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
0	what more could the viewing public want ? believability would be nice . absent that , perhaps a mystery that goes somewhere . in a film that has only one even mildly interesting performance and where the other characters are created out of cardboard , it helps if you approach the chamber with as low an expectation as possible to avoid disappointment . having read " the chamber " and all of the other john grisham books , i entered the theater not expecting a lot , but it was considerable worse than i feared . in the hands of director james foley and screenwriters william goldman and chris reese , they manage to take the least of enjoyable author grisham's novels and excise its only strength which is the mystery . although they do leave an outline of the mystery , what is left is like a maze where someone has erased most of the dividing lines . the film plays like it was a four hour movie where all of the key sections have been purged to get it down to size . only the dull parts and the sensation portions have been left intact . the characters don't relate to each other . rather than chemistry between them , what we get is a string of serial monologues masquerading as a script . there are many fine pictures that discuss the subjects in the chamber in a responsible and enlightening manner . foley's vision here is limited to the exploitive . he takes controversial subjects and taunts the audience with racial and religious epithets solely for gratuitous shock value . ever reliable hackman does the only real acting in the show , but even he is not as good as he usually is . directors and writers do make a difference . the south in the chamber is even more stereotyped than most grisham novels . caricature is effective to a point , but the chamber is way over the line . " save me . sure . i will not discuss the ending other than to say it is as manipulative as the rest of the film . ian baker's cinematography is dull and lifeless . for a major motion picture , it is strikingly ugly . the music by carter burwell sounds like it was lifted from an old b movie . i left the theater with many questions . how could they make such a incredible mistake as to cast chris o'donnell as the lawyer ? why was the script such an insult to the viewer's intelligence ? and the biggest question of all , why did i stay , hoping in vain that the film would somehow get better ? the chamber runs forever at 1 : 51 thanks to the sloppy editing of mark warner . it is rated r for some violence and some bad language , and the film would probably be acceptable for teenagers . i hated the show , and i recommend people of all ages avoid it . only out of respect for gene hackman do i award it a single * . my immediate reaction when i left the theater was not even to rate it that high . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	out of respect for the stunning visuals and family entertainment value of disney's 34th animated feature , i can do no less than recommend the hunchback of notre dame . sadly , however , this is the least- enjoyable animated feature to come from the studio since its 1989 rebirth . the hunchback of notre dame is a notch below last year's pocahontas , which , in turn , was a drop from the previous year's the lion king . still , all things considered , the hunchback of notre dame isn't bad , it's just a little disappointing . despite the over-hyped and overexaggerated " darkness " of the production , kids will love it , so a box office success is assured . and those who carefully review the family entertainment competition this summer will rightfully conclude that hunchback is the surest bet . it's curious that the movie to use the most adult source material has yielded the least potent results . obviously , victor hugo's vision of the hunchback of notre dame couldn't be made into a disney cartoon -- it violates almost every aspect of the studio's traditional , feel- good/happy ending formula . so , predictably , the screenwriters diluted it , but , in doing so , they siphoned off the elements that give the story its unique power . with the darkest and most unpleasant aspects of hugo's tragedy eradicated , there's not much left . the poorly-focused remains are likely to appeal most strongly to the under-12 crowd . unlike past efforts , there aren't many in-jokes and double-entendres to catch the attention of the adults in the audience . the film loosely follows hugo's narrative . in hugo's book , the interaction between these characters fuels a complex and multi- layered drama . for , although we come to feel for " quasi " , neither esmeralda nor phoebus makes a dent in our sympathy . he's not monstrous or ugly ; he's just different . children who consider themselves oddballs or outcasts will likely identify with the hunchback . and the life-lesson about tolerance and respect for others will be understood by nearly everyone who watches the film . according to disney , frollo is the most conflicted and complex villain to have ever been brought to the animated screen . i suppose that's true on one level -- after all , he's tormented by his own lustful impulses , and acts out of religious zeal rather than plain nastiness -- but i doubt many viewers will notice . ultimately , frollo comes across as a bigoted , intolerant , but not overly-frightening , bad guy . the most impressive thing about him is tony jay's deep , resonant voice . from a musical standpoint , the hunchback of notre dame is lifeless . the songs , co-written by composer alan menken and lyricist stephen schwartz , lack energy . there are no show-stopping , toe-tapping numbers . in fact , there's nothing remotely memorable about any aspect of hunchback's soundtrack -- it's easily the poorest effort to come from menken since he started churning out scores for disney ( he's done all of the new wave animated features except the lion king ) . on the other hand , the animation is crisper and more impressive than anything since beauty and the beast , and certain computer-aided sequences are even more eye-popping than beauty's sterling ballroom scene . the festival of fools , where quasimodo first ventures out of the bell tower , is a riot of color and movement , with intricately-animated backgrounds that are more interesting than the foregrounds . if you believe that the primary purpose for animated films is to enthrall children , the hunchback of notre dame is an unquestionable success . if you're looking for entertainment for the whole family , this movie will fit the bill . but if you're anticipating something that's as diverting for adults as for younger viewers , hunchback may disappoint . since the release of the little mermaid , disney has set a high standard for its animated work , and , for the first time , one of the studio's releases struggles to distinguish itself . 
1	the opening credits of dangerous beauty , thankfully , say the story is true -- it's based on margaret rosenthal's biography " the honest courtesan . " were it not true , as it claims to be so , the frequently ridiculous , silly plot would have had the audiences laughing at all the wrong places . we learn , for example , that most women of that era , with the exception of courtesans , were not able to read . for those of you who have trouble suspending disbelief in movies , this film may short-circuit your brain . jeannine dominy's screenplay adaptation takes a modern language approach , laced with poetry , that might be termed shakespeare-lite , so there are ample opportunities to ridicule the picture if you are so inclined . but don't get me wrong , as filmed in a romantic haze by bojan bazelli and as sumptuously decorated by norman garwood , the production dazzles the eyes at every turn . even more dazzling and bizarre is the film's opening . ( this much nudity so early in a picture is not a good sign . ) the script likes to include advice , witty and bawdy . the movie has the potential to become a camp classic . although the costumes look authentic , especially the ridiculous eight-inch platform shoes that the courtesans wear , the simple make-up looks exactly like what you see on the street today . she has a book published of her poetry and engages the men in duels of poetry , sometimes lewd but more often not . as absurd as it is at times , the movie , directed by marshall herskovitz from the tv series " my so-called life , " can be quite cute . and with its full plate of romance , jealousy , humor , titillation and even a bit of pathos , it tries to please everyone . but the ending scene , which you've seen a hundred times before , neatly wraps it all up . although parts of the picture are enjoyable , the characters never rise above playacting . like some ribald tale from the playboy channel but with most of the sex scenes edited out , the movie is never sure what it wants to be . it's certainly not soft porn , but neither is it is very substantial . it is rated r for nudity , sex and profanity and would be acceptable for teenagers if they are both older and mature . 
1	a rehashed formula action/sci-fi film about the near future that looks old hat and plays like low-brow entertainment even as it advances the sophisticated problems cloning might eventually hold . maybe it's because the film tried to be both preachy about its social conscience message and at the same time your typical arnold schwarzenegger action film , that it looked so confused , seeming as fuzzy and as unbelievable as the instant cloning process it featured in the film . but , as for the film's entertainment value , it passes the test for mild escapist fare , and to the bargain you have two arnold's saying lame one-liners for the price of one . but , even if this film is not as good as his " total recall " or " true lies " or even " terminator 2 , " it should be good enough to be accepted by his loyal following . how it will do in the box office and with the general public , is hard to say , as the film seems gloomily cluttered with nocturnal shots and the action is less than spectacular , and it is not as stylish as some other recent popular action films ( eg . and , how the public will respond to the aging arnold saving the world from an evil clone manufacturer who is merely a greedy businessman and not a super-villain , in a pg-13 film without an edge , is anyone's guess , especially since arnold's popularity is slipping . in this film he is asked to carry the load , though helped somewhat that the film is well executed , has good enough special effects and a semi-plausible cloning theme . but , he still cannot overcome the overall mediocrity of the film . for its thought provoking moments , the film wants to draw its battlelines over good science vs . bad science , showing how drucker's corporation greedily makes money off science and profits greatly from its illegal operation . philosophy is not one of the film's strong points , as there is a muddled argument for each position presented . for him , there is nothing higher than human love . he's the most interesting one in the film , so it behooves me that he has a truncated part , which fails to give him the depth needed to draw out his character and go further than the drab figure he is portrayed as , being a good scientist used by an evil businessman . " we have a lifetime contract with a vegetable . the joke being , that you don't have to die , the corporation can clone you in no time at all ( hardly believable ) , if they have your genetic code , and the cost is a only mere one and a half million bucks . it's all been seen before , but the film seems easy to take or leave , and is only mildly offensive to both those who like their films with a bit more intelligence and those who prefer a lot more rough action . this film will live and die not by its story , but by what you think of its action scenes . i thought they were good enough in a functional sense , but there were just too many dead spots in the story for me to find this big-budget film anything more than a minor work . 
0	a far-fetched and schmaltzy hollywood-style mainstream tale about time travel . to buy into this half-baked sci-fi wannabe , one has to have a suspension of disbelief and of all rational thought . if the catch-the-killer subplot had any real suspense to it , i might have bit more for this nonsense storyline . but that thriller part doesn't even hold up with your average tv detective show . but this story is unfortunately overtaken by its weak serial killer story . thereby , the film is reduced to overreaching its credibility by confusingly switching back and forth between past and future events , sloppily changing one for the other , until nothing made sense , since you have to keep changing both simultaneously to alter both dimensions and the film fails to accomplish that storyline with accurate details . the acting was surprisingly good , despite the poor script . dennis quaid is a throwback father -- one that many a child would gladly appreciate . if the film did one thing right , it showed a family that was really together and good to see on the screen , especially with all the recent films mostly showing only dysfunctional families . it was refreshing to see one for a change with a father as a good role model , even if some might find this relationship too corny . gregory hoblit ( primal fear/fallen ) has fallen into the trap of going overboard in his use of sentimentality , which overtakes the film and makes it too gooey for comfort . also , his directing suffers from an inability to tell a good detective story , even if his idea on time travel is intriguing . unfortunately , the time travel story does not hold up to any intelligent scrutiny . so what is left , is a movie that should find its own audience with those who find the father/son relationship meaningful and find the time travel concept to be entertaining . 
2	well , pierce got the job , not arnold , but for those who wondered what a muscle-bound austrian 007 might be like , take a look at true lies . only here , the name's tasker . i have yet to decide whether true lies is a better comedy or action film . it contains heavy elements of both , and plays them equally well . unlike such failed attempts as hudson hawk and last action hero , however , true lies is a big , grandiose movie that has an immense amount of fun while never taking itself too seriously . a slightly shorter running time might have been appreciated ( one-hundred forty minutes is too long for even a very good action film ) , but overall , i don't have many complaints . titles like the terminator and aliens speak volumes about his talent . his least original film , t2 , was still a rollicking good time , if a little limited when it came to a plot . now , with true lies , the director has not only reaffirmed his ability to keep viewers on the edge of their seats , but he has shown himself capable of making an audience laugh . one of the best things about true lies is that it's genuinely funny . the storyline isn't really all that inventive , although it contains a few original moments . the point of true lies is enjoyment . the plot is a little meatier than that of speed , but , until the last forty-five minutes , it doesn't thunder along at nearly the same breakneck pace . in fact , the main " terrorist-blackmailing-the-world " story stays in low gear until the film is ninety minutes along . as enjoyable as the harry/helen proceedings are , they start to drag . what begins as great comic relief grows tiresome before it gives way to something else . after all , with actors of the limited scope of schwarzenegger and curtis , there's little hope of anything dramatic coming out of this part of the movie . tom arnold is probably not many people's idea of arnold schwarzenegger's ideal sidekick ( uh oh , i've got too " arnolds " in this review--how to keep them straight . . . ? ) . surprisingly , however , his wisecracking character works . had this been a serious film , roseanne's hubby would have been hopelessly out-of-place , but amidst all the multi-million dollar foolery , he's at home . comic relief is his job , and he does it admirably . this is , after all , an arnold schwarzenegger motion picture , and certain things are expected . it certainly delivers a lot more than last action hero did . true lies is an old-fashioned , high-tech , fun time at the movies . by not trying to " out-die hard " die hard , and relying instead on its own brand of mayhem and humor , this movie has injected some much-needed freshness into a genre that always threatening to turn stale . in combination , speed and true lies deliver a summer one-two punch that will leave viewers squirming with excitement and gasping for breath . as for arnold , even though he doesn't say it this time around , we all know that he'll be back . . . 
2	screenplay : peter howitt . director : peter howitt . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 105 minutes . how much does that one , seemingly inconsequential variable change the woman's life ? sliding doors is a gimmick film , the gimmick being that it allows us to watch both alternate courses determined by that one moment . sliding doors works on enough different levels that i wonder whether it succeeds because of its gimmick or in spite of it . as a straightforward relationship comedy , it's generally delightful , crafted by writer/director peter howitt with unusually sharp comic dialogue . the principal characters are uniformly well-drawn , from the unsteady confidence of paltrow's helen , to the genial wit of hannah's james , to the confused and almost sympathetic philandering of lynch's gerry . even a minor supporting performance from douglas mcferran as james' no-nonsense best friend shines with energy and humor . howitt explores familiar modern romance territory , but does it with enough intelligence and commitment to the characters that it feels fresh . of course , he's also playing an extended game of " what if " , one which sometimes intrudes on the perfectly enjoyable conventional narrative . though rookie director howitt handles the interplay between the story-lines with surprising deftness , the shifts from one plot to the other often deny both plots momentum . nowhere is this more evident than during a pair of climactic confrontations , where howitt cuts back and forth to the point of distraction . he may be intending to build tension , but instead he builds frustration , using neck-stapping editing to show the pivotal moments occurring simultaneously while sacrificing dramatic urgency . a version of sliding doors which offered a simple , smartly-written romantic triangle might have been just as winning without all the fuss . it's also true that something would have been lost . though at first glance sliding doors seems to flirt with the celebration of fate and destiny so popular in recent love stories , howitt offers something a bit more thought-provoking than that . by allowing us to get to know the characters -- and helen in particular -- as well as he does , he gives us much more reason to believe that destiny is simply the tendency of people to act according to their character . helen's determination , pride and sense of self-worth are what make it likely that any course of her life will have a happy ending , not the capricious opening or closing of a pair of sliding doors on a train . the film may be a bit of speculative gimmickry , but it's also something more -- and less -- than that . in some alternate reality , peter howitt may have made sliding doors a romantic comedy without a gimmick . like helen's life , it's hard to know for sure which version would have been more engaging and appealing . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
1	screenplay : david twohy . director : deran sarafian . most of the time , i see a new movie on its opening weekend , and it's not just so that my reviews can be fairly fresh . such was not the case with terminal velocity , which had the chance to accumulate a mountain of negative response in the two weeks between its opening and my screening . it's difficult to preduct how those pre-conceptions will affect my own reaction . in this case , they allowed me to be pleasantly surprised . terminal velocity is frenetic and uneven , but it has a certain bone-headed charm thanks to charlie sheen's improbably dense hero . sheen plays richard " ditch " brody , a skydiving instructor with something of a reckless streak . the plot of terminal velocity is not exactly what you would call inspired ; it's basically classic hitchcock crossed with classic james bond . the plot's few twists and turns are spelled out in huge letters from the outset , and a bit clumsy in the execution . equally distracting is a tone which careens from brutal to near slapstick in moments , making for a schizophrenic experience which isn't as purely enjoyable as it might be . director deran sarafian drives the action forward relentlessly , which is usually an ideal choice for a film of this genre , but often seems merely hyperactive here . terminal velocity sometimes feels like a cockroach race -- moving fast , but in no particular direction . its saving graces are the characterizations and interaction of charlie sheen and nastassja kinski . sheen's ditch brody is just a handful of brain celss removed from his goofball hot shots ! persona , but it's a character that comes off as extremely refreshing in an action thriller . rather than being either inordinately brilliant or dumber than virtually everyone in the audience , ditch is just simple . he is quite entertaining in scenes where he is infuriated by kinski's references to his dim-wittedness , but he maintains a kind of affable puppy-dog eagerness to please . it's a simple gesture , but funny because it's clear this is no rocket scientist we're dealing with . that rescue , a wildly inventive stunt , is certainly terminal velocity's highlight . it's a gag worthy of the best bond films , and it sends terminal velocity off on a note of high energy . but it's not an isolated moment . terminal velocity is full of well-staged action sequences , and twohy's dialogue is rich with fine one-liners . though it sometimes seems a bit too busy and scattershot for its own good , it's still a perfectly enjoyable no-brainer worth a few solid laughs . 
0	this is the last film made by the celebrated italian neorealist . it was an unbearably dull and simplistic film : poorly acted and with a vile and inaccurate depiction of jews , the scenery consisted of gaudy tv stage sets , and there was just no emotion drawn from the story . it was so badly done , that it seemed like all the figures were wooden . it therefore doesn't surprise me that this film was rarely seen , even in europe , the producers were probably happy to bury it . rossellini showed his love for film as an amateur by making short subject films . this was strictly a propaganda film and il duce's son was the film's supervisor . he made a few more fascist-commissioned films and in 1943 he shot desiderio , which was a precursor of his trademarked neorealist style to come later . together they made stromboli ( 49 ) , a film that i liked very much and thought it was underrated . he also made strangers in 1953 , which might be the best film he made during this period . the romans are made to seem like benign rulers , only too glad to please the jews and grant them their wish . the cruelty of the romans was never even hinted at . rossellini also took the religion out of jesus and made the rabbi seem as if he was merely a moralist , who was more a humanitarian and a mr . nice guy than anything else . i found this a difficult film to find anything in it that was praiseworthy . the director was trying to go back to film in his neorealism style , but couldn't even come close to duplicating the passionate films he is best remembered for . this film is only for those who feel compelled to see all of rossellini's films from 1936-1978 , the good , the bad , and the ugly . 
2	screenplay : robert king . director : mick jackson . when i stepped into the theater to see clean slate , i had yet to see any evidence that dana carvey might actually be capable of acting . in fact , he seemed incapable of anything but the broadest schtick . his " saturday night live " characters were usually caricatures , and the wayne's world films and the horrible opportunity knocks simply regurgitated those characters . so it qualifies as one of the most unexpected surprises of the year that clean slate turns out to be an absolutely delightful comedy . as improbable as the concept might seem , director mick jackson ( the bodyguard ) reins in carvey's tendency towards excess and gives him a real character to work with , and the chance to generate big laughs . clean slate is so full of unpredictable pleasures that it's difficult to know where to begin . the greatest is probably the performance of carvey , in a role analagous in many ways to bill murray's in groundhog day . the nature of pogue's condition inevitably limits his character development , but merely watching carvey react to that situation is endlessly entertaining . but there is virtually nothing about clean slate which isn't quirky , off-handed and charming . director jackson complements the weirdness with visual throwaways like the neck brace james earl jones' character wears with a hole for his tie to come through , and the band-aid carvey sports through out the film . clean slate is that rare comedy which simply never goes exactly where you expect it to go . all this would be quite enough to recommend clean slate , but it also provides a neatly-polotted little mystery . occasionally it feels as though king and jackson are trying to throw in a bit too much ( the character of pogue's ex-wife is particularly unnecessary ) , which sidetracks the film's energy . however , at the end of clean slate i was left without a single plausibility problem . in the 24 hours since i saw clean slate , bits and pieces have popped into my head constantly , prompting spontaneous laughter , and it just keeps growing on me . it wouldn't be surprising , given carvey's track record and an advertising campaign which can't do it justice , to see clean slate make a quick exit from theaters . then again , there might just be one more surprise coming . 
1	director betty thomas ( private parts ) and writer susannah grant ( erin brockovich ) have more affinity for the comedic part of the story , but it is the tragic that is the most effective . the comedic , which only works in fits and spurts , serves more often as a detriment to the movie than an attribute . another problem with the picture is that we've seen it before and better . michael keaton in clean and sober was funnier and more chillingly convincing . and the frighteningly effective performance by meg ryan in when a man loves a woman put both movies shame . we get a brief glimpse at the movie's start of how much fun gwen has when wasted . this conflict between the sisters is the most promising and most underdeveloped part of the storyline . in an inspired bit of casting against type , steve buscemi plays gwen's counselor . his effect on her life appears as if it will be significant , but the movie only gives us a few cheap laughs before moving on . although interrupted periodically by genuine tragedy ( puking in the toilet from drug withdrawal , attempted suicides , ugly relapses , etc . ) , the movie spends most of its time and energy in search of laughs . most of the comedy troop seem lifted from some lame television sitcom . sometimes the movie successfully blends the comedic with the tragic . after choosing to show that time for gwen , the filmmakers made it seem way too easy for her . as simple as that . it is rated pg-13 for mature thematic elements involving substance abuse , language and some sensuality and would be acceptable for teenagers . 
1	featuring the voices of donna akersten , stuart devenie , mark hadlow , ross jolly , brian sergent , peter vere jones , and mark wright director : peter jackson producers : jim booth and peter jackson screenplay : danny mulheron , frances walsh , stephen sinclair , and peter jackson cinematography : murray milne puppets designed by cameron chittock music : peter dasent u . s . distributor : greycat films and now for something completely different . . . . those not specifically on the lookout for this film will probably miss meeting the feebles , which may be a good thing , considering the potentially-horrified reaction of someone who unwittingly walks into a theater showing this feature . to the outside world , the stars of " the fabulous feebles variety hour " television special are celebrities worthy of adoration , but those who spend time behind-the-scenes know the real story . the feebles are engaged in every kind of depravity imaginable , from pornography to homicidal shooting sprees . the stories of these and a few other characters are told in a disgustingly graphic , obscenely offbeat , and caustically funny manner . meet the feebles is for those with a strong stomach and a seriously warped sense of humor . the film is so off the beaten track that it makes monty python seem mainstream . anyone attracted by the promise of an earlier effort from the director of heavenly creatures should avoid precipitously rushing out to see this ; the only link between the two films is the undeniable creative genius of peter jackson . the mood of the viewer goes a long way to determining how much enjoyment is culled from meet the feebles . it probably helps to watch this film with a group of like-minded individuals , perhaps after imbibing a little too much alcohol . calling this film " bizarre " is far too tame--it's sick , ribald , and willing to try just about anything . that makes for a nearly-unprecedented monument to bad taste . sounds a little like something by john waters , doesn't it ? it should be noted that grossing people out isn't the only objective of meet the feebles . despite being buried beneath copious quantities of body fluids and other revolting material , jackson's film contains a satirical message about not objectifying media stars . this movie was created some seven years ago , yet it doesn't take much stretch of the imagination to relate it to certain current high-profile news stories . how different is the feebles' three ring circus from that of the o . j . meet the feebles is the sort of movie you either love or hate . personally , while i found parts of it diabolically clever and funny , i thought the setup was overlong and certain aspects of the production either didn't work or were needlessly overdone . but that's the kind of style that turns something like this into a cult favorite , so take the numerical rating with a significant grain of salt . regardless of your opinion of meet the feebles , however , it's unlikely that , after seeing this film , you'll ever look at kermit or miss piggy in quite the same way . 
2	the joy luck club , as stated in the movie's opening narrative , is a collection of four aging chinese women bound together more by hope than by joy or luck . since i didn't count , i can't verify this statement , but it sounds about right . taken as a whole , all of these vignettes combine to lend greater meaning to the whole . the joy luck club is the sum total of its parts with common themes giving solid grounding and greater resonance to the overall film . as bass comments , " i saw all the mothers' and daughters' stories as facets of the same experience . that's the genius of the book , and if we cut it down to just a couple of stories it would be like any other movie . " the stories are not told in such a manner as to seem pared down or truncated , nor is their presentation confusing , thanks to a cleverly- orchestrated framing scene with the principal characters gathered together . however , it is apparent that a lot more could have been told , and we're left wondering about all that we didn't get to see . the characters are mostly well-developed , but it's tantalizing to consider just how much fuller some of them could have been with a different plot structure . but there are always sacrifices to be made , and no movie can tell everything about the lives of the people it introduces . one of the themes of sleepless in seattle is that there are some " guy movies " and some " chick movies . " if this is true , then the joy luck club fits into the latter category . certainly , a tear-jerker like this is likely to find more open acceptance among women than among men . that's not necessarily because men won't like it , but some will be too embarrassed to admit that they enjoyed something as emotional as this . in fact , there are those who may refuse to see it to avoid this possible dilemma altogether . nevertheless , there will be a group of people who will genuinely dislike the joy luck club , and i can't say that their reasoning is entirely flawed . the movie has a few moments that can justifiably be described as cloying and manipulative , and those who are offended by these methods are going to become annoyed at the joy luck club . die-hard cynics are advised to stay clear . what the aforementioned people have missed , however , is that the scenes that don't work are far fewer in number than those that do , and most of these can easily be overlooked in piecing together the overall intent of the motion picture . few movies are without at least a problem or two , and it's more difficult to put together a flawless production when going for the emotional payoffs that this film does . the joy luck club is clearly--perhaps too clearly--an adaptation of a book . the dialogue is often too poetic to be real , and the story too clearly plotted to be acceptable as anything more than an imperfect reflection of the world we live in . i hasten to add that this is not a bad thing , but it is evidence that this movie , through its willingness to loosen the strings of realism , expects a certain suspension of disbelief from the audience . personally , i never identified with any of the characters , but i became involved in their stories . that is to say , never did i make a connection between something in my own life and what i was seeing on screen , but that in no way diminished the impact of what was being presented . i venture to say that many women , especially those who have had tempestuous relationships with their mothers or daughters , will have an entirely different viewpoint . the line between drama and melodrama is a fine one , and most of the joy luck club successfully navigates the tightrope , staying on the more powerful dramatic side . there are times when it slips and comes across as heavy-handed . you know something isn't right when it becomes apparent that certain lines of dialogue and character actions are trying desperately to make you , as a member of the audience , shed a tear . whether or not these incidents do what they're trying to is another matter entirely . . . . wayne wang , whose best-known previous film was dim sum , shows significant ability in the way he has structured this movie . many are played by more than one actor ( as children then adults , for example ) , but all changes are smooth and seamless . it's as easy to accept a little girl as waverly as it is the beautiful , sophisticated-looking tamlyn tomita , and that's because the characters transcend the performers portraying them . it's fascinating and satisfying the way that the diverse threads are knitted together into a single tapestry . some might complain that this movie is a downer , but those who do , fail to recognize that the joy luck club's message is one of hope , and that catharsis and emotional fulfillment often come through tragedy . sure , a lot of bad things happen during the course of this film , but at the end , the tears are of happiness and new beginnings , not loss . 
2	one hallmark of great cinema is that , even when the story is tragic , a viewer can leave the theater both reflective and satisfied . jude , michael winterbottom's ambitious , big-screen adaptation of thomas hardy's heartbreaking classic , jude the obscure , fits perfectly into that category . this is a film of tremendous scope and emotional depth that uncovers the soul of a novel and brings it to life on the screen . in every way that matters , jude is faithful to its print inspiration . the rhythm of some of the dialogue has been changed to make it sound more natural to contemporary viewers , and a number of minor characters have been deleted , but the story arc is rigorously true to hardy's vision . one of the great strengths of the novel is that it centers on two believable , sympathetic characters . jude effectively captures not only their humanity , but their uniqueness , fashioning a delicate rapport between them and the audience . for a widescreen period piece , jude is surprisingly subtle in presenting its setting . any time you study the background , you'll be confronted with all the appropriate late-19th century surroundings , but the film is so deeply character-oriented that its easy to forget that we're looking back in time . with one very important exception , there are no scenes designed to specifically highlight time and place . that lone exception happens early in the film . jude couldn't have been more perfectly cast . for a while , that's the existence of a scholar , then , for the bulk of the film , it's a life with sue . eccleston gets us to care about jude , a development that is critical to the film's success . their initial sexual encounter is both funny and touching . the film makers indicate that they chose her because she's " easy to fall in love with " , but the strength of her performance far outstrips her natural charisma . winslet was nominated for a best supporting actress oscar for her role in 1995's sense and sensibility ; what she does for sue in jude is both more sublime and more noteworthy . the emotional intensity of jude rivals that of films like carrington and the remains of the day . the honesty of the story and the faithfulness of the production are two key factors why . but top notch production values and strong performances aren't the only reasons for jude's success . more important than even these critical elements is the universality of the sad , unforgettable love story that thomas hardy first told , and michael winterbottom has so effectively re-interpreted . 
2	" i wonder if i'll ever know what it's like to not break up with someone , " laments amelia ( catherine keener ) . and , while the two women's romantic entanglements are part of the story , it's the chemistry between them that keeps the film on the right track . walking and talking is real . it's also , by turns , funny , charming , and even a little touching . holofcener has an ear for dialogue , and , as is often the case with the best character-centered films , a chief pleasure is simply enjoying what the participants have to say to one another . each has mastered the knack of giving a completely unforced performance . once they step into character , they never slip out . walking and talking successfully navigates a minefield of familiar territory . the storyline , which is essentially a slice-of-life , doesn't attempt anything big , but it offers a number of small surprises . just when you think you know how one romantic entanglement is going to turn out , holofcener throws in a little twist . that's not to say that the plot is masterful ( in fact , it's rather simple ) , but there's enough there to hold the viewer's interest . then there's andrew , amelia's screwed-up best male friend . while walking and talking is pretty light fare , it's not without substance . they're afraid of change , even though they recognize it's inevitable , and each suffers from the typical generation x lack of self-esteem . walking and talking ends by giving us closure without wrapping everything up in a neat package . because the main characters are both women , the writer/director is a woman , and the themes relate to female bonding , this will inevitably be pegged as a " chick flick . " that's an unfortunate appellation , because walking and talking has universal appeal . many of the issues it approaches have less to do with gender than with the simple condition of living in the '90s -- something we are all afflicted with . 
2	that's the premise for deceiver , a new thriller from the pate brothers , jonas and josh , who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave . deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not- so-bright cops ( captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland's iq is 151 ; by contrast , kennesaw's is 122 and braxton's is 102 ) . other plot elements are thrown in for good measure . wayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can , in stressful situations , render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent . deceiver , which mostly transpires in a dimly-lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue , has the feel of a david mamet play : edgy , claustrophobic , and tense . the atmosphere is explosive , and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting . deceiver has the power to grab an audience . unfortunately , in the end , it succumbs to the need to throw in one last , unexpected twist , and this is its undoing . for , while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers , it also stretches our credulity too much , and raises more questions than it answers . it's only an effective wrap-up if you don't think too carefully about its full implications . of course , the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic . police procedure is totally ignored and it's almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner . but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction , not plot details . the most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice-over by visually showing what really happened . moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks . the movie , obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir , drips atmosphere . there are some fascinating stylistic touches ; for example , although the setting is contemporary , all of the telephones are old-fashioned , rotary models . cinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver's look . some of the things he tries ( mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow ) work exceptionally well , while others ( like any of several lazy susan shots ) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks . as wayland , tim roth gives the film's top performance , despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting . roth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he's supposed to be . both play their characters like familiar types . penn's performance is uninspired ; rooker's lacks subtlety . some of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors . renee zellweger , in a role that's miles away from her star-making turn in jerry maguire , brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature . rosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw's wife , and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who's entrusted with evaluating wayland's condition . one of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience . plot points aren't hammered home , and , although the ending has its weaknesses , everything isn't spelled out in bold letters . the pates give audience members credit for having brains , which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers . occasionally gripping and never uninteresting , deceiver is a fine noir effort . - ingmar bergman 
1	with its goofy premise , charming stars , and inoffensive humor , i . q . is likely to delight those who frequent movie theaters in search of romantic comedies . anyone who wants a little more from a film won't find it here , however . i . q . is inappropriately titled--cute and lighthearted it may be , but it definitely isn't clever or intelligent . through the first hour , i . q . is pleasant , carried by the chemistry of its leads . ryan , with her wide-eyed gaze and characteristic head tilt , and robbins , with his jimmy stewart-like , low-key style , work well together . it's only in the movie's final third , when an increasingly absurd and disjointed plot surfaces , that the screen presence of the pair is no longer sufficient . matthau is okay as einstein , fitting most people's preconception of a doddering genius . altogether , these intellectual giants act much like the four stooges , and are responsible for a fair share of i . q . 's comedy . fortunately , fry plays his charge as such a stuffed shirt that we don't care . this leads to the film's funniest lowbrow scene--a multiple choice intelligence test with the four old men finding a way for ed to cheat--but it also devolves proceedings to a sit-com level . technical inaccuracies and anachronisms abound , some of which are a little too obvious to miss . how much these annoy the individual viewer will likely depend on how spellbound he or she is by the film's dubious web of magical romance . towards the end of the film , einstein advises catherine , " keep your sense of wonder " and " don't let your brain interfere with your heart . " those , apparently , are mottoes director fred schepisi hopes his audience will bear in mind when watching i . q . the reason is obvious : thinking is not the way to get the most out of this uneven picture . the above represents the opinions of the author , and not necessarily those of bellcore or any organization within bellcore . 
2	mckellar goes for the smaller private moments rather than a grand philosophical argument about the meaning of life or a catastrophic special effect ending . the focus of the film isn't on any sort of biblical apocalypse , nor is it on the outside revellers and looters , or on those who gather in the city square to make it a new year's eve celebration , but it is on those who think out what they want to do and plan to spend a thoughtful evening preparing for the end . the wheeler family uses the catastrophe as an excuse to make this a christmas celebration , believing that even if it isn't christmas that day was the most memorable one for the family and the day of the year they most fondly remember . the sardonic humor and clever performances by sandra oh , don mckellar and callum keith rennie , leave a lasting impression . sandra and don make their experiences seem so vitally human , while callum remains the eternal materialist . the premise is a question that many people have asked themselves , as i recall parties where the game played was to say how you would like to die , and the responses were always so varied and revealing . 
1	an uneven story that moves in fits and spurts , it has trouble ever quite deciding what it wants to be . not a romance , per se , although there is an obligatory sex scene , which is both brief and bland , the film is more of an exploration of two characters' lives . catch , for example , may or may not be alive . one thing is certain , the movie is in no rush to get wherever it is going . the line feels rather like a lecture to the audience to stop being impatient . at its best , the movie can drive home some excellent points with the best of these showing how a single moment in one's life can be so incredibly precious or tragic . but the proof of the story's effectiveness comes in the end . catch and sharon each have what are obviously designed to be three-hankie scenes , but both leave you completely dry-eyed . one thing is certain , you can't fault the acting since it is splendid throughout . it is rated r for language , violence and a scene of sexuality and would be acceptable for teenagers . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
0	there's something whimsical to be said about universal-international's most strained sci-fi film of the 1950s , it sunk to new lows to get to its subject matter . in this heavy-handed message film , the main theme depicts how intolerant people could be who hide behind their religious beliefs blindly and continue to keep others ignorant of the truth . the adventure was clumsily made and was too pedantic to be good cinema . the acting was stiff and the special effects were cheesy . but somehow there was fun to be had in all this under the earth nonsense . 
0	celebrity is like an amalgam of old woody allen materials , which has always given him an opening to concentrate on being witty and ignoring such filmmaking details as editing and plot . this fluff film ( no pretense at ingmar bergman depths here ) could have been funny but it isn't , except in brief spots . as far as being insightful about the " horses arses " who are into being celebrities without any other accomplishments to their credit , there's not really too much to be said that could be profound about that subject matter , it is obvious how shallow a fate just being a celebrity is . woody makes a stronger statement in the film's subplot that deals with love , as he believes that meeting the right mate is mostly a matter of luck . here kenneth branagh is not woody allen , but he plays woody and it doesn't work out that well . he's just not funny , all he's got down pat are woody's voice inflections and neurotic gestures . it's as if he is a robot who looks the part but can't really be the part because he is isn't humanly programed that way . if woody played that scene , it most probably would have been funny , but with branaugh , it seemed pathetically flat and unfunny . donald trump is buying st . patrick's cathedral and tearing-it-down for a skyscraper . celebrities give trite comments to banal questions , such as , " what do you think of the rain ? " " it's really something ! " the beautifully shot b/w film ends as it begins , as a plane passes overhead with the skywriting word " help ! " this was a film that had no idea how to put this story together , it seemed so lifeless and flat , indeed , in need of help . for starters , none of the main characters were cast right , and especially branaugh : there's no way , no matter how exact his mimicry of woody is , that he can be thought of as a neurotic , nebbish , nyc jew . what was needed was some originality and some energy into making the characters appear absurdly funny and not carbon copy imitations of how celebrities are . the few jokes in the film were far and few between , and could not overcome the tired feeling emanating from the rambling story . woody is slipping , his last few films have been heading on a steady downward path . 
1	the canadian film kissed by first-time director lynne stopkewich tackles one of the few subjects i have never seen considered before in the movies : necrophilia . before you either stop reading my review or start flaming me for liking this film , let me assure you that you have to see the movie to fully understand it . it handles its subject matter with delicacy . although it is frequently shocking , it is never exploitive . on the other hand , if you were to see this film without knowing what it is about , there is a good chance you might walk out or be sickened by some of the scenes . this is a movie that pulls no punches . if it were a hollywood film , the studio would have demanded a major rewrite after the first test screening . when i saw kissed at an advanced screening , the audience was fully engaged and many were enraged by the story . albeit only for the adventuresome filmgoer , this is a movie designed to make you think . the intelligent script by angus fraser and director lynne stopkewich is based on barbara gowdy's short story , " we so seldom look on love . " in a film that appears on the surface to be unique , there are numerous parallels to other pictures . first , the show is about obsession as is fatal attraction . finally , the film is actually the harold and maude for the 90s -- compulsively preoccupied with death . " i've always been fascinated by death , " explains the protagonist , sandra larson . " the feel of it , the smell of it , the quietness of it . " not much it turns out , but she is an eager pupil . he gives her the job and a single piece of advice , " don't wear black -- it's too depressing . " sandra approaches her work with a loving , sincere manner . in a science lesson unlike any i've ever seen before , we learn the details of embalming . i'll not repeat them lest you get ill . this scene , and not the sex , is the most difficult one to watch . the gross parts happen just off screen , but they tell you precisely what they are doing to the body . molly parker gives us a sandra who is gentle and kind . all of this is so beautifully done that you have to keep reminding yourself that this is a very disturbed young woman , and the guy she is violating is , afterall , dead . parker's performance was haunting but a bit aloof . if she could have revealed more about her motivation it would have helped enormously . the best we have is some of the dialog . " i'm consumed . " as i've told my readers before , i rarely try to guess the ending of the film , but in this one i was intrigued by the possibilities . among my numerous alternative endings , one of them did come to pass , but i was just as surprised that some of the others did not . " you didn't faint , " says the funeral director after sandra's embalming lesson . " that's always a good sign . " well , if you don't faint , you may like this most bizarre of films . then again , maybe not . " i never met anyone like you before , " says matt to sandra . " you're totally different . you're compelling . " so is the picture . kissed runs just 1 : 20 , but seems longer due to the subject matter's intensity . the film is not yet rated , but is certainly a candidate for an nc-17 rating for its sex , full frontal nudity , and , most of all , taboo theme . this is not a film for teenagers . i give it thumbs up as did my wife . would i recommend it ? well , if you can read this review and still be interested , you'd probably like the film . i give it * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	kopple had a real challenge in constructing an interesting film since woody turns out to be as dull as his movies are exciting . it reminded me of a two-person junior high school skit i was in , in which i was supposed to be playing " a member of the elite society , " whatever that meant . the most striking conclusion from viewing the movie is how incredibly unhappy woody is even with millions of fans and dollars . even when playing the new orleans style jazz that he reportedly loves , he looks miserable . grimacing with his eyes closed , he produces music that can be described as , well , pleasant , but he makes it look less like a labor of love than something to be endured . woody , although he clearly mugs for the camera at times , seems fairly natural . one even has its own large , indoor swimming pool with elaborate tiled mosaic floors that looks like it was last seen in an episode of " i , claudius . " with enormous doses of woody's music , the film spends little time analyzing what attracts woody to it . " there's nothing there between you and the pure feeling of playing , " woody says , giving us some hint of his motivation . " there's no cerebral part to it . " in one of the film's little insights , woody talks about why europeans like his movies better than americans . europeans even love his films , such as interiors , that bombed in the us . " the europeans like pictures that drone on , and i'm good at making pictures that drone on , " he explains . what may surprise woody's fans is that he is rarely funny in person and sometimes surprisingly inarticulate . ( " i'm appropriately animate for a human being in the context in which i exist , " is his retort to soon-yi's criticism of his lack of gestures on stage . ) actually , the film serves as proof that he doesn't enjoy anything . " you are so happy to be so intelligent , " one party guest , whose native tongue isn't english , tells woody . it is rated pg for a single use of the f-word and would be fine for kids around twelve and up . 
2	i was born , but . . . the shochiku kamata studio specialized in nonsense comedies , something the great director , one of the world's most acclaimed , yasujiro ozu ( the tokyo story/late spring/floating weeds ) was keen on doing during this period of his film career , when he refused to make talkies until yielding in 1935 , but continued to make silent social comedies , somewhat in the style and equal to in quality to the charlie chaplin and buster keaton films , though ozu's films were seen through the eyes of children rather than taken from the adult's point of view . they were ably co-scripted by the master of the nonsense film , akira fushimi . in i was born , but . . . , a film with lots of sight-gags , made as a social comedy turning darker as the story got a bit more involved with the patriarch of the family , mr . yoshii ( tatsuo saito ) . this splendid example of a salaryman's film , is the first great film of the master's , with many others to follow . there is a comic sandal fight among the boys , which brings out the film's visual humor from the way the framing of the shots magnifies the synchronized reactions of the two fighters . in fact , ozu's camera angles for adults when talking to children , are always taken from a higher elevation so that the adults are talking down to the children , always in a position of superiority . ozu draws the analogy of the workplace power structure to the way children naturally socialize , and states that the adults power is vindictively social , derived from one's station in life and how much money one has . the home movies become unbearably embarrassing to watch for yoshii and the children , as yoshii acts the part of the clown in them and is seen as an obviously inferior man than his boss . yoshii , himself , is embarrassed that he has to lower himself so much , but he is secretly pleased that he is so successful as a clown and can make everybody laugh . taro's only comment is , your father is really funny . ozu' other purpose of showing the home film , being always the gagman , it also gives him a chance to parody his own way of shooting films by having the home movie filmed in the same style he uses for this movie , such as by using the same tracking shots and camera height angles . the wry salaryman responds , " if i didn't , i wouldn't get paid and you wouldn't eat . " the boys illusion is that all power can be won through one's talents . but in the business world , the boss doesn't have to possess those character traits , he is the boss because that is the way society is structured , and it pays to submit to that hierarchy or else you will be left out in the cold to fend for yourself . the " but " in the film's title comes into place , as it indicates that everyone is born equal , " but " that changes soon enough . there is always something to disturb the stability assumed from the outset . it is now clear that yoshii grovels because he can't do anything else about it . and like many parents in america , he only wishes his children have a better life than he does , which draws him closer to the audience and presents him in a more sympathetic light . the plot of the film is encompassed within a short five-day period , and it parallels in a didactic way the social structure of the children and the grownups , and how in each group adjustments have to be made in order to survive , with the majority of the film being concerned about how the boys start growing up . the adult world is mainly used as a expansion of the boys' limited horizons . 
0	the artwork in the living museum argues convincing that mental instability and impressive art can go hand in hand . he compares the artistic results favorably with pieces on display in prestigious galleries like the whitney . even if the art is striking , the documentary by previous oscar winner jessica yu ( breathing lessons : the life and work of mark o'brien ) isn't . she divides the movie into chapters with one for each patient/artist , but the interviewees all speak in dull monotones . the intent is always clear . the living museum is the sort of good intentioned film that critics don't like to criticize . it's easier to offer a few meaningless platitudes and be done with it . as much as i enjoyed the three jessica yu short films i've seen before this one , the living museum is never compelling . the art it displays is interesting , but the interviews aren't . the people are all slightly quirky , as you would expect , but they drone so much that i never felt involved . perhaps as a tightly edited short , it would have worked , but as a feature length movie , it is dreadfully dull . it is not rated but would be pg for brief nudity and some sexuality and would be fine for kids old enough to be interested . 
0	this innocent comedy from spain just didn't have enough impact to hit a home run with its humor . it probably has more relevancy for its native audience ( at least , i hope it does ) , as most of its tv sitcom sketches just didn't register with my domestic comedy/romance antenna . the film's main asset is its popular star , carmen maura , considered by many spanish film critics to be spain's most accomplished actress . if you like that sort of comedy , then you might like this film . the story is probably autobiographical : the heroine ( carmen maura ) is a journalist named carmen , and the film is layed out in four sections , just like a newspaper , but here the divisions relate to the time of season . all the fights are mild and over the most trivial of things , which is supposed to make this very materially comfortable couple look ridiculous , since it is obvious that they have so much going for them that there is no reason for them to be fighting all the time . she then tells him , " the watch only looks expensive , it was really quite cheap . " somehow the film flew by , aided by its breezy pace , non-stop banter , and the lightheartedness of its direction . it was a sweet , palpable , likable little domestic comedy , similar to what american audiences saw on tv in the 1950s and 1960s ( except for the nudity and frank sexual talk ) . carmen maura put on a good show , outwitting the episodic script and coming to terms with her great mid-life crisis in a pleasing manner . it's a mild film , with mild comedy , and mild points to make about domestic relations . it is deserving of mild praise for its execution . 
1	in the story's best line , the funeral home brags in its advertisements that it's " your pit stop to the afterlife . " the script by david dean bottrell and jessie jones , based on their play " dearly departed , " might well have worked when it was a play , but , as a movie , it feels so much like a typical television sitcom that it's a wonder that it doesn't have a laugh track . of course , since this is a slapstick comedy , the movie doesn't expect us to take any of this seriously . although harmless enough , the movie is rarely funny . my personal laugh count was zip . still , if you're a fan of tv sitcoms , which i'm not , you might like kingdom come . some very vocal members of my audience certainly did . it is rated pg for thematic elements , language and sensuality and would be acceptable for kids around 8 and up . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
0	screenplay : lewis colick . producers : nicholas palelogos , andrew scheinman , frederick zollo , rob reiner . director : rob reiner . mpaa rating : r ( violence , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 130 minutes . it took watching a time to kill for the second time in less than a year for me to realize that i had been too easy on it the first time around . actually , it wasn't a time to kill i saw the second time -- it was ghosts of mississippi -- but that's merely a technicality . the premise is simplistic and obvious , but at least a time to kill featured some strong performances . ghosts of mississippi is a plodding , ridiculously earnest film in which any potential drama gets water-logged in a big puddle of white liberal guilt . though the evidence against beckwith is strong , the presence of more than a few similarly minded witnesses and jurors results in two hung juries in 1964 . this is a film which wants you to leave with the message " racism is bad " tattooed across your backbrain , and i suppose you'd have to say that it succeeds . unfortunately , reiner and writer lewis colick spoon-feed that message to the audience like it was cough syrup ; they are so concerned with making ghosts of mississippi good for you that they don't take the time to make it good . many of the same problems were evident in a time to kill , along with more than a few of the same specific plot details . the hero's wife admonishes him for his irresponsibility , anonymous racists vandalize his property , and a threat to his family merely serves to stiffen his resolve -- all familiar elements in serious-minded social dramas . at lest a time to kill had the benefit of some strong performances to give the stock scenarios some spark , though . as rabble-rousing as a time to kill managed to be at times , at least there appeared to be a few characters in it who were passionate about the incendiary issues involved . you might expect some energy from james woods as the unrepentant bigot , and to a certain extent you get it . there is such an obvious build-up toward a big courtroom confrontation between beckwith and bobby that you can almost hear rob reiner in the background coaching woods on his " you can't handle the truth " speech , yet that moment never comes . and i found myself missing it , as melodramatic and historically inaccurate as it might have been , because at least it would have given ghosts of mississippi a fire to match its sincerity . i'm sure everyone involved felt they had made an important film , and in one sense they have : it is important to remember that even sentiments this honorable needs to have an interesting story to tell . this mississippi isn't burning . . . it's boring . 
1	she has succeeded , albeit perhaps * too * well . all the elements of this story are achingly familiar , having formed the plot core of everything from tv soap operas to harlequin romances . the only difference here is that all three participants are women -- but just because something is " gay " doesn't make it inherently better or more interesting than its " straight " counterpart . a tired story is worn out regardless of the sexual orientation of the characters . the first half-hour of devotion , while lively and energetic , has a glib tone that displays little sympathy for its characters . everyone is constantly smiling , but the happiness seems forced and unnatural . there's a jaded feel which threatens to alienate the audience . eventually , devotion softens its approach , devolving into a fairly routine melodramatic style with all the expected love triangle elements : passion , love , jealousy , and self-doubt . as the film moves along , it becomes possible to feel for the characters , even though the screenplay holds few epiphanies . devotion is graced by the strong performances of jan derbyshire and kate twa . it's a credit to the actresses that they're able to do something with such limited material . both throw themselves into the work with an earnestness that gets translated to the audience . on those rare occasions when devotion sparkles , it has little to do with the script and everything to do with its stars . regurgitated story and tone variations aside , one of the primary reasons why devotion represents such a dubious entertainment value is that it's far too long . there's not enough real psychological or emotional drama to sustain this story for two hours , and the average viewer will find herself or himself fidgeting through the last quarter . bits of devotion will strike a responsive chord with some audience members , but the movie as a whole doesn't reach the level of achievement it's striving for . ultimately , the strengths of the presentation don't adequately compensate for the banality of the content . 
1	cast : gaby hoffman , christina ricci , thora birch , ashleigh aston moore , demi moore , rosie o'donnell , melanie griffith , rita wilson director : lesli linka glatter producers : suzanne todd and demi moore screenplay : i . marlene king cinematography : ueli steiger music : cliff edelman u . s . distributor : new line cinema what is it about females bonding in graveyards ? unless i'm very much mistaken , this is not representative of a real-life trend . the tactic of including these sequences is symptomatic of the single major flaw suffered by both films--a contrived artificiality that deadens any possible emotional response to the characters or their situations . very little in this film comes across as believable . when individual moments work ( and it's usually just isolated " moments " , not even whole scenes ) , it's typically because they involve the kind minutiae anyone can dredge up from their memories . for example , consider the rather charming account of a first kiss . in penning this , screenwriter i . marlene king probably relied more on real experience than imagination . unfortunately , this sort of personal insight is not the norm for now and then's hopelessly mundane script . the film opens and closes in the modern time frame . between the modern-day prologue and epilogue , we are treated to an eighty-minute flashback to the summer of 1970 . everything , from the overall arc of the story to individual lines of dialogue , is too obvious . the four young actresses are all more impressive than their adult counterparts , although certain casting choices left me scratching my head . this goes beyond a reasonable suspension of disbelief . at least the other three transformations are acceptable . while the 1970s segments of now and then are of the hit-and-miss variety , the 1995 scenes are uniformly bad . i had some interest in what happened with the twelve year olds , but i didn't care about them at all once they had grown up . the " now " scenes feel much like an excuse for four high-profile actresses to lend their names to this film . at best , their presence is superfluous . yet even had the film remained entirely in the " then " time frame , it still would have been lacking . there's just not enough originality here , no matter what year it is . 
1	some authors are easily transferable to the medium of film . but for some novelists , the adaptations have all resulted in varying degrees of failure . although it has some appeal and charm , it also ends up on the debit side of his ledger . first time screenwriter robert weide tries hard to make a film out of vonnegut's book , but i suspect the book's style make such efforts almost hopeless . vonnegut's books have a cult following , especially on campuses , but their appeal lies in their strange syntax and structure as much as in their characters . this part of the film is shot by tom richmond in a grainy black and white . most of the show is told in flashback where the images are full of lush colors that are , for reasons i'll discuss later , too pretty . howard says , " you love good , you hate evil , and you'd do anything for the sake of romance . " " i guess the moral here is : you must be careful what you pretend to be because in the end you are who you're pretending to be , " reasons howard about his moral dilemma . nolte is an actor with a proclivity for overacting . mulholland falls is one such film , but hopefully you missed it . here he gives the first performance where he manages to underact . his acting is disengaged and borders on being boring . even when nolte's acting is awful , it has rarely been boring . gordon's direction is never involving , and the viewers become little more than voyeurs . " yes , i've changed . this act is even less effective than the first . one makes sense , and the other doesn't . first , the script includes some excellent dialog , bitingly funny and insightful . second , the show has a lovely serenity to it . since this is a tragedy about nazis and about innocent people being trapped , why we should have this tranquillity makes little sense . outwardly the situations are tragic , but the lush cinematography , the overly dreamy music by michael convertino and the peaceful composure of most of the participants give the film an inappropriate peacefulness . the scenes of wartime germany are picture postcard perfect . finally , the audience is lulled with the constant sounds of bing crosby's melodious voice singing " white christmas . " i hope that movie producers will not again waste our time with vonnegut . savor him in print if you will , but don't try to force his work where it doesn't fit . it is rated r . there is brief nudity , a little violence , and some bad language . the show is all pretty mild and would be fine for any teenager . i enjoyed parts of it , especially the script , but there is not enough there to recommend it . i give the picture * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	as you might surmise from a mainstream film like this , it wants to pull you along with all the heartaches it can muster from these lonely souls , and it does so , by making use of semi flashbacks and scenes that have a mixture of fantasy and reality to it . to a lesser degree , this style of filmmaking also works for the less complicated pat , as his mental grief comes pouring out in spurts . the film's title , living out loud , is deliberately misleading , as it should really be retitled as " fantasizing out loud . " this therefore becomes a film more intrigued with self-awareness than with relationships and loses its edge as a romantic film . its brightest hope is how the viewer relates to the film's stars . i didn't , so the film just seemed to drag for me at times and it seemed manipulative , to the bargain . my problem is that i didn't really care what happened to them . why they were sad and lonely , is a sympathetic enough story , but there was just nothing served up that made me feel that this predictable story had anywhere important to go . the only innovative feature of the film , which did save it from the doldrums , was that we were able to go inside their heads and hear their thinking process at work . the filmmaker has borrowed this guise of introspection from the pages of chekhov , which works out reasonably well on film , though it is still better served as a device for the reader of books . at least the film never turns to mush , as its static atmosphere is enhanced mostly by some of the lively nightclub scenes , such as when liz is belting out her sultry jazz numbers and offering good cheer for advice ( trust me , it wasn't on a par to the biblical solomon's advice ) . but i couldn't picture them falling in love for even a second and certainly not for a minute , these two were just not compatable . but come to think of it , she's pretty dull herself . the fantasy she has of making it with the hunk masseur ( cibrian ) , who gives her the sex massage she dreams of , are the kind of private thoughts that perhaps more people have than what is commonly thought , but this is certainly not a way to self-discovery and a way out of her situation , though it seems to help her in someway , but the film has really not made it clear how she was helped . this bittersweet romance turns out to be too dry for my taste ; but , it is , nevertheless , faultlessly told and seems to be sincere in its presentation , and what the heck , they seem to be ok people , and probably merit a tad of sympathy for their plight . his attempt here to make a combination fantasy and a straight romance film , has worked with mixed results . i think the major fault for the film's dullness lies with the co-stars ; i couldn't get aroused by holly hunter's performance , as intelligent as it was , it was still too plain and too staid . while danny de vito , who is a natural comic and is best at being featured as a second-banana , wasn't funny enough here and couldn't be taken seriously enough as a romantic suitor for holly . i'm not saying that he was completely miscast , he did bring some depth to his character's anguished situation and believability to his role . but someone else , a more romantic leading man , might have given the film a romantic tension to it that it desperately needed . though i realize the point of the story was that these two weren't really suited for each other in the first place and that this was the odd twist to their non-romance . but my point is , that they could have been not suited for each other all right , but not by such a wide margin as these two were . but that was also too predictable an ending , limiting the scope of the film . 
0	promotional posters for she's so lovely describe it as " a film by nick cassavetes from a fable by john cassavetes , " a tag-line which prompted a visit to my american heritage dictionary : 1 ) a concise narrative making an edifying or cautionary point , often employing as characters animals which speak and act like human beings . " i suppose you could say that she's so lovely fits that definition , in the sense that it makes a cautionary point . as for animals acting like people , you won't find any in she's so lovely . people acting like animals . . . well , that's another story . there is at least a convincingly seamy aura to the portion of she's so lovely devoted to eddie and maureen's kinetic romance . vintage cassavetes ambiance drips from the depressingly silent flop houses and dive bars , and from the characters wandering around in a directionless , drunken daze . yet even in its best moments , she's so lovely feels not quite right . it's like the steak transported through the telepods in david cronenberg's version of the fly , a story from another era which has been rendered synthetic in its transport to 1997 . despite the strong performances and affectingly crazy exploits of penn and penn , there's the feel of an homage to the first half of she's so lovely . it has no unique identity . to show you how far looking for a unique identity gets you , witness the second half of she's so lovely . but young cassavetes treats the whole episode as the wacky premise for a profane situation comedy , as though papa had banged out a very special episode of " my two dads " twenty years ago . the whimsical score by joseph vitarelli consistently undermines the seriousness of the matters at hand ; situations like eddie's appointment with an effeminate hairdresser are treated as atmospheric goofiness . instead of wondering whom maureen will end up with , your mind wanders to why nick didn't go all the way and use a laugh track . for that matter , it's not clear what john was thinking when he wrote it , with its half-realized characters , awkwardly constructed narrative and weightless romantic triangle . there's a lesson to be learned here , something like " it's best to let sleeping scripts lie . " here endeth the fable . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
1	takeshi " beat " kitano is certainly a unique director , whose absurdist style of filmmaking is readily recognizable , achieving auteur status . he has a fascination with gangsters , violence , and in presenting his quirky black humor in a most compelling way . his films are always visually startling , with a bevy of bizarre shots , and , so far , all his films have gotten away with a mindless but intriguing storyline . he is so fascinating to watch , that it is shame we couldn't see more of his lunacy ; instead , the supporting cast , funny as they are with their deadpan humor , nevertheless , they cannot carry the film , and kitano has chosen to center the film around them . fortunately , there are plenty of his usual visual treats in this film , that make the film seem special anyhow . kitano , also , relishes giving women roles that could be considered demeaning . though it is sickeningly amusing to see how rough-shod he treats them in so callous and an ungentlemanly manner , that one might be caught ruefully laughing at them getting dumped on and treated as garbage , and supposedly liking it and coming back for more , it still shows that he doesn't really know how to portray women on screen . maybe he knows something i don't know . but there is never any romance in his films that amount to anything , and this film is no exception . this mindless act escalates on both sides , and , of course , it makes no sense . this is all casually done , as if this kind of mayhem was as natural as eating rice cakes . if there is any point to this story , and i am not sure there is , but the message here might be , that friends are needed to help you out , no one is immune from the insanity that is in the air , because according to kitano , insanity is catching . and , if taking a stand alone against many , you are in deep trouble . somehow this visual feast of a film was strangely appealing and original in all aspects of filmmaking . so let me say bravo to the one time stand-up comedian who doesn't know how to make a safe film , and tip my eagle baseball hat to him , not only for hitting a home run , but showing that one can hit a home run but not score the needed winning run by running past the man who was on base . a cult film delight as a cruel form of entertainment , that is not for all tastes , naturally . incidently , the american title to the film , boiling point , is misleading : in japanese the title refers in slang to a baseball score . 
2	" stop it with those stupid pictures of yours ! " a heartfelt , crowd-pleaser of a story , the debut suffers from acting that can be amateurish at times and a plot that could be called clich ? d were the film not so honest in its presentation . but it is a movie that is able to rise above its limitations . it is also one that is careful to show that racist attitudes occur in all cultures . that it is all predictable doesn't negate its impact . i found myself applauding at one point as one guy finally got what was coming to him . filmed handsomely by hisham abed , the debut isn't one of those indie pictures shot on grainy video that attempts to equate gritty ugliness with realism . the movie knows when to back off and include some self-deprecating humor . the best of the film's humor comes from the party's filipino-american militant . it turns out that white folks have invented hot cars as a way to distract filipino-americans from their lack of opportunities . " that's deep !

2	screenplay : leslie bohem . director : roger donaldson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , intense situations ) running time : 105 minutes . i have been anticipating the arrival of dante's peak , the first of 1997's two volcano films , with a combination of dread and . . . well , still more dread . the return of the disaster film has been about as welcome a pop culture phenomenon as 70s nostalgia , both of them reincarnating uncalculated vapidity as calculated vapidity . it only takes one twister to turn you off the genre ; throw in independence day and daylight and any critic could be excused for walking into dante's peak with an attitude . but if i have to sit through more disaster films , i only hope they can be as thrilling as dante's peak . though just as plot- and character-impaired as its genre cousins , dante's peak delivers a solid hour of relentless tension and excitement . dante's peak is a strange kind of success , because it includes many of the noteworthy flaws of twister , and then some . we get the same obligatory romantic pair thrown into danger with a minimalist back-story tagged on , along with a team of quirky scientists to provide comic relief . brosnan is ruddy and somber for most of the film's running time , hamilton is frazzled and likeable , and both of them trudge dutifully through fifty minutes of exposition as though any unnecessary acting might tire them out before the big finish . leslie bohem ( the scripter of record on daylight , apparently a specialist in films which end with traumatized people wrapped in heavy blankets ) also adds a dose of jaws , but doesn't give us the pleasure of an actual villain . charles hallahan provides the political voice who ends up causing more damage , and there is a teasing sub-plot about a potentially skittish business developer . neither one offers enough conflict , however , forcing the audience to sit and wait out the plodding first half for the big show . and what a show it turns out to be . the surprising thing about the post-eruption second half of dante's peak isn't necessarily that it is effective , but that the reason for its effectiveness doesn't exist entirely on a hard drive somewhere . there are certainly a few impressive visual effects sequences , including a cloud packing the concussive force of a small nuclear weapon , but director roger donaldson gets just as much mileage out of the time-honored technique of jiggling the camera to represent an earthquake . no , dante's peak is an effective thriller because the characters repeatedly find themselves in new and apparently impossible situations , and the direction gives those sequences an edge-of-the-seat tension . from a dizzying truck ride through town destined for the universal studios tour , to the crossing of a flood-threatened bridge , to a mine shaft which threatens to turn brosnan into a sardine , dante's peak provides the kind of relentless , well-crafted action which is what movie-goers should be talking about when they talk about certain films being like roller-coasters . the biggest surprise of all may be that the man behind that action is donaldson , who has served up cinematic backwash like species , the getaway and cocktail . it is an eerie moment , and donaldson manages to get you itching for the fate of the characters even though they haven't been given any personalities . more impressive still , he does it without assaulting your senses . there is , however , something rare in a film which can generate the kind of tension dante's peak generates . maybe it is possible to present a disaster without being one . 
1	this , his first film since his 1994's death and the maiden , is a visually stunning mystery chiller about the supernatural that is a good example of old-fashioned storytelling . a lengthy film ( 132 minutes ) that doesn't overstay its welcome , as it keeps one guessing till the very end how it will be resolved and even then , there is puzzlement . but the film is not without some flaws in its storytelling as attested by the last scenes , which are resolved in pyrotechnics and do leave a lot to be desired . many critics will justifiably argue that there is no proper payoff in the director's payoff . but i'll take this polanski version of a horror story over so many others that i have seen recently , there is an elegant craftsmanship and an ability shown by him , to keep one in suspense for most of the film without resorting to hollywood's special effect grab bag of tricks typically used for this genre . polansky also captured the feel of what it is like to be a rare-book collector . it is a film that , if it does nothing else , it depicts the lives of those who are searching for dramatic meaning in their life through books of the occult . that polanski is a skeptic , only adds resonance to the telling of the story . he does not make a copy of the book and therefore places himself in an awkward spot if the book should be stolen . his unique lifestyle is one that is rarely depicted in movies as well as it is here . she is the most enigmatic character in the story , whose real identity will be revealed by the end of the film . she did have one nude scene in the movie , which she passed with flying colors . there are more things to like about this film than dislike . for starters , i was impressed by depp's subdued performance , it gave his character credibility and even though he wasn't an ethical character , he made himself more palatable as the film progressed and he seemed to become more of a victim than someone who is uncaringly in this deal for just a windfall profit . he had a healthy detachment from the subject matter of the book ( just like the director was detached from the storyline ) , as he unwittingly uncovers various reasons people like to collect occult books . i was also impressed by the way darius khondji's cinematography took me around europe , into castles , private library collections , voyeuristically looking into dark corners , and into a devil worship ceremony . it was shot largely by using a wide-angled lens , always pointing to interesting shots of dark corridors , or of villages that had a strangely beautiful feel toward them . i felt i was transported into the world of book collectors , hearing them converse and seeing what makes them want to be collectors , and how some are merely pretenders and some real lovers of books . the film , unfortunately , ultimately suffered from an undue silliness and how it ended by fading out to a glowing white screen , as if that is supposed to mean something special , did not work for me . unless , it is meant solely as polansky's private joke that all this devil worship is nonsense in the first place , and by ending on a blank note , all he is doing is telling the audience that there is nothing to see . if there's a more metaphysical message , it wasn't conveyed to me by the film . but , that aside , i still maintain that this picaresque film adapted from arturo perez-reverte's popular spanish novel el club dumas is better than most satanic thrillers , especially those recent ones relying on blood and gore to shock the viewer . here , the director is mostly spoofing the conventions of horror movies and it is his very personal humor that should be appreciated , along with the brilliance he brings to the screen with his filmmaking ability . the satan worshippers' annual meeting on torchia's birthday is a good example of what i mean by the director's brand of malevolent humor being on display , seeing how the wannabes in satanism are cloaked in black and using mumbo jumbo to summon up satan , as langella boldly enters their ceremony and calls them all fools and shouts , " boo ! " that is the joke polansky is having with the audience . both these ritualized ceremonies should not be looked at without seeing them for the farces they are in the eyes of each filmmaker . polansky has crafted a metaphysical suspense film that is more lightheaded than scary , which might disappoint some but should not take away from the many pleasures derived from this engrossing thriller . 
1	there is a telling moment in the tango lesson . in a movie that mixes reality and fiction with a movie within a movie and with characters playing quasi-autobiographical parts , sally potter plays the lead named , you guessed it , sally . late 40-ish sally , with her pencil thin lips , her curly hair , and her attractive , svelte figure , makes an interesting contrast to pablo and the male professional dancers in the film . sally clearly enjoys every minute of it . here the ambiguity is intentional for it is never clear where the fictional sally ends and the real sally begins . so what exactly is a tango ? forget the concept of the tango as a part of the ballroom dance cannon for it shares little with the fox trot or the waltz . the result is an energetic and highly visual endeavor . would that the movie , the tango lesson , possessed more of that fire . when the dancers are on center stage the film certainly hums , but the rest of the film relies on a story that is so thin that it quickly loses its audience . tango becomes the sexual subtext of the picture . to underscore this , pablo greets sally with a deep-voiced , " it's been a long time . " with a twinkling smile , she responds , " it certainly has . " another subtheme concerns religion -- sally and pablo are both of jewish ancestry . " how did you choose the tango ? " " i didn't ; the tango chose me , " he replies as if he had had a religious calling . the movie contains little spoken dialog . the dialog is more danced than spoken . the surreal subplot of her pitching a movie to hollywood and the remainder of the non-dancing parts are disappointing . the producer doesn't like it being in french and starring a legless fashion designer . that this film would almost certainly be a poor investment at twenty mil is ignored as sally , the writer , ridicules hollywood . the tango lesson , even in the many slow parts , is a hard film not to like . " it suits me to lead , and you can't deal with that . " it is partially in french and spanish with english subtitles , but it is mainly in the languages of english and dance . it is rated pg for adult themes . the picture would be fine for kids around ten and up . 
1	while the british release , which probably has aspirations of connecting with the four weddings and a funeral crowd , offers an occasional worthwhile joke , it's ultimately so lacking in substance that it becomes difficult to care about anyone or anything . the probable argument in favor of shooting fish is that the movie generates a warm , fuzzy feeling . my response to this is to note that the only ones likely to experience such a sense of muted bliss are those who turn off their brains . the film is preposterous to the point of distraction , where the necessary level of suspension of disbelief exceeds the capacity of a normal , thinking person . the approach would be forgivable if the movie was genuinely funny or otherwise endearing , but moments of laughter and charm are infrequent and widely-spaced . con men often make for delightful motion picture protagonists , because their presence allows screenwriters to devise all sorts of intricate moves in various games of deception . alas , that's not the case here . even the opening gambit , with the pair selling a " voice-activated computer , " isn't remotely credible . and it's hard to feel any sympathy for the victims , who are either ( a ) nasty men getting what's coming to them , ( b ) gullible fools who deserve to be ripped off , or ( c ) both . in reality , that's just an excuse for their lifestyle of adrenaline-generating close shaves . supposedly , there's a heart lurking beneath his slick exterior , but it's not often in evidence . in the glorious tradition of motion picture nerds , he gets hopelessly tongue-tied around women . watching shooting fish is a lot like drinking carbonated water . there's a little bit of fizz , and the sensation isn't unpleasant , but the whole experience fails to offer much satisfaction . shooting fish is a harmless dud , and any minor pleasure it generates vanishes so quickly that it's hard to believe it was actually there in the first place . the movie frequently treads a line between being marginally engaging and painfully trite . unfortunately , when all is said and done , a majority of the scenes fall in the latter camp rather than in the former .

1	cast : eric stoltz , annabella sciorra , christopher eigeman , carlos jacott , marianne jean-baptiste , brian kerwin , peter bogdanovich , bridget fonda director : noah baumbach producer : joel castleberg screenplay : noah baumbach cinematography : steven bernstein music : robert een u . s . distributor : lion's gate releasing jealousy is not a subtle film -- it's a dark comedy about what happens when a man's deep-rooted insecurity undermines his romantic relationship . at times , the plot ventures into sit-com land , and director noah baumbach borrows liberally from other directors ( woody allen and whit stillman in particular ) . nevertheless , despite numerous flaws , i appreciated elements of mr . jealousy , in large part because baumbach captures something about the inherent insecurity in sexual relationships that most films either ignore or oversimplify . like kevin smith's chasing amy , this movie addresses questions about trust and fidelity , and gets some of the details right . ever since then , lester has had serious issues about trusting women . but things get a little more complicated than lester ever could have imagined . mr . jealousy isn't the kind of movie that forges an intimate emotional connection between the protagonist and the audience . the frequent , glib narrative voiceover ensures a certain distance between lester and us . after all , it's difficult to get involved in a character's life when the film maker is constantly intruding on the story with occasionally-amusing but often-superfluous commentary ( sort of like watching mystery science theater 3000 ) . on an intellectual level , however , mr . jealousy works when we try to puzzle out how we would react in lester's position and whether his fears are well-founded . baumbach understands the roots of relationship angst , and how damaging it can be , and , like woody allen , he opts for something more insightful than a superficial treatment . mr . jealousy's central contrivance hurts the film's believability . it's even less likely that vince would later be admitted into the same group when using a fake british accent and pretending to be lester . the entire dynamic seems unnecessarily fabricated , and the slim humor that baumbach milks from the situation isn't worth the strain on the story's credibility . good acting is crucial to the success of an intimate piece like this , and mr . jealousy is blessed with a solid cast . eric stoltz ( who previously worked with baumbach in kicking and screaming ) makes lester's paranoia seem almost rational ( that's because it's presented as only a slight exaggeration of insecurities that everyone is familiar with ) . annabella sciorra is effective as ramona , although the character could have used a little more fleshing out . in the end , i felt much the same about mr . jealousy as i did about baumbach's previous feature , kicking and screaming . the movie paints a good portrait of some of the most common generation x concerns , but fails to personalize them . the writer/director may have a deep understanding of his material , but mr . jealousy doesn't offer anything original or remarkable , and , while what the film is saying often strikes a responsive chord , that alone isn't enough to earn it an enthusiastic recommendation .

0	screenplay : barry fanaro . producers : barry sonnenfeld and barry josephson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity , sexual situations , brief nudity ) running time : 88 minutes . some concepts are funny on paper , even if there's no way they could ever be classic comedies in reality . the crew has such a concept . sure it is . there have been other comedies about seniors turning to a life of crime rather than going gentle into that good night , like the 1979 george burns/art carney/lee strassburg vehicle going in style , but a wiseguy twist sounds promising . it may not be chock-a-block with rapier-sharp witticisms , and there may be a prostate gag or two to wade through , but there should be a few laughs , right ? there's only so much you can do to screw up a solid concept . right ? in fact , the crew screws up its solid concept so badly , and in so many provocative variations , that it's practically a road map for misbegotten film-making . ah , the wacky complications that are possible with the inclusion of a pissed-off drug lord . can you feel your sides splitting at the crazy goofy hilarity ? and can you feel a tear trickling down your cheek because bobby is really a sensitive guy , searching high and low for the daughter he hasn't seen in 30 years ? the reason the crew stinks -- or at least the main reason -- is that it's not about what it's about . a movie about geriatric mobsters could be funny . you could have them interact with their modern counterparts to show them how it's done old school , like a scorsese version of space cowboys , or focus on what kind of rackets they could run in their senior-heavy milieu . there's good character stuff there , too -- what happens when you're left to fossilize after once being part of a culture of macho action ? but the crew isn't about any of that . it isn't about anything , really , because there's so much garbage thrown into 88 minutes of script that it never develops anything remotely resembling comic momentum . director michael dinner , meanwhile , over-directs madly in compensation , operating under the delusion that you can somehow make a terrible script funny by filming everyone in fish-eye close-up . even the editing chops gags into such minute shreds that set-ups are separated from their punch lines . something this fundamentally incompetent should carry a government warning sticker . there are exactly two moments in the crew when the experience of watching it is remotely tolerable . for the other 84 minutes , the crew isn't simply unfunny ; it's a test of an audience's good will , practically an exercise in making every wrong narrative , performance or technical choice possible . it's a good pitch turned into a terrible script turned into a godawful film . actual humor from a solid concept ? see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	screenplay : michael piller . director : jonathan frakes . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , violence ) running time : 101 minutes . by now , every " star trek " fan deserving of the name is familiar with the " odd-even " rule for the feature films . the second , fourth , sixth and eighth films in the series have been the most entertaining ; the first , third , fifth and seventh , not so much . star trek : insurrection , the latest biannual return of the " next generation " cast , marks the ninth big-screen journey into the trek universe , inspiring a combination of trepidation and hope . could this finally be the adventure which would break the odd-number jinx ? well , not exactly . star trek : insurrection is an average story , competently told , energized primarily by the chance to mingle once again with the characters from the " next generation " television series . it seems that radiation on the ba'ku planet possesses a " fountain of youth " quality which makes it incredibly valuable , particularly to the genetically deteriorating son'a . star trek : insurrection , like most of the films in the series , is clearly designed to appeal to the trek faithful first , and to a broader audience second . that's one of the qualities which makes insurrection feel as fragmented as it does . over the course of a 100 minute film , trying to give seven characters enough to do to keep them happy leads to plenty of punch lines but not enough focus . stewart has the presence to make virtually anything he does feel commanding , but there's always a sense that he should have _more_ to do . just as he was always the best thing about the " next generation " series , he's the bext thing about the " next generation " films , whether playing the fool in a ceremonial headdress or radiating moral courage . stewart as picard is almost always going to be a good enough reason to watch a trek film , while watching him step back for the good of the ensemble will always be a bit disappointing . there are other good reasons to see this particular film , including some sharply-staged action sequences ( frakes showed a similar facility in 1996's first contact ) and plenty of belly laughs . there are also other reasons to be disappointed , including a wasted villain in f . murray abraham and a resolution which you may miss if you blink . altogether it feels a bit small for the big screen , more like a solid episode of the series ( complete with obvious allegory ) than a film . perhaps there aren't that many great ideas for trek features to go around , and maybe that's why the heirs to gene roddenberry's vision manage to come up with a really good one only once every four years . if they decided not to make a movie every two years , and waited until that really good idea was ready , they could eliminate that " odd-even " problem once and for all . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
0	what could be funnier that the mere sight of a really obese woman ? well , if this is your brand of humor -- as it was for exactly one very vocal member of our audience -- then big momma's house , starring martin lawrence ( blue streak ) , may be just the film for you . this one-joke movie generated a paltry number of laughs from our audience , save the aforementioned one-person laugh track . my personal laugh count total was exactly zero . the movie's attempts at humor weren't even enough to get many small grins out of me . only in the few episodes when lawrence escapes his " funny " costume does the story ever possess any genuine charm . sherry , played by the lovely nia long ( boiler room ) , adds class to a movie that doesn't have much . an actress who brings intelligence and grace to her pictures , she has such well-scrubbed looks that she always seems as if she just finished shooting a commercial for beauty soap . director raja gosnell , working from a hopeless script by darryl quarles and don rhymer , gives lawrence little apparent guidance , letting him wander around aimlessly in his outlandish outfit , searching for laughs . typical of the film's humor is a basketball match in which big momma plays a mean game , surprising some teenagers with her agility . at it's worst , suffice it to say that you'll thank your lucky stars that smell-o-vision didn't catch-on . is there anything good in the movie other than nia long ? the music is not bad . it is rated pg-13 for crude humor , sexual innuendo , language , brief nudity and some violence and would be acceptable for kids around 10 and up . my son jeffrey , age 11 , who loved lawrence's last picture ( blue streak ) , laughed very little at this one . giving it just * * , he liked lawrence only during those rare moments when he wasn't wearing a ton of latex . his main criticism of the film was simply that it wasn't very funny . 
0	like the rest of gough lewis's sensationalized but shallow documentary , sex : the annabel chong story , her brave boast doesn't hold up under examination . the men either wore condoms or were hiv-tested porn stars , and annabel is just an exhibitionist who doesn't care much about anything other that getting attention . the documentary , however , tries with little success to paint a completely different portrait of annabel -- that of a modern-day feminist . like much of the story , the devil is in the details . unlike the thoughtful and insightful the girl next door about porn star stacy valentine , this documentary is built with one cheap shot after another . it even opens with the king of schlock , jerry springer . the movie is filled with such bad questions followed by even worse non-responses . " what sort of artistic statement were you making ? " perhaps my least favorite throw-away question is the one that the director asks grace's mother . guess , what ? there are many good questions that could have been asked . one was how grace , a woman with a horrible set of teeth , a modest body , no acting acumen and little to recommend her , ever made it in the porn business in the first place . another might be , what was it that attracted men enough to have them rent her tapes before the marathon sex session which brought her notoriety . this crude movie is more concerned with a quick buck , so such informative questions are avoided . the movie , which drones on and on , with one talking head after another , feels like it will never end . ( annabel's lack of credible acting ability really shows through in these scenes . ) one wonders if the director is trying to make the audience feel annabel's exhaustion during her sexual olympics , as he drags out his movie way past it's natural ending point . a little mirth in such a dull movie would have helped . it does , however , contain one extremely funny bit of self-deprecating humor . the male porn star of a movie called " the oral majority , " talks about annabel's sexual stunt . it is not rated but would be nc-17 for strong sex scenes and language . the film would not be acceptable for those under 19 . 
2	watch how menacing robert walker can make bruno with nothing more that a devious smile and a box of popcorn he munches nonchalantly . miriam , played like a oversexed schoolgirl by laura elliot , is pregnant but probably not with guy's baby . hitchcock is a master at setting up scenes for maximum effect . and when the camera moves to outside its entrance , we hear a scream from inside , which turns out to be nothing more than miriam yelling at one of her boyfriends with an " oh , stop that , " meaning don't do anything of the kind . in another beautifully composed sequence miriam's glasses fall off when bruno begins to strangle her . ten minutes into the film . but not to worry , guy has a rock solid alibi . hitchcock's characters , as usual , feature an everyman , guy in this movie , wrapped up in a web he has trouble breaking . hitchcock has a deft touch with his actors producing characters in predicaments that are easy to empathize with . as guy gets swept up in the story's whirlpool , hitchcock uses some classic and always effective thriller backdrops such an amusement park . more imaginative is setting up a tennis match that doesn't look like it will end soon enough as a way to ratchet up the tension . and , finally , a run-away merry-go-round provides the film's piece de resistance vehicle for terror . it is rated pg for violence and tension and would be fine for kids around nine and up .

1	" you want to practice parking ?

" this is terrible , " you may thinking to yourself . before you pop the tape out of the vcr and return it to the rental store , hang in there a bit and you may become as enchanted with clueless as was i . with a properly open mind , you can see why the critics gave the film such rave reviews when it opened . i skipped it at the time figuring the film was another dumb teenager flick . big mistake . as you watch the show and laugh at the priceless dialog by writer and director amy heckerling ( from the look who's talking series ) , the story line may sound familiar . if it does , you are not imagining things . after seeing this film , you may want to check out this year's emma if you missed it in the theaters . affluence does have its dangers . clearly , theirs is a much higher claim to fame . her beguiling smile and energy is so infectious that it is impossible not to like her . i suspect there are few actors who could have carried off this part without lapsing into cliches and slapstick . she manages to take absurd material and make it seem somehow plausible . if the classroom scenes appear to be lifted from fast times at ridgemont high , this should come as no surprise since that film was directed by amy heckerling too . derivative though they may be , they are fresh here . cher , you see , does not believe in high school boys since , " searching for a boy in high school is like searching for meaning in a pauly shore movie .

2	there are two kinds of viewers for the x-files movie : those have seen at least a few episodes of the tv series and those who have never watched it . i am a member of the latter group , so that's the perspective from which this review is written . as a result , i cannot assess how the film will appeal to a die-hard follower of the program . but , for the " uneducated " movie-goer , the x-files offers two hours of solid entertainment . ( of course , one unanswered question is how many non-x files aficionados will exhibit sufficient interest to venture into a theater showing this picture . ) transferring a television program to the big screen has become a routine procedure for a film industry starved for ideas , but this is a rare occasion when the movies continue the adventures begun on the small screen , with no re-casting involved . twentieth century fox is hoping the wrinkle : the television series is still going strong . in interviews , writer/producer/series creator chris carter has stated that his goal with the x-files was to make a movie that could stand on its own . there's no question that he has succeeded . the script can be followed by someone with literally no previous knowledge of the characters or situations . ( by " cleverly , " i mean that these passages don't cry out , " character exposition ! " ) although i'm told that the storyline picks up where the last season of the tv program left off , there's no sense that new viewers are entering in the middle of things . the only obvious concession to the ongoing series is the ending , which includes several hooks that can be used to launch stories in the upcoming season . mulder and scully have exchanged their investigations of things paranormal and extraterrestrial for more mundane matters such as terrorism . plot-wise , the x-files bears more than a passing resemblance to 1996's alien invasion/conspiracy movie , the arrival . although things get sloppy near the end , when several story holes are ignored or ineffectively plugged , the script as a whole exhibits an uncommon intelligence for this type of movie . in addition , director rob bowman ( who has helmed a number of the tv episodes ) maintains a fairly high level of tension as the complexities of the multi-layered plot mount . the movie is perhaps a little too long ; cutting ten or fifteen minutes would have made for a better focused adventure . it's not hard to understand the appeal of mulder and scully . it also doesn't hurt that they're both likable and neither is hard on the eyes . actors david duchovny ( who's no stranger to movies ; his most recent foray being playing god ) and gillian anderson ( who is more familiar to viewers of the small screen than the large one ) are both accomplished and entirely believable in these roles . of course , we would expect no less of them , since they have been inhabiting these fictitious shells for five years . the chemistry between them is palpable , blending camaraderie and respect with a little subtle romance . having seen the movie , it's easy for me to comprehend why so many people are enamored with the series . although a lot of the material explored in the x-files isn't new or revolutionary , the style of presentation and the quality of the writing set this above most other conspiracy theory/alien invasion pictures . i won't claim that the experience of having watched this film will suddenly convert me into a weekly viewer of the tv show , but at least now i'm aware of what awaits if i choose to catch an episode . in a summer that has been characterized by over-hyped and largely pointless big-budget films , the offerings .

0	former hal hartley actress adrienne shelly directs her second feature , a low budget indie about a blind date gone bad . it's a romantic comedy which manages to show a lot of grief over the loss of a loved one . there's no bill pullman in this film so pullman clone , reg rogers , plays the main role of the dumped husband . this will turn out to be a shrill role for sheedy , who never seems like a real person . bernice talks a mile a minute and the disinterested sad sack bill finally gets a word in and nastily tells her " you're ordinary and pathetic . " i found this scene to be particularly dull and wondered why it was so scripted that bernice had to be told her granny had a lover by max and wouldn't have already have known about it , that is if she was such a caring grandchild as the film wanted her to be portrayed as . the film's quirky resolution comes at the point of a gun or two . it makes some point about getting to know the one you fall in love with . since i didn't find much comedy here ( only a lot of silliness ) and wasn't taken in with the characters or their troubles , i merely went along for the bumpy ride and tried not to wince too much at the forced comedy situations . this film could have used hartley's magical cinematic touch big time and a tighter script if it was going to take me somewhere i hadn't been before . 
2	if you fall into one of the following categories , then i think eat drink man woman should be on your must see list : if you do not fall into one of these classifications ( i fit in exactly one of them ) , then you will probably still really enjoy the show because it is ultimately about human relationships . the colors and textures are totally indescribable . the heart of the movie is not the cooking , although it is worth seeing the movie to watch it . at its core , this movie is about the relationships between a father and his daughters . more that this i will not say about this part of the plot . see it for yourself . the movie was by the director ( ang lee ) of the wedding banquet which , through my own stupidity , i missed seeing . since it was billed as a comedy , i expected this movie to be a light hearted movie . although the movie was too slow in many parts and needed much crisper editing ( tim squyres ) ; nevertheless , i left the movie wanting to know more about the people and what would become of them . the script by ang lee , james schamus , and hui-ling wang was wonderful from beginning to end . it is unrated , but would be pg i am sure . there is no profanity , not much sex , and no violence . any kid who can read could see it , but i think you would need to be 9 or 10 to understand the issues it presents enough to enjoy it . i give it * * * and recommend it to everyone , but especially to those in the categories listed in the beginning of my review . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	this is one of the dumbest films i have ever seen . garland is one stupid lady in this film . the two things that are positive about the film are : beverly garland is a looker and the film is an oddity . but this film is only for beverly garland fans , which i count myself as an unofficial member . 
2	this is a must see film for historical reasons or if you are a film buff . its cinematic influence is tremendous on so many great directors that range from fritz lang to billy wilder . so they improvised and created an eerie style that brought the artistic german expressionist movement into the film . this unique film influenced the genres of horror , children's fairy tales , and crime films from the '20s - '50s , and by using the same style of lighting and dark mood as these mystery stories , they became known as noir films after ww11 . this seemingly simple murder plot , of a crazed medieval-type of svengali , who orders his somnambulist to do his killings , is much more complex than that , and it is one of the reasons that this film has meant so much to so many different people at different time periods . by its odd style , accented mannerisms , all the actors wearing grotesque makeup , and exhibiting a stagy acting method , it becomes a very unsettling film . through its amazing sets , the film best expresses the insanity of its theme , and the story enhances this theme , as the authorities are shown to be either incompetent or uncaring , and madness proves to be the staple of the film . this is the story that the narrator is telling . but it is all so confusing , that the possibility exists the narrator is just making this whole thing up . this asylum director must have liked what he read about the evil magician , with the idea that imitation is the best form of flattery , as this book is found in his desk . but the story doesn't end on this note . they did not want a film with the message that authority is not to be trusted and should be subject to severe questioning . this story is now viewed from the point of view of a " framing device , " as it appears that all that previously happened could be derived from the narrator's deranged imagination . the last chilling words coming from dr . caligari , who is now seen as a more benevolent soul , go loosely like this : boy , have i got a cure for you . caligari , however limited in scope , is still a powerhouse of a horror film , a significant breakthrough in style and in expression : a poetical vision . even in its altered story form , the film is still spellbinding and weird , as its ambiguity makes for many interpretations . either francis or caligari could be the lunatic . this note of ambiguity , instead of spoiling the story , only adds further intrigue . this tale of lunacy smolders in our psyches and allows us to look at this story's skewed world without knowing all the answers . we are left wondering if there could ever be justice in this world , as corrupt powers always seem to have a way of covering up their misdeeds . 
2	no , he's not talking about the year 2000 software problem . in director john boorman's classic 1972 film , lewis is generally weary of everything electrical and mechanical . before the movie he spoke about its filming , telling us how physically exhausting the shoot was . they made a decision to film all of the river scenes only on overcast days , so they could get just the right threatening look that they wanted . sometimes they had to wait for hours for a little cloud to block out the sun before they could roll the cameras . in addition they used long lenses which magnified the effect of the speed and the action , thus intensifying the drama . this hauntingly tranquil banjo music will reappear periodically during the movie as will scenes of the placid sections of the river . and there will be peaceful shots of roaring campfires and of the river at twilight , all to provide sharp contrast to the horror of their journey . when things first go just slightly wrong , ed suggests that they play golf instead of taking the canoeing vacation -- advice that they will all wish that they had taken . " i think downstream would be best , don't you ? " quips lewis . having zsigmond present at the screening made us more conscious than normal about the cinematography . even though we were watching a washed out , old print , the brilliance of his techniques were still easy to recognize . consider just two examples . the viscerally gripping film , which begins with a foreboding peace , ends with a frightening one . all appears well , but it isn't and never will be for the men who survive . it is rated r for intense violence , graphic gore and rape and should be considered nc-17 , a rating that they did not have at the time of the movie's release . 
2	running time : 150 minutes . potential viewers who may be scared away from boogie nights by its subject matter , take note : you're not likely to find a more potent morality tale anywhere this year . the milieu may be the pornography industry of the late 1970s and early 1980s , but those with prurient interest need not apply . boogie nights is that rare example of riveting film-making which also instructs , so unobtrusively you almost can't tell you're being instructed . never has the self-delusional narcissism of the " me decade " been portrayed with such an eye to the repercussions . boogie nights does a spectacular job of re-creating its era , with its pee-chee folders , 8-track tapes and fresca , but its greater triumph is making the tunnel vision of its characters both hilarious and pathetic . when jack's sincere pronouncement that he longs to make story-centered sex films clashes with our glimpses of the mechanical , blank-faced films he is creating , it's enough to make you laugh out loud ; when dirk proudly shows off his " imported italian nylon " print shirts , it's like watching a smug dinosaur blissfully unaware of his own impending extinction . the characters in boogie nights have no sense that everything they do and everything they enjoy will soon be considered utterly ridiculous -- or worse , that they will cast a shadow over the rest of their lives . that is exactly what happens as boogie nights blasts into the 80s with a literal bang . the pace flags somewhat in the second half hour , but in a way it had to -- after the coke-fuelled pool parties , all that remains to show us is the inevitable , painful hangover . appropriately , there isn't much about the final 45 minutes of boogie nights which could be considered " fun . " cautionary story-telling rarely gets this grim , electrifying and compelling . the most talked-about moment in boogie nights will probably be the final shot , in which wahlberg finally displays the equipment ( prosthetically-enhanced , if you must know ) which has been the subject of so much discussion through the rest of the film . it would be easy to consider that moment gratuitious , but it would be just as inappropriate as thinking of boogie nights just as a movie about the porno business . in effect , the whole film is about the ultimate " dick thing , " a group of people who simply can't see the world beyond what's going on between their legs . dirk's pep talk to his own genitalia undercuts the seemingly idyllic conclusion which precedes it -- it turns out he hasn't really learned much of anything . viewers , on the other hand , have a chance to learn more than they might expect from boogie nights . . . for instance , that sometimes a sex film isn't just a sex film . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
1	while star kid isn't based on a comic book , it might as well be . however , unlike most superhero action movies , which aspire to be embraced by viewers of all ages , this feature is aimed at an exclusive sex and age group : preteen boys . but , while the picture is likely to appeal to many members of the target audience , those on the outside may be irritated by star kid's silly humor , flat characters , and juvenile writing . when it comes to live-action comic books , this is uninspired fare . giggles ) , most of what goes on during star kid is strictly generic and by-the-book . it's worth noting that , while the special effects aren't state of the art , they're pretty impressive considering the film's low budget . if you're looking for top-notch acting by " name " stars , this isn't the right movie . the most impressive performance in star kid is given by a special effect ( cy ) . joseph mazzello is adequate as spencer , but his work here doesn't come close to his impressive turn in shadowlands ; instead , it's more in line with his listless jurassic park output . the other actors are adequate , and one or two of the faces may look vaguely familiar , but no one is likely to get another job based exclusively on their dubious accomplishments here . if the premise -- a human being gaining superpowers as a result of a special costume ? sounds familiar , that could be because it was the idea behind last year's shaquille o'neal feature , steel . however , while the basic plot is a retread , at least the dialogue transcends the level of nonstop , predictable clich ? s . although there's nothing in star kid that's likely to be mistaken for modern-day shakespeare , surprisingly few of the lines are cringingly awful . in fact , from time to time , the characters in this movie speak like real people . one thing that star kid has going for it is that it's rarely boring ( although the repetitious climactic battle goes on for about 10 minutes too long ) . that's because of the notoriously short attention span of the target audience . twenty years ago , i suppose i would have enjoyed this movie . since then , however , my tastes have matured , and now i demand a little more intelligence and sophistication than star kid offers . unless you're a boy between the ages of about 8 and 13 , you're likely to find little of interest in this picture . - ingmar bergman 
1	the science fiction/action arena is littered with entries of varying quality , from the pulse pounding excitement of aliens to the plodding and ill-conceived split second . if elements of no escape sound vaguely familiar to those of last year's fortress , don't be disturbed . this movie is far more watchable . most of the script , which is based on richard herley's the penal colony , is reasonably intelligent--or at least it doesn't astound with its lack of intelligence . the biggest plot problem is the existence of absalom . it's never made clear exactly what the prison island's purpose is , or how it was established . not that this is the only " detail " glossed over by no escape . of course , many of the explanations could have been snipped from the final print . it's clear that the editors went to work on no escape . even at a two hour running length , it has all the marks of a pruning job . in most cases , especially the action sequences , this has been expertly done , but it's apparent that a fair amount of what was committed to film didn't make it to the screen version . the first half hour is reminiscent of a futuristic the fugitive in that it doesn't give the viewer much opportunity to catch his or her breath . during the final three-quarters of no escape , bursts of action occur , but nothing--not even the climactic battle--rivals the opening for generating tension . ray liotta might seem an odd choice for an action hero . after all , he doesn't have schwarzenegger's biceps , stallone's monosyllabic speech patterns , van damme's accent , or lundgren's woodenness . in fact , liotta is an actor--and a pretty good one at that . nevertheless , despite this apparent " disadvantage " , he's reasonably convincing . i think it's the steely eyes and no-nonsense expression . it certainly isn't the few obligatory ( and lame ) one-liners he's forced to utter . development of captain robbins' character is spotty , and the movie arguably might have been better had he remained ambiguous . the supporting actors , as is often the case , vary from good to bad . lance henriksen , who is making a career appearing in these sorts of films , is merely adequate , as is ernie hudson as a mirthless head-of-security . michael lerner is miscast as the nasty warden--his sneer isn't good enough . far better is stuart wilson , who steals far too many scenes from liotta and everyone else , as the deliciously evil satan of absalom , merak . the worst performance belongs to kevin dillon , whose whiny , poorly-realized casey should have been excised from the screenplay . filmed in australia , no escape boasts gorgeous scenery , and it's easy to accept absalom as a lush hell . the special effects are believable , although not plentiful . and those members of the audience who don't like rats will have to close their eyes during one very creepy scene . no escape is effective , but not superlative . the more you think about it , the less it holds together , but this is not a motion picture designed to withstand careful scrutiny . put simply , no escape is meant to be an escape and , as such , it meets all the necessary requirements . 
1	cast : marian kunonga , ulla mahaka , norman madawo , moise matura director : ingrid sinclair producers : simon bright , joel phiri screenplay : ingrid sinclair with barbara jago and philip roberts cinematography : joao costa music : philip roberts with dick " chinx " chingaira and keith goddard flame , the first feature from british-born film maker ingrid sinclair , takes on the age-old issue of image versus reality in war , and how there is a price to be paid for even the most celebrated victories . life in the military is hard , and , contrary to romanticized perceptions of it , there's far more brutality and ugliness than glory and adulation . this is a lesson that all soldiers must learn at one time or another , and a scenario that , because of its inherent strength , has been dramatized for the screen countless times before . but , while the themes and ideas presented in flame are not unique , the setting and characters are . if there's a constant in the military , it's that men dominate the field of battle . regardless of the culture and time period , this has always been true , and the male bias of armies makes it especially difficult for would-be female soldiers . at its heart , flame is less about war in general than about how the experience of being in the line of fire changes personalities . in general , flame falters whenever a sequence demands a forceful display of emotion . neither the director nor her actors appear capable of elevating the production to that more critical level . while flame is interesting because of its unique perspective on a war that many north americans know little about and its recognition of the contribution of women soldiers , it lacks the emotional depth necessary to transform it from a competent motion picture to a remarkable one . sinclair is a widely-respected documentary film maker , so it comes as a surprise that one of flame's flaws is that it doesn't seem real enough . there isn't much attention to detail -- sinclair is interested in telling her story , but not fine tuning it to the point where the audience develops more than a cursory sympathy for the main characters . a film with such broad , rich material should touch an audience on a more fundamental level than the intellectual one . flame never quite manages to accomplish that , making the experience of watching it worthwhile but incomplete . 
1	when don pedro agrees , serafin tells the audience that i am macoco . there are several surprises in the works and an outstanding dance number by the nicholas brothers . this highly entertaining film overcomes its stagy plot with some lively cole porter tunes , gorgeous costumes and scenery design , and a lot of energy from the talented cast . all told , this an enjoyable and lighthearted work , one of the director's minor works . 
2	not since robert altman's the player has a film been this relentless in its satirical attack . the great white hype takes the boxing industry and rips it open , displaying the rotting , putrid innards for all to see . there are times when this movie is so vicious that it ceases to be funny . while the great white hype has its share of comical , occasionally-hilarious moments , don't expect a non-stop laughfest on par with this is spinal tap . co-writer ron shelton is no stranger to sports movies -- he scripted five before this ( three of which he directed ) : the best of times , bull durham , white men can't jump , cobb , and blue chips . shelton is familiar with the behind-the-scenes machinations , and this knowlege is crucial to the film's success . the great white hype works primarily because its excesses aren't far removed from reality . perhaps the most disturbing thing about the movie is the recognition of how true-to-life the most outlandish and absurd aspects are . that's the question roper's would-be-rival-in-the-ring , marvin shabazz ( michael jace ) would like answered . the pay-per-view revenue for roper's last fight is down -- way down . the money isn't rolling in the way it used to , and sultan knows the reason . they need a white hero -- someone with a " clean-cut " , " all- american " image . and , sultan adds , if he doesn't exist , " i'll create him . " and , although jackson's performance is the one to watch , everyone else is more than capable , especially damon wayans , who finds the right balance between seriousness and comedy . ably directed by reginald hudlin ( boomerang ) , the great white hype never lets up with its pummeling of the boxing industry and its image- obsessed attitudes . the film also presents a timely message about how racial divisiveness can be exploited in sports ( especially boxing ) to bring in big bucks . shelton and tony hendra's script sparkles with nasty , incisive wit -- their pens were sharpened to finely-honed points before they began this skewering . and the boxing match at the end is actually suspenseful , because we don't know how things are going to turn out -- there's potential for more ridicule no matter who wins or loses . there are occasions when the great white hype goes too far , and rarer instances when it doesn't go far enough , but those moments are only apparent upon close examination . this movie isn't the unqualified success that the player or spinal tap were -- both of those films had more artistry than is evident here -- but the great white hype is still the kind of first-rate satire that would make jonathan swift proud . by the time this hyper-energetic , unapologetically politically incorrect motion picture draws to a close , boxing has been dealt a knock-out punch . 
0	a sensuous romantic comedy , about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom . there is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out , its the kind of stuff i've seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny . the film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen ? lope cruz , who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations , the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot , but who can't get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story . pen ? lope was wonderful in pedro almod ? var's " all about my mother , " but here she is so visible in such a stale story , where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking , that she somehow looks ridiculous , as if she got egg all over her face . the best you can say about her , is that she's not to blame for this picture being so off . this exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex , is in my opinion , worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will . we don't see her in flight , so i can't tell how she handled her motion sickness problem -- unless she flew the plane . the show gets so big , that the network honchos come onboard , taking it national . these tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos , they were revolting . it was an insult to one's intelligence . i'm sure that i'm not spoiling the ending for anyone , when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again . it was so awkwardly done , that it had no sense of truth or humor to it . this film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film , because it doesn't look or feel like an almod ? var film , the type of film it aspired to be , but more like a film that was interferred with from above . its more like a futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic , as it searches for box office heaven . 
2	shown at the philadelphia festival of world cinema running length : 1 : 50 mpaa classification : not rated ( mature themes , profanity ) cast : veronica forque , fernando valverde , antonio valero , antonio resines director : mario camus screenplay : mario camus cinematography : jaume peracaula music : sebastain marine distribution unknown in spanish with subtitles like hal hartley's amateur , courage develops as a noir thriller while simultaneously spoofing the genre . this film has all the right elements : a dark , evocative atmosphere , double and triple-crosses , multi-million dollar scams , and an appealing heroine . it's a difficult task to pay homage to a film style while simultaneously parodying it . however , director mario camus establishes the perfect tone , leading to an entertaining romp through familiar-seeming territory that is subtly transformed by his lighthearted methods . courage displays a lot of offbeat humor as it toys with typical noir plot elements . the ending is such a masterpiece of timing and trickery that it may surprise even thriller veterans . don't expect the traditional here -- camus shuns anything remotely somber and his heroine is far from the usual femme fatale . the result is a film that never takes itself too seriously , and , consequently , is a whole lot of fun to watch . 
1	for the movie's 60th anniversary , disney has devised an almost all-new film ; only mickey's famous " sorcerer's apprentice " segment remains . fantasia , perhaps cinema's most beloved musical montage , has not merely been updated . it has an entirely new medium for its latest incarnation . disney decided that they would shoot it in imax , a format normally reserved for films in which the viewers vicariously risk their lives climbing mountains ( everest ) or riding roller coasters ( thrill ride ) . the resulting film , fantasia/2000 , is a real treat for the ears . it is in the visuals that the movie comes up so short that it has to be labeled a disappointment . given the three-dimensional realism that we've seen this past year from disney ( tarzan ) , pixar/disney ( toy story 2 ) and other studios ( the princess mononoke ) , most of the illustrations in fantasia/2000 look flat and uninviting by comparison . then there is the choice of imax as the medium , which might seem a cute idea but turns out to be a fundamental mistake . blown up several stories high , the animation's flaws are magnified . what should be compelling instead turns out to be too busy and garish as gigantic images flash across the screen . mickey's segment , especially , suffers by being stretched . why they didn't repaint the colors is a mystery because it leaves this episode looking needlessly dated due to its grainy texture . when it ends , they cut to a properly colored mickey , which just emphasizes the inadequate restoration of the original portion . fantasia/2000 isn't a bad movie , just one with so much potential that it causes you to dwell on its flaws . take the whale sequence . as these beautiful animals frolic and splash in the ocean , the director decided not to include any sound effects . normally such a scene would have had some realistic water sounds overlaid with the music . without them , the piece has a strangely remote and detached feeling . go in with low expectations , try not to be too demanding when it comes to the animation and fantasia/2000 will prove a pleasant enough experience . just try to forget how good it could and should have been . it is rated g and would be fine for all ages , although many kids will be bored as there is little plot to hold their attention . my son jeffrey , age 10 , liked the movie enough to give it * * 1/2 . it was so different for him that he didn't know quite what to make of it or how to rate it . he liked most of the segments , except the ending one , which he found too fast and confusing . 
1	worse still , the only thing about live and let die to weather the test of time is its title song ( written by paul & linda mccartney , and performed by wings ) . without kgb agents and the threat of worldwide destruction , this 007 adventure seems lame and misplaced . live and let die sees roger moore groping for the right tone for his bond -- half the time , he appears to be attempting to imitate connery ( although this could be the fault of the screenplay ) . at least moore has a modicum of screen presence , which is more than can be said of two other bonds : lazenby and dalton . of all the bond adventures , this is the most dated . one look at the film and it's obvious it was filmed in the '70s . george martin's score only adds to the " leisure suit flavor " , proving that the definitive bond composer is john barry . ( this was the first 007 feature that barry didn't have a direct hand in scoring . ) as is often the case with bond movies , this one runs too long . there is a speedboat chase that , aside from being executed in a pedestrian fashion , goes on forever . watching live and let die isn't a complete waste of time , but there's no overriding reason why anyone should go out of their way to see it unless they're a die-hard bond fan or are curious about roger moore's first turn in the role . 
2	in an era when movies are again turning to classic literature for inspiration , it was only a matter of time before a new version of charlotte bronte's jane eyre reached the screen . one of the best-loved of all the victorian novels , jane eyre combines social commentary with gothic romance . this new film , directed by franco zeffirelli ( best known for his 1968 oscar-nominated romeo and juliet ) , remains faithful to the original narrative in general , if not in all the particulars . of necessity , the story has been condensed , since it isn't possible to reproduce a full-length book as a two-hour movie . screenwriters zeffirelli and hugh whitemore have elected to retain jane eyre's full scope while elimiting many of the nuances . the result is a reasonably fast-paced story ( with a confused sense of time ) that occasionally struggles to develop its characters to their maximum potential . ultimately , this film is on par with the 1944 orson welles/joan fontaine version . jane eyre is a love story , but , instead of the lighter romance and humor of jane austen's novels , this tale is marked by stark realism and a pervasive sense of misery . the meticulously accurate settings and beautiful-but-gloomy cinematography establish the atmosphere . even the daytime scenes are drab and colorless , and many of the interior shots are so dark that it's difficult to see the characters' expressions . there's no doubt that one of the reasons jane eyre is so cheerless is because the shadows are often more important than the light . at least in the end , there is a moment of joyful catharsis . with one exception , the acting is excellent . his is a passionless portrayal of a tragic figure . the venerable joan plowright plays mrs . fairfax with grandmotherly goodwill . it's about obligations and taking responsibility for one's actions . and , most of all , it's about the maturation of an unloved girl into a sensitive woman . jane eyre features one of literature's most independent , strong-willed female protagonists in a narrative brimming with repressed emotion and dark secrets . zeffirelli's picture fits nicely into the recent spate of films based on classic novels . it's a vast improvement over last year's hack job of the scarlet letter , but not as impressive as the " jane austen trio " ( persuasion , sense and sensibility , and the bbc/a&e pride and prejudice ) . nevertheless , for bronte aficionados , lovers of victorian romance , or those who simply appreciate literate love stories , jane eyre offers two hours of quality entertainment . 
1	dark city is a sci - fi/noir thriller , that portends to deliver a message relating to the powers of the mind and the meaning of identity . everything attempted here has been done before , but that still doesn't take away from the film's feeling of looking like it is an original . credit must go to the creative use of special effects and the outstanding set designs used for its bedimmed city . and since he is not sure if he did it or not , he has a dazed look on his puss , like he will have throughout the entire film . hurt is the deadpan , hard - nosed type of movie cop you would see in a 40s noir film , leading the investigation . he will be on the run for the remainder of the film , innocent though he may be , just like a protagonist in earlier noir films , questioning authority and trying to pull himself together , unsure of whom to trust . his visit to the automat brought back pleasant memories of my childhood in nyc , but this automat was cheerless and cold , only its bright lights served as a sharp contrast to the dark eeriness of this city . he falls in love with her anyway , and the message of the film becomes only too clear , it is in the heart that the individual is born , and the heart can't be dissected and experimented with like a science blinded by technology and ignorant of the imagination . proyas has created a visually challenging movie , that is backed - up by some thoughtful ideas . it is the kind of film that ufo'ers and alien watchers will tell ya' , see , i told you there was life out there in space . but to others , this is still only pedestrian stuff , it is not the real deal . and the flat acting did not add anything positive to the story . i enjoyed the film for its ambience and for the creative mood it set . but what diminished its positives , was how the main purpose of the actors seemed to be , to spout robotic messages for the characters they were portraying . i wished that proyas had enough confidence to allow his visions to do the talking . 
2	when a book like michael ondaatje's " the english patient " wins awards and then goes on to become a major motion picture , it raises the old question of should you read the book before you check out the film . this assumes , of course , that you haven't already read the novel before the studios decide it is movie material . into the press screening yesterday most of the critics had their copies tucked under their arms like fundamentalist christians and their bibles . in theory i'd like to read the book in advance , but i rarely do . in the case of the english patient i am glad i didn't . because i didn't , i had no idea where the movie was going , but i did know that i was entranced by the voyage it was taking me on , and i was happy not to know its mysteries in advance . during this review , i will do , as i always do , and tell you none of the key twists and certainly less than the trailers and most professional reviewers will . some movies evoke a single word , and the english patient is one . the word here is enigma . each of the characters start as enigmas not only to the audience , but to themselves . by the end of the film , the mysteries are resolved , the characters have stolen your heart , and two great romances have blossomed . this is considerable more than the sum of three normal films . " my organs are packing up . i'm a bit of toast , " he warns hana . the tuxedoed geographers view this as an thrilling romp . the mark of great actors is what they can do with just their eyes . fiennes is far from a nazi , and thomas isn't playing her usual wallflower role . both are convincing as mysterious and sensuous romantics and adulterers . as the mark of a good author , ondaatje , and the highly literate screenplay by anthony minghella , can keep adding characters without making any of them superficial and without confusing the audience . in this show , that has the scope , feel , and look of lawrence of arabia , even more characters are introduced . the desert is a star of the film as much as the actors , and it is just as perplexing . i could write the whole review on the cinematography , but let me just dwell on a couple of highlights . the rose-hued scenes of the desert in the morning and evening glow and by light of the campfires at night is stunning , and the aerial sequences are breathtaking . seale's camera is perhaps best as it caresses the actors in the close-ups . he creates many scenes of precious beauty . gabriel yared's music is dreamy , romantic , and majestic with lots of harps solos , violins , and staccato piano . all of the acting is incredible , but none is on par with fiennes . his intensity is almost that of a james wood , and yet he hardly speaks . katherine complains to the count that , " you speak so many bloody languages , and you never want to talk . " director anthony minghella ( truly madly deeply ) has crafted a masterpiece with the english patient . this is an absorbing and moving cinematic experience with a single flaw . eventually , it does end . the english patient runs 2 : 42 which is just the right length . very few films need to be longer than two hours , but this one does . it is true epic . the film is rated r for some war violence , some sex , some nudity , and a little bad language . it is a great and absorbing picture and fine for teenagers . i loved this show . i give the film my highest recommendation and award it a full * * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

" and those are only the ones suitable for print . there are elements of the film that don't work . neither of the actors is all that impressive , and when moreau isn't sharing the screen with them , things start to drag . the old lady also suffers from a bookend problem--that is to say , it opens and closes weakly . the middle section is by far the strongest , with moreau in full bloom , serrault in full bluster , and the banter zipping back and forth between them . beneath all the stinging dialogue , the old lady uses its trio of grifters to examine various questions about love , sex , passion , and friendship . the deepest , most lasting relationships that develop throughout the course of the movie don't involve sex . the film is more about intimacy than physicality , and how the two don't necessarily go together . or has it ? as far as imported fare goes , there's nothing astounding about the old lady , but it is a chance to view another fine performance by france's " grande dame " of film . 
2	none of us know where we are going , could be the theme for this road movie , which is more intense and somber than most other movies of this ilk . their dreamlike odyssey , nevertheless , continuing , ever moving northward . the subtle answer , probably lies in what lies beyond the mist , there must be something to believe in , even if you can't see it . the camera work is stupendous , capturing in total the dreamlike quality of the film . we witness a wedding in the snow , a giant hand of creation being lifted out of the sea by a crane , and the innocent kids gazing out at a world of adults that is incomprehensible to them . the mood is so harsh , even biblical in scope , that when it asks the question in its voice-over , " if i were to shout , who would hear me ? " this film is not a soapy hollywood production , it is a film that is meant to haunt us , to make us ask questions that we cannot easily answer .

" such is often the case for life stories brought to the screen with heartfelt realism . aided by a fine cast giving unaffected performances , gorris has fashioned a rare and wonderful world capable of provoking both laughter and tears -- sometimes at the same time . 
2	possibly the best british noir film ever made , a film adapted from the graham greene novel . the tourist bureau was so afraid that this gloomy look at brighton would scare off tourists , that the film opens with a " crawl " telling what a safe and jolly playground community brighton now is . in fact , he is more sympathetic to the killer in the film , no matter that he is a certifiable maniac . while he is too far gone , to do anything about what is right or wrong in the world . ida shoots back that people never change- " i haven't . " the last scene in the film is one of those memorable ones that just can't be easily forgotten . it has a raw power in it that a noir film commands when the dark side of human nature unfolds so suddenly onscreen , even if the scene was changed from the one in greene's novel . further saying , " i got his voice-i got proof of his love . " we have to hope and pray . when rose puts the record on , we have already heard what pinkie said and wait to see her reaction , but when she plays the record : " what you want me to say is i love you , " the record gets stuck and plays that over and over , until the final shot of the film is of the crucifix on the wall , with rose , seemingly , elated to have her love reaffirmed by such a positive proof . this cynical ending is perfect . the filmmakers thought it could be construed as possibly a happy ending for the filmgoers who thrive on a happy ending overcoming the general despair of the film . but the film was a failure at the box office . the only weakness in the film was the awkward pacing of the story and the over inflated role of hermione baddeley . it was a brassy portrayal that detracted from the noir mood of the film . richard attenborough's manic performace as a psychopathic , androgynous character , who had violent mood swings , was pulsatingly brilliant . his sadomasochistic relationship with the naive rose , coupled with dark shots of the seamy side of brighton , plus the expressionistic studio shots , gave the film a raw energy that makes it more powerful than the usual gangster film . if you have any kind of feel for noir films , this one is in the don't miss category . 
2	most of the time , it won't be anything flashy or exotic--just a normal tale of the minor ups and downs of day-to-day life . the last good time , the latest effort from actor-turned-director bob balaban ( my boyfriend's back ) , chronicles one of those simple-yet-affecting stories . approached with less sensitivity and intelligence , this movie could have been exploitative . however , there is nothing salacious about the last good time ; instead , it's an examination not so much of sexuality , but of friendship , need , and platonic love . the scenario is touching and tender , without a hint of artifice . there's no variety , but the unceasing blandness gives him a measure of comfort . there is a certain degree of sexual tension in their relationship , but it's neither provocative nor gratuitous . veteran actor mueller-stahl shows tremendous range in a role that demands the expression--and repression--of a variety of emotions . much of joseph's inner self is conveyed to the audience through body language and facial expressions . dialogue is used exclusively as a supplement ( in fact , it's over eight minutes into the movie before mueller-stahl speaks a word ) . olivia d'abo , while not given the opportunity to show the same breadth of character as her more experienced co-star , displays impressive depth . in what is by far her best screen performance to-date , d'abo uses charlotte's raw energy to ignite her scenes . this memorable performance is all the more surprising coming from an actress who hasn't previously shown such ability . these two actors provide the lion's share of the last good time's low-key humor . supporting the fine performances and well-crafted script is the evocative and atmospheric cinematography of claudia raschke . the dynamics of joseph and charlotte's interactions are , after all , the central focus of the last good time . the filmmakers' willingness to proceed with patience , allowing the drama to unfold naturally , affords the audience an opportunity to experience a marvelously complex , character-based study of two apparently-dissimilar people who recover lost fragments of their selves through each other . like before sunrise , the last good time has proven to be one of early 1995's most pleasant surprises . 
2	go by doug liman , the director of swingers , is three fast-paced black comedies for the price of one with each fascinating enough to stand on its own . with shades of pulp fiction , very bad things and lock , stock & 2 smoking barrels , the movie's hip dialog by john august leaves few dull moments . it's proudly crude and vulgar and full of twists as each group's plans goes horribly awry . the director manages to stage the car chases there in ways that seem fresh , no small feat for such an overused part of the action drama repertoire . the camerawork is as energetic as the story itself , and the sets are suitably eclectic with ronna's car and all of its christmas lights being one of the best . although most of the movie's gifts are comedic , it does provide some practical guidance for choosing your next car . if you're anticipating the need to transport dead bodies , a miata is not the car for you . it is rated r for drug usage , nudity , sex , profanity and violence and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
1	in his short career , mark wahlberg has been most effective when playing characters full of na ? ve sincerity . in boogie nights , the yards , and even three kings , his talent is in making the audience believe he's a good guy with a lot of heart , just trying his best . the problem with the film lies in director stephen herek's inability to take advantage of the strengths that wahlberg displays . herek ( bill and ted's excellent adventure , mr . holland's opus ) , directing a screenplay from crazy/beautiful director john stockwell , does rely on wahlberg's sincerity at first -- we easily sympathize with chris' work ethic and passion -- but doesn't allow it to carry the movie later , when the film could really use it . from that point on , rock star unfortunately takes itself a little too seriously , taking time to document stuff we've already read about ( it is a full 15 years later , after all , and hair bands like motley crue have been telling these stories for a while ) . rock star would've been better off as a bigger satire of the time , ripping into the music , the people , and the period , and allowing wahlberg's wide-eyed , once-in-a-lifetime experiences to anchor the movie's emotional honesty and sympathy . aniston could have certainly contributed to that ; i can't imagine too many people staring into those expressive eyes on the big screen and not empathizing with the woman . that would go a long way in getting us deeper into the characters , but it doesn't happen . herek does direct the concert scenes with a certain urgency and is able to capture that arena rock experience , as cool or ridiculous as you might think it is . but as chris finds his way in the final act , the movie breaks down a bit , more interested in having us feel good than actually being sincere to the story . they should've asked mark wahlberg about sincerity -- he knows how it should work . rating : * * * |------------------------------| \ * * * * * perfection \ \ * * * * good , memorable film \ \ * * * average , hits and misses \ \ * * sub-par on many levels \ \ * unquestionably awful \ |------------------------------| 
2	bill murray is a wonderful comic who has trouble picking decent scripts . at his best , as in groundhog day , his delicious brand of wry humor provides one delightful moment after another . but without the right material , as in larger than life and many other recent pictures of his , he tries to ham it up too much in order to make up for the film's lack of natural humor . in these latter movies , the result is bad slapstick . the man who knew too little , which bears no relationship to the man who knew too much , provides the perfect vehicle for murray's talents . clearly enjoying his part , murray takes this one-joke movie and milks the joke for all it's worth . although the hilarious groundhog day was a classic one-joke movie , comedies with a single idea are the hardest to sustain . nothing fazes wallace including a real mugging . with any actor other than murray , the audience would probably grow tired of the story within the first half hour . but his subtle and serious approach to the humor provides at least one big laugh every ten minutes and lots of little ones in-between . whalley , one of the most beautiful actresses working today , has talent that is rarely utilized effectively . even in bad films , such as trial by jury , she has managed to stand out . " do you think i look silly in this outfit ? " " i could take it off if you like . " the occasional sexual innuendo never gets much stronger than this , allowing director jon amiel to bring in the picture with just a pg rating . given that his last film was the excellent , but hard r picture , copycat , amiel shows more versatility than most directors . the man who knew too little is a film more to be savored in person than discussed after the fact . " but there's a downside . well , actually not , but one must keep up one's image . it is rated pg for language , innuendo , and comic violence . kids need to be ten to appreciate the humor but the film would be acceptable for those a bit younger as well . 
2	you have to know what you can expect from writer david e . kelley -- and what you _can't_ expect -- to have a chance of enjoying the determinedly quirky lake placid . he delights in creating eccentric characters , giving them outrageous things to say , and hoping that our amusement and affection for those characters will carry us through stories where his main goal is making a social statement . this isn't a master of plotting we're talking about here . if you can swing with kelley's off-beat sense of humor , you're in good shape ; if not , you're in for a long night of eye-rolling and teeth-grinding . for lake placid , his first thriller , kelley abandons the social commentary entirely to give his goofy characters plenty of room to work , in a genre where plotting isn't particularly vital . the result is an occasionally hilarious insult comedy only occasionally interrupted by a monster movie . the combination of tightly-wound urbanites and laconic locals provides most of the comic fodder in lake placid . when it works , it works wonderfully , particularly when platt and gleeson square off . platt always shines when given the role of the big-mouth , making him an ideal actor for kelley's tart zingers . gleeson , meanwhile , lends keough a restraint and dignity you wouldn't expect from a character who's a skeet for put-downs . movie-goers who can enjoy a film simply by revelling in quotable lines , including a sly shot at woody allen's infamous " the heart wants what the heart wants " comment , are in for a real treat those expecting something akin to an actual thriller , on the other hand , are in for a disappointment . the first hour of lake placid includes a couple of graphic dismemberments and a few animal carcases , but not much else in the way of scares . in fact , the entire premise generally seems like an excuse to put these four characters in the same place and let them snipe at each other . and as clever as kelley's writing can be , it's distracting when he calls attention to his own cleverness ( a notion to which any number of " ally mcbeal " detractors can attest ) , or grows infatuated with the lack of restrictions on an r-rated film's dialogue . lake placid is basically a one-type-of-joke film . how quickly one tires of that one type of joke will go a long way towards determining one's enjoyment . fortunately , kelley and director steve miner don't give that joke much chance to grow tired , wrapping up the proceedings in a tidy 80 minutes . that includes a corker of a conclusion , with more tension and narrow escapes in five minutes than in the rest of the film combined . the climax is almost enough to fool you into thinking lake placid was actually a thriller , instead of a farcical comedy with expensive mechanical reptiles . kelley has already proven himself a writer for very specific tastes , and lake placid isn't a tremendous stretch in his oeuvre . it is , however , very funny when it's supposed to be . you just have to be prepared for something unconventionally effective when the creator of " ally mcbeal " does jaws . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	monkeybone is the second film this week -- the other was 3000 miles to graceland -- that doesn't live up to the promise of its trailers . monkeybone is by far the better of the two , which isn't exactly high praise . the stunning visuals look like a cross with the nightmare before christmas , the bar scene from star wars and a nightmare vision of an amusement park . although the images devilishly delight the audience , the script is as dead as the afterlife , called downtown , in which most of the movie takes place . to be fair , he is a wonderfully gifted comedic actor and his failures come mainly from an inability to say no to terrible scripts . at least not unless death gives him a gold-plated exit pass . rose mcgowan does a sweet turn as kitty , stu's helper in the demented downtown . chris kattan , as a dead gymnast , gets the most laughs . if it sounds gross , it is . personally , i was impressed by kattan's acting but found the jokes merely stupid . please treat the projects that you are offered as you would a serious illness . once you receive the script , ask for a second opinion . it is rated pg-13 for crude humor and some nudity and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up . jeffrey ( * * ) said that he didn't laugh once but that he thought the plot was imaginative . maxim ( * * * ) commented on how much he liked the characters and the fantasyland part . sam ( * * * 1/2 ) said that he found the movie very funny . nickolas ( * * * 1/2 ) mentioned how interesting he found the whole setup . all of them liked the organ donor part . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
0	the best part of the film , is that it did capture the east village feel of the reagan 1980s . but , for the most part , this was a dull film that had nothing to say and soon wore out its welcome as the story became insipid and the characters grating . in the end , the film proved to be as shallow as the characters were . director risa bramon garcia , making her debut after a successful career as a casting director , seems to be more interested in getting the pop music of the 1980s heard and the bizarre dress of party goers viewed , than in telling a cohesive story . in this ensemble piece , there are far too many characters to really get to know them and too many sub plot developments to keep your interest . everyone fades in and out of the scene , for no rhyme or reason , each with some tale to tell . " if you relax , you can get what you want , even if you smell like dog shit . " the film is almost bearable when it just goes for the look and feel of the times , but when it tries to pontificate , such as when it sums up the film by comparing relationships to the way smokers have a need for cigarettes , and asks the question from the pair that got the most screen time , rudd and love , " why are people so scared of each other ? then i felt the party was really over and this mtv produced story faded out with not one interesting character in the film . i bet you a dollar to a donut , that you could have gone to most any other new year's eve party in manhattan and met more interesting people ! 
2	dennis schwartz " movie reviews and poetry " whether the story is entirely true or in some parts made up , as the director stated it is , is unimportant ; the film covers the intriguing subject matter of how four single new yorkers exist for a period of nine months , featuring the real lives of two female and two male actors who play themselves , concerned with getting older and still being single . their single scene is provocatively portrayed as being sad and luridly comical . that these four are not particularly people that i can readily sympathize with , does not alter the fact that this is a very human story being told , one that has many implications on our culture , relating how alienated a people so many of us have become in this modern world . the result is an interesting and stylized docudrama , a " rear window " for singles . this time it is not a crime that we see , but is a voyeurist's delight , and there is something that seems to excite us when we sneak a look at what someone does in the privacy of their own home , as if we are seeing something about them that we shouldn't see . but it is the four singles who remain the focus of the film , which is really not a documentary , except in its style . this could be a personal ad about her , if it also included that she wants a guy not for sex or love ( she can have sex whenever she wants to ) , but for monetary reasons . michael de stephano is the nicest one of the four , except this little negative fixation he has about homosexuals . he is serious , stable , and straightforward , and sounds a lot like what women want in guy , but he says that is what they say they want , but in reality they are really attracted to the jerks who lie to them and treat them badly , going after them just for the sex . he is obnoxious but not as obnoxious as he makes himself out to be . though it is very hard to feel sympathy for him , especially after he shows us how he will get out of a date with a mutt , which in his lingo , is an ugly dog , by having someone at work beep him so he can make an excuse to leave . this film might be upsetting to some , but it is a fresh look at an old problem , and its aim is readily accomplished , as it offers us an unorthodox study in human behavior under the guise of being a documentary . 
1	a perfect world is really two movies . the main movie is a serious one staring kevin costner and an 8 year old new comer named t . j . lowther . the other movie is a comedy with clint eastwood and laura dern . the comedy takes up a full third of the movie , and it is awful and full of cliches . i am not sure how it got stuck in this picture . my only guess is that they thought the picture would be too downbeat otherwise and might be criticized for glorifying criminals . eastwood and dern should have read the ridiculous script by john lee hancock and refused the roles . since eastwood was also the producer and director , i guess he thought knew what he was doing . going for it , the serious movie has two excellent performance in the title roles . the chemistry costner and lowther is quite effective . going against it , is that the movie , except for the ending , does glorify criminal behavior , and it certainly makes you feel sorry for costner's character since he only murders for reasons he thinks are valid . interesting logic that . finally , why do movies always hold religion in a bad light , but not murdering or stealing ? you are taught in this movie to despise the boy's moma ( jennifer griffin ) because their religion does not allow trick or treating , but you are set up to applaud which he steals a halloween costume because he deserves it . sigh . a perfect world runs 2 : 18 for reasons i can not fathom . this is a little movie and should have a brief running time . the movie is rated pg-13 , but i would have given it an r for its violence and adult themes . i give the movie * * for the two lead performances but can not bring myself to recommend the show . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : january 2 , 1994 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	simplicity , sincerity , and realism are the hallmarks of ken loach's raining stones . although possessing the grittiness and rare honesty of mr . loach's previous project , riff raff , this is not a re-telling of that story . anyone familiar with the director's work , however , will recognize the characteristic style . dark locales , underexposed interiors , and actors with accents so thick that some might find subtitles helpful--all these elements are synthesized to deliver an amazingly real portrait of life as a member of middleton's unemployed and underprivileged . there's no preaching in raining stones , and the narrative never condescends to the characters , no matter what their circumstances are . this movie presents life as it is--no regrets or complaints . without ever mentioning politics , mr . loach makes the most powerful and effective of political statements--one that relies on subtlety and the intelligence of the audience . the plot is entirely believable and never predictable , simply because it goes against the grain of what typically comes out of hollywood . jim allen's script mixes portions of unforced comedy and natural tension into a deceptively straightforward tale that would find few takers in the film making mainstream . the characters are realized by little-known actors who deserve greater recognition , at least based on the strengths of their performances here . raining stones is a mirror that reflects our times , with themes that are universal . you don't have to be a resident of middleton to understand what director ken loach is saying . that there is humor and warmth in the midst of such poverty speaks volumes for the indomitable spirit of humanity , not to mention the strength of this movie's ability to capture that . 
1	inspired by the maverick finnish director aki kaurismaki's 1987 " hamlet goes business , " michael almereyda ( another girl , another planet/nadja ) directs this updated mainstream , mock serious version of hamlet with great wit , style , and immediacy . he effortlessly transfers locations from denmark to the new york city of 2000 , which shows how malleable hamlet is and how right it seems to take it away from its staginess and sole reliance on dialogue instead of making it a more cinematic experience . but what almereyda fails to do in this slenderized ( no gravediggers here ) version of hamlet , is make his modern visuals jive with the staginess of the bard's words , therefore the film always felt jarring . even in some very beautifully mannered scenes , there was a note of clumsiness , indicating something was missing or didn't match about this far-reaching production that bordered on mawkish giddiness , though not quite falling down that hole . the old style english dialogue and the new visuals did not make for a coherent film , with the visuals being spectacular and relevant , while the dialogue seemed to be from another planet , or from another venue . i thought i would never say that shakespeare's hamlet is better visually than its dialogue , but in this film version , that is clearly the case . by not changing the tone of the shakespearian dialogue to the neurotically nasal everyday speech of the modern new yorker , while radically altering the visual effects to fit in with the current times , the film developed a split-personality , which it was never able to recover from . if you are going to change things , why make half the film conform to traditional shakespeare , when you could have taken a further risk and made the entire film a glittering display of inventiveness , and perhaps achieve a major breakthrough in how to present hamlet to a modern audience ! hamlet is a troubled soul who is a struggling digital videomaker , with fits of self-importance and bouts of illusionary grandeur . hamlet has such a grungy attitude . the video is a comically haphazard avant-garde work by the animator lewis klahr , showing a variety of historical film footage . hamlet and ophelia are a perfectly beautiful looking but obnoxious couple , who are plagued by the modern problem of lack of communication . it is difficult to take this hamlet in quite the same serious way it is usually presented onstage , and that's just fine . refreshingly , this film does not have one ounce of pretention to high culture . the cast all come with their own individual ideas about the characters they are playing and offer their odd renditions for the traditional roles . hawke delivers his " to be or not to be " soliloquy in the action video section of a blockbuster store . the story , though almost cut in half , still is basically the same . but the dramatic effect is different . you have to lose something when you throw away all that shakespeare dialogue . in some scenes we look through all the egotism of the characters through glass that is crystal clear and easy to shatter , and the effect is a sharpened sense of what we are seeing . but when the final tragedy unfolds , there is no real emotion in it , the film failed to pull us into that scene . it seemed as if the soul had been taken out of it . and that is the major fault of the film . what lingers , is a strong sense that we are steeped in a hamlet who must be viewed with urgency , a sense of foreboding gloom , and with a sense of ticklish glibness . the picture was shot in super 16 millimeter . its nyc face is given a glossy , bluish and grayish tint , catching all the limos , glass closets , and glass high-rise structures john de borman could film with his superlative camerawork . nyc never looked more like a glistening denmark or a glass house , while " hamlet " looks more like a work of visual poetry instead of sounding like great literature . an interesting concept , too bad almereyda couldn't completely pull it off . yet i applaud the chances he took and all the misses never completely deterred me from enjoying the film . it came awfully close to being camp , but the oddness of this unlikely cast playing shakespeare , somehow , held the film together and made it accessible to an audience that shakespeare might not have reached before . even though hawke's hamlet had the edge of a young man's immaturity and impetuousness , what would have really given this film a sense of manic self-consciousness , would have been to cast sean penn as hamlet , though james dean in that part would have been the ultimate coup de grace . 
1	la femme nikita ( director : luc bresson ; cast : anne parillaud , jean-hughes anglade , tcheky karyo , jean reno , jeanne moreau , 1990-fr . ) an exciting and entertaining actioner that tests the plausibility of its story with an unreality check , yet is real on its emotional levels , testing the heroine's reactions to love , guilt , loss of identity , and a deprived upbringing , which is rare for this genre to be so concerned with actual human values . anne , the wife of luc , plays nikita with a flair , exhibiting the tremendous energy and orneriness needed to make the part exceptional . the film plays like an mtv special , using a splash of coloring to light up the screen and very fast paced action sequences to keep you mindlessly glued to the screen . but that is disarming , since this film has more than that to offer , even if it does not seem so during certain stretches of the film . it is worth sticking with this film , it gets better and less predictable the more you get into it . though its ending , does leave a lot to be desired . this part of the story lags , as we watch how this violent misfit channels her anti-social aggressiveness into acceptibility for her new role in life , one that society , supposedly , can appreciate . there is one great scene where we see the young nikita putting on makeup next to moreau , and we are dazzled by looking at the faces of the two stars fill-up the screen , with moreau , wrinkles and all , still looking quite sexy and alluring , and in my way of looking at things , the one who is the more alluring . so , we have come full cycle , and nikita has developed an appreciation for life that she never had before , leaving us with much moral fodder to chew on , more than most actioners leave us with , and we come to the understanding that this incredible story , that is hardly plausible , that is seemingly cartoonish , is much better than it appears on surface because somehow or other it satisfies our need to know something about covert operations and the people who go into it on a non-voluntary basis , plus the movie is very entertaining and was able to hold our attention , even through the rough spots in it . 
2	woody allen's musical everyone says i love you is a delightful and infectiously happy movie . as a film critic , i can rarely afford myself the luxury of taking the time to see a movie twice , but i made an exception for everyone says i love you . why confine the pleasure to a single setting ? allen attracts talent to his projects , but this show has even more than normal . almost everyone in the picture , as in most of allen's films , are quite well off . " how did i end up with a kid on the other end of the political spectrum ? " " how did i fail ? " woody loves poking fun at everyone . the way scott's conservative values are " resolved " in the film will undoubtedly infuriate some , but i thought it was hilarious . woody is the star of the picture as steffi's ex-husband joe . " if i took the concorde , i could be dead three hours earlier . " woody plays his usual character obsessed with death -- mahler , but funnier . being overly debonair , he confesses , " there was a moment there when i stroked when i should have hickeyed . " all of the above is great comedy , but it is the musical part that makes the film stand out . the film is like a traditional musical and unlike evita in that the musical numbers are frequent , but most of the lines are spoken , not sung . the musical numbers come from great old songs and are sung by the cast . some of them have weak voices , with woody's being the smallest , but all of them manage to provide happiness and mirth . it is hard to choose which of the musical numbers i liked best . many of them rely on choruses . easily the most imaginative musical number happens in the funeral parlor . he gathers other ghosts to sing , " enjoy yourself , enjoy yourself , it's later than you think . " the film is exceedingly beautiful , certainly the most attractive movie allen has ever made . his usual cinematographer , carlo di palma , can be credited . talking the colors from a central park in fall that has never looked lovelier , he uses that color palette for all of the photography . unlike typical allen films we also get location shots in such picturesque locales as paris and venice . everyone says i love you is a joy to behold . you leave the theater with a song in your heart and wanting to repeat the experience again . everyone says i love you runs 1 : 41 . it is rated r for a single bad word from a rap song . other than that , the film is pure pg . as soon the rap guy appears , cover your kids ears for a few seconds and the singer and his one profanity will be history . with that precaution you can take kids of any age to see the film although those under nine will probably not be interested . i strongly recommend the picture to you and give it * * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : january 31 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	cast : jean reno , mercedes ruehl , polly walker , mark frankel , robert della casa , luigi diberti director : paul weiland producers : alison owen , dario poloni , paul trijbits screenplay : saul turteltaub cinematography : henry braham music : trevor jones u . s . distributor : fine line features this comedy -- the artsy equivalent of weekend at bernie's -- gets a lot of its humor from death , dying , and the act of dragging corpses from place to place . strangely , however , while the movie is sporadically funny , it's rarely laugh-aloud hilarious , and many of the dramatic elements seem more obligatory than heartfelt . there's something dissatisfying about for roseanna -- as if it's a short that someone tried to stretch to feature length . jean reno has the comic aptitude of a charlie chaplin -- a flexible body and expressive features . sitting through for roseanna certainly isn't an unpleasant experience , but the film never goes far enough . the comedy is safe ( or as safe as it can be when the subject matter involves dead bodies ) , the romance is tepid , and the drama is restrained . aside from reno , who throws himself wholeheartedly into the role of marcello , there's no standout performance . mercedes ruehl's roseanna is actually rather dull , and polly walker ( enchanted april ) , despite being attractive , doesn't add much . those looking for romance are likely to be the most disappointed by for roseanna . as a love story , it leaves a lot to be desired . the most heartfelt emotion evident between marcello and his wife is affection -- theirs is certainly not a white-hot marriage . worse still is the relationship between cecilia and antonio , which is about as dull , passionless , and unappealing as any motion picture love affair can get . and , while there are hints of some sort of romantic tension between cecilia and marcello , it's never developed into anything tangible , which is unfortunate , because these two might have made an interesting couple . the film is clearly designed for american consumption , and will represent fine line features' summer " counterprogramming . " unfortunately , it doesn't offer more than a marginal diversion . then again , in the midst of so many action-oriented blockbusters , maybe for roseanna's uncertain blend of comedy , romance , and drama will be enough to generate interest . if nothing else , it's at least a change of pace . 
2	goldfinger has rightfully been called the best bond movie that was ever made . this film brings it all together perfectly . it has an intriguing and ingenious plot , fascinating gadgets , beautiful women , handsome men , lush scenery , great music , well paced action , and a certain indescribable magic . if spy-action films ever had a classic , then this is it . but best of all is the hidden ejector button . if his passenger is too talkative or otherwise disagreeable , all bond needs do is push a little button and his companion shoots straight up and out of the car permanently . as the non-talking oddjob , harold sakata plays a man with a body stronger than steel and a hat that appears to made of it . and , of course , who could ever forget any character who goes modestly by the name of pussy galore . what is surprising is that pussy is played by honor blackman , the first female lead on " the avengers , " not as an airhead but as one of the smarter characters in the movie . this time the gorgeous and exotic locales include the lush kentucky bluegrass country and the snow capped majesty of the swiss alps . although the alps are the more striking of the two , kentucky looks especially lovely . bond's overriding rule has to do less with his assignments than his libido . whenever a pretty woman appears , he always arranges for an extension in his schedule so he will have time for a roll in the hay -- which he does literally in a scene with pussy galore . bond sex is a special movie style . it consists of a quick but intense kiss followed by a cutaway to later . the sex is hinted at with cute puns and sexual innuendo , but never discussed explicitly . this produces enough titillation for the adults in the audience but stays harmless enough for the younger ones as well . few movies these days ( except bond pictures ) even attempt this style . " do you expect me to talk ? " " no , " goldfinger laughs . " i expect you to die ! " goldfinger runs 1 : 52 . it is rated pg for violence and sexual innuendo and would be fine for kids around nine and up . my son jeffrey , almost 9 , liked the movie a lot , especially the car and the gadgets . no better than either of them . 
1	screenplay : alvin sargent , based on the novel by mona simpson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 114 minutes . for a long time during anywhere but here , my attention was fixed somewhere i didn't quite expect . relationship dramas like this tend to be all about character and performance -- every scene is an actor's scene , every moment is an actor's moment . but to my surprise , i became fascinated with the way the film looked . the grainy film stock renders everything slightly fuzzy ; the bleached colors suck the golden glow out of tinseltown . i mean no disrespect to mr . deakins or to the craft of cinematography when i say that , even at the time , i knew anywhere but here couldn't have been working the way it was supposed to if i was paying attention to the choice of film stock . it's been done before , of course -- even the kooky mother and more stable daughter has been done before , in films like mermaids -- but solid writing and strong performances can often counteract familiarity . anywhere but here does come through with the strong performances . their scenes together effectively capture the perpetual tension between ann and adele , and do a particularly nice job of showing ann's frustration at being the real grown-up of the two while never turning her into a wise-ass . and that may be why anywhere but here feels so claustrophobic and artificial . we see ann walking uncomfortably through beverly hills high on her first day of school , but there's no sense of her struggle before she's giggling away with girlfriends ; a few scattered scenes of adele in her job as a speech pathologist/therapist provides no sense for why this flighty woman ever got into a field that demands so much patience . most disappointing , there's far too little background on their lives in wisconsin for us to understand why adele wants to leave and ann wants to stay , and far too little development of the potentially intriguing relationship between ann and her almost-kissing-cousin benny ( shawn hatosy ) . there's really not a single strong supporting character anywhere but here can bounce off of . it's no wonder these two drive each other crazy -- they've been hermetically sealed away from the rest of the world . one could argue that such an isolated , in-each-other's-face relationship is precisely the point of anywhere but here -- that ann and adele have nothing in the world but each other , crazy-making as they may be to each other . that doesn't make it any easier to spend two hours with them -- and only them -- and their conflicts , well-acted though they may be . and of course there was the cinematography , which -- while thematically appropriate -- also reminded me what anywhere but here was missing . this is a drama too lacking in background color . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
2	the best of the segments are absolutely mesmerizing , but the worst of them are seat-numbingly tedious . but like most motion pictures , the prop department never stocks umbrellas , a fact which never ceases to amaze me . although the movie has a cast of thousands , the stories are really individual ones . to underscore this , the film's killer score starts with a long and loud rendition of " one is the loneliest number . " in a fascinating performance likely to get an oscar nomination for best supporting actor , tom cruise is frank t . j . mackey , a motivational speaker for sex-crazed men who aren't getting enough . when he demands coffee in one scene , the reaction is that , if ever a man didn't need caffeine , it is frank . generally frank doesn't think much of woman as people , but he does see some value in them . robards , an actor whose talents i find highly limited , gets way too much screen time for my taste . although the film starts with great momentum , anderson loses it all by dragging it out just past three hours . the last hour , especially , is a real snoozer . never even attempting to bring the stories together into a satisfying whole , anderson instead ends the movies with a ridiculous conclusion introduced completely out of left field . magnolia runs way too long at 3 : 02 . it is rated r for strong language , drug use , sexuality and some violence and would be acceptable for older and mature teenagers . 
2	sometimes the films i enjoy the most aren't the ones i give a 9 to . for example , while farewell my concubine ( to which i gave a 9 . 5 ) is an example of superior , powerful film making , this isn't a movie to be enjoyed for the pure magic of the entertainment that it brings . grumpy old men , on the other hand , is such a film , and while it won't come close to my top 10 best list for 1993 , it will be right up there among the pictures that i had the most fun watching . while not without its problems ( some of which are readily apparent ) , grumpy old men works more often than it doesn't . it's an example of a frothy , good-natured holiday picture that adults can relax and enjoy . as a comedy , the movie is an unqualified success , with enough fresh humor to keep the laughs coming . dramatically , however , things aren't as impressive . the attempts of grumpy old men to tackle a few serious themes come across as inoffensive but trite . there are formulas at work here , and anyone admitting to be surprised by the " plot twists " should hang his or her head in shame . fortunately , drama always plays second fiddle to comedy , and this is a very funny motion picture--surely one of the most consistently amusing of the year . there's everything from slapstick to puns , with a lot of clever audio and visual gags . witness jack lemmon and walter matthau's " performances " to the song " i'm too sexy " , lemmon's send-up of macaulay culkin's aftershave scream from home alone , and the little dance number lemmon does in his underwear . the most amusing part of the film arrives at the least expected moment : during the end credits , which appear over a series of outtakes . this is one time when it's worth staying for the entire film . of course , the pair are no strangers to this sort of interplay , having done it several times before , most memorably in the odd couple . this is an example of perfect casting , as is the choice of burgess meredith as the tough- talking , dirty-minded patriarch of the gustafson family . ann-margaret is adequate as the catalyst of the newest phase in the gustafson/goldman feud , giving an energetic but not particularly memorable performance . likewise , kevin pollack and daryl hannah are kept in the background and saddled with poorly-written characters whose functions are minimal ( to her credit , ms . hannah does a pretty decent job with her material , and her unexpected competence caught me off guard ) . ossie davis , consummate professional that he is , takes a minor role and turns it into something special . most of those that attend a showing of grumpy old men will leave the theater with a smile on their face , which is basically what the movie is going for . the relatively unsuccessful dramatic elements , which are overly-sentimental and hamstrung by a too-pat resolution , are a small price to pay for everything else . this film joins recent productions such as the cemetery club and used people in delivering a more " mature " romantic comedy ( i . e . , one featuring older actors ) . however , where both of those films came across as rather hollow efforts , grumpy old men has enough vitality to see it through the thin spots . i can't think of many better ways to spend the holiday season than with john gustafson and max goldman . they may be irascible and stubborn , but they're a lot of fun--as long as you don't have to eat dinner with them . 
2	pi , the mathematical notation , is commonly used to represent the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter . pi is actually the second low-budget , no-effects science fiction movie i have seen this year . i must admit to liking the approach embraced by pi and sticky because the monetary limitations have spawned creative scripts with unique solutions . socially , max is completely inept . his objective is to use his home-built supercomputer , euclid , to analyze the patterns in the financial markets to predict the exact performance of every stock . although the plot of pi is eccentric ( even for a science fiction effort ) , aronofsky's message is actually quite simple : life does not fit into neat patterns , and complete control is impossible . oddly , this is also the underlying premise of the two jurassic park movies , proving that certain concepts are universal . however , the central theme is only one of many fascinating subjects tapped into by the screenplay . for example , max's quest to use numerical patterns to model every aspect of the universe reveals some interesting facts about the hebrew language . aronofsky elected to shoot the film in black-and-white , which lends a dream-like atmosphere to all of the proceedings . pi transports us to a world that is like yet unlike our own , and , in its mysterious familiarity , is eerie , intense , and compelling . reality is a fragile commodity , but , because the script is well-written and the central character is strongly developed , it's not hard to suspend disbelief . as the movie draws to a conclusion , it perhaps becomes a little too ambitious in trying to unify all the great questions of existence . at that point , pi slides with only limited success into an exploration of metaphysics and spirituality . nevertheless , i prefer movies that take risks like this , even when they're flawed , to those that try for a safe , formula-driven resolution . so , while i didn't necessarily buy everything that transpired in the final fifteen minutes , i was surprised by much of it , and aronofsky never lost my attention . for anyone who wants a movie to feed their intelligence and imagination more than their eyes and ears , pi is a solid choice . it probably deserves 3 . 1416 stars , but since my scale doesn't support that , i'll round it off to three . " my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . " -- david puttnam 
1	this romantic comedy about the love life of comic book writers feels like a sitcom because that is what it basically is , not withstanding , that it pushes the envelope further out by having characters in it who are more sexually active than the usual sitcom . its story is also a bit more arresting . its strongest asset being the quick-witted and acidy dialogue it brings to the table by its capable cast who are most able to deliver those punch lines . in this scene we get a good dose of the ambiance of the comic book world and we get a chance to see what their readers are like and of how serious the writers are about the work they do . banky has a blast with this explanation . our hero is not a liberated hero , but it is his flaws that give him credibility . the film gives this a surprising psychological meaning . the chasing amy is a moral fable . this scene was not needed , as the story itself was simple enough to follow . we did not need a ready made explanation of the film from the director . not everything worked or made sense , but the characters and their problems seemed real . and , the dialogue hit the mark more often than not . this is smith's third film about the travails of young people growing up in new jersey and influenced by " pop " culture . what i didn't like about the film , is that despite its attempts not to be viewed as a sitcom , that is what this film is , even if its mature story line adds more weight to it . sitcoms are just not the way i like to see drama unfolding , as it always leaves me thinking that things are still being dumbed down , that even though , these are characters we usually do not see on the screen and it is refreshing to see them ; we are , nevertheless , not going any deeper psychologically with this story and with character portrayal than other sitcoms go . smith's film does give us a real sense of a relationship and the struggle it takes to make it work , but there is still an air of superficiality about its presentation . 
2	cast : cher , chazz palminteri , ryan o'neal director : paul mazursky producers : jane rosenthal and robert de niro screenplay : chazz palminteri based on his play cinematography : fred murphy music : phillip johnston u . s . distributor : new line cinema/savoy pictures despite what the advertisements imply , faithful is less of a black comedy than a disquieting drama laced with wit . adapted by chazz palminteri from his off-broadway play , the film , as directed by paul mazursky ( down and out in beverly hills ) , unfolds like a three-act theatrical piece : lots of dialogue and not much action . only three actors have significant roles , and there are a limited number of sets . in fact , however , his trauma runs much deeper than the average person's . for over an hour , faithful allows this trio of characters to work through their problems . or does tony have the wrong address ? answering that question , however , is far less compelling than watching these characters confront their inner demons by railing against each other . cher , who hasn't done much since 1990's mermaids , is effectively subdued as maggie . he doesn't have the most screen time , but he gets all the best lines . ryan o'neal is adequate as the philandering husband , although faithful demands less from him than from the other two . at times , faithful is amusing , although most of the humor is of the gallows variety ( such as tony's objection to maggie's having a last cigarette because of the danger to him from secondary smoke ) . more importantly , the unique perspectives created by the unusual situation allow the film to offer insight into the issues of fidelity , love , and marriage . faithful has a tendency to be too talky , and each of the last two acts runs on a little too long , but this isn't an unreasonable price to pay for a movie that poses several thought-provoking questions . and , although palminteri doesn't write with the verve of david mamet , he employs enough crisp dialogue in the service of an interesting premise to keep the audience involved for most of the ninety-minute running length . 
2	screenplay/director : quentin tarantino . according to all evidence , pulp fiction is going to be one of those movies that turns people into incarnations of beavis and butthead ; either it " sucks " or it " kicks ass , " apparently with no tenable middle ground . this of course is the natural course of things for films as unique as pulp fiction . quentin tarantino's stunning sophomore effort deserves better . it is the kind of film , imperfect though it may be , which should inspire discussion about how exciting the medium can be . there are more moments in this one film which awed me to silence than in every other 1994 release combined , and while its faults may not allow it to stand as the year's best film , it's certainly close . pulp fiction is divided into segments telling interlocking tales about a group of shady characters . this is what must be said about pulp fiction : few films in the last fifteen years have left me so charged with the pure gonzo thrill of movie-making . has there been a more erotically charged conversation than that between vincent and mia at a gaudy 50's-style burger joint ? has the flushing of a toilet ever caused such a combination of laughter and suspense . and has any scene caused an entire audience to squirm quite so violently as a spectacular moment involving an overdose victim and a six inch hypodermic needle ? quentin tarantino refuses to let any moment just sit there ; relationships between characters crackle with intensity , and darkly comic punch lines are spit out like bullets . i left pulp fiction feeling as though i had not simply watched a movie , but * experienced * one . i was exhausted . however , it would be a mistake to suggest that there is nothing to pulp fiction but its visceral impact . tarantino does not place his characters in a universe of amoral anarchy ; as reservoir dogs first indicated , he is fascinated with loyalty and moments of improbable selflessness . two such moments provide the moral backbone of pulp fiction . both are showcases for career performances . willis is better than his previous work had ever so much as hinted at , while jackson delivers what is quite simply the best performance in an american film this year . it is at these moments when pulp fiction , for all its frantic energy , reveals its real message : even in a world this violent , salvation is possible . the only real problem with pulp fiction is a significant lag between the marvelous middle segment and jackson's tour-de-force monologue . but tarantino brackets that lull with such sheer cinematic glory , that the sour taste doesn't linger . pulp fiction is violent , profane and filled with addicts , racists and killers . at the same time , it may be one of the most moral stories the big screen has seen in years . that tarantino was able to pull off that little maneuver says as much about his talent as a dozen palmes d'or . 
1	it plays more like a theatrical ghost story or a greek tragedy than a western . tantoo cardinal has a minor part , even though the film is theoretically about her , as the film's title states . it's a film that revels in a dark brooding mystical flavor and of being a revisionist-type of a western rather than one of those traditional oaters . unfortunately , the film never held together in a cohesive way , and seemed forced and awkward at times . it should satisfy mostly those who are in need to see something different , something that is cultish and attuned to sam shephard's penchant for showing dysfunctional families . 
1	in writer and director juliane glantz's wilbur falls , the characters are all quirky , but none are interesting enough to care about . using it almost like an office and private meditation chamber , he spends hours there reading . the body of the movie , which you might expect to be about her worrying about being discovered and about what actually happened , is instead packed with a series of unrelated subplots . it is as if first-time writer and director glantz wanted to get every idea she ever had into her first movie . although not a bad movie , it plays more like a series of sketches that someone might show to a producer with the idea that the producer would chose which one to develop . glantz shows some raw promise in the film . hopefully her second film will be more focused and have a few compelling characters . it is not rated but would probably be an r for brief profanity , nudity , sexuality and mature themes and would be fine for teenagers . 
1	for all the talk about how safe and predictable hollywood film-making has become in recent years ( and well-deserved talk it has been ) , i think the independents have been getting a bit lazy as well . the big studios may try to duplicate the formulas of their blockbusters , but the small distributors are just as eager to duplicate the successes within their own ranks , which is why you see a lot of two kinds of film at your local art house : talky generational relationship comedies , and gritty , violent capers . many cinephiles find the former particularly annoying , but i have grown more tired of the attitude-heavy but substance-light films which worship at the altar of tarantino and turn out sour garbage like things to do in denver when you're dead . the big squeeze is a nice idea for a spin on that trend , an unspectacular but surprisingly sunny film noir -- a film blanc , if you will . i suppose that on a basic plot level not much separates the big squeeze from those same gritty , violent capers i criticized en masse . it includes sex , greed , double-crosses and characters with a certain in-your-face quirkiness , and all have an uncomfortable familiarity . what director and writer marcus deleon understands is that a change in tone can make for an entirely different story , and the big squeeze is a film which always seems to be more inviting than ominous -- jacques haitkin's cinematography is bright and cheery most of the time , mark mothersbaugh provides a bouncy score , and the characters are generally likeable . that little trick impressed me , and it is characteristic of the minor pleasures which allow the big squeeze to overcome its familiar story arc and deliberate pacing . part of what makes the big squeeze fun to watch is that benny's plan is based on completely mistaken assumptions about the other people involved -- neither tanya nor jesse is as obsessed with the money as he is , and henry may actually be _more_ obsessed with it . i wish deleon had been content with a silly subversion of noir conventions , because his attempts at more thematic depth fall somewhat flat . that is partly the result of a listless performance by lara flynn boyle , who gives tanya a flaccid personality which doesn't seem to warrant so much fascination by so many men . but for all its unevenness , the big squeeze provides an unexpected twist to a genre in which guns and gloom generally carry the day . in this case , it is a pleasant surprise to find not a single bullet fired , and every character experiencing some kind of happy ending . apparently deleon prefers to make love , not noir . 
1	cast : chris tucker , charlie sheen , paul sorvino , heather locklear , gerard ismael , elise neal , david warner director : brett ratner producer : walter coblenz screenplay : joel coen and alec sokolow cinematography : russell carpenter , robert primes music : lalo schifrin u . s . distributor : new line cinema it's getting so that it's hard to see a movie without being distracted by some star or another's off-screen antics . now , just in time for the release of his latest picture , charlie sheen has joined a list that includes names such as martin lawrence , robert downey jr . , and christian slater . all things considered , however , it probably doesn't matter much , since sheen's screen presence in this film is virtually nonexistent . this is a classic " pick up the paycheck and run " performance from someone who doesn't seem to be enjoying himself or the role he's playing . as a result , sheen's co-star , stand up comic chris tucker ( last seen prancing around a space station in the fifth element ) steals nearly every scene . in fact , tucker's in-your-face outrageousness is so pronounced that it's easy to forget that sheen is even in the movie . money talks is billed as an " action comedy " , and i suppose that's what it is . the problem is , while some of the comedy is inventive , and , at times , downright hilarious , there's nothing remotely interesting about the film's generic fight , chase , and explosion scenes . the thin plotline that binds all of money talks' elements into one cohesive whole is a little too hard to swallow , even for a movie that makes no pretense of being remotely serious or grounded in reality . there are a few complications , however . it's not hard to determine the source of money talks' inspiration . this film is a virtual regurgitation of 48 hours , with tucker doing his best to out-eddie murphy that film's star . unfortunately , given money talks' weak , derivative script , uninspired direction , and bland performance by sheen , this movie has more in common with 48 hours' horrid sequel than with the original . for a while , i thought money talks was going to be a great deal more clever than it turned out to be . at the outset , it looks like it might be shaping up as a biting satire of action films , but , as the reels unspool , it becomes obvious that first-time director brett ratner is more intent upon joining the ranks of the genre than spoofing it . there are two long car chases in this film -- both are routine and neither shows more than a hint of parody . at least chris tucker is enjoyable . his performance may be a re- harsh of murphy's , but he keeps money talks somewhat watchable . if only the same degree of brashness and energy had been evident in other aspects of the production . by playing the action sequences largely straight , money talks uses a safe approach . unfortunately , in this case , " safe " equates to " dull . " we've seen it all before , and this time , about the most excited reaction it's likely to provoke is a yawn . 
2	disney's 32nd animated feature film is its darkest since the black cauldron , and , in many ways , a departure from the light-heartedness of the little mermaid , beauty and the beast , and aladdin . there are moments of fun and humor , to be sure , but the undercurrent is of a far more serious , " adult " nature . but it's never that easy to escape the past . . . . death , something not really touched on in the last three animated disney tales , is very much at the forefront of the lion king . it is a chilling moment that is reminiscent of a certain incident in bambi . the film also contains a fair share of violence , including a rather graphic battle between two lions . parents should carefully consider before automatically taking a child of , say , under seven years of age , to this movie . scar , simba's treacherous uncle , is the latest in a long line of disney antagonists . gone is the buffoonery that has marked the recent trio of ursula , gaston , and jafar . the cold-hearted manner in which he causes mufasa's death lets us know that this is not a lion to be trifled with . an all-star cast was selected to supply the lion king's voices . jeremy irons , with his dry british accent , is a critical element of scar's personality . the animation , as expected from any disney film , is superior . as usual , as much attention is given to small background details as to foreground principals . lighting and color are used to highlight the shifting tone of the picture ( the sunny warmth of mufasa's kingdom to the dreary barrenness of scar's ) , and the animators have never lost sight that their subjects are not human . since 1989's the little mermaid , the musical element of any disney animated picture has been nearly as important as the visual one ( the three previous movies have garnered a total of twelve grammy awards ) . for the lion king , menken is absent . two of the five john/rice songs are rather unimpressive ( " i just can't wait to be king " and " hakuna matata " ) , one is decent ( " be prepared " ) , and two are quite good ( " circle of life " and " can you feel the love tonight " ) . " circle of life , " the opening number , is a visual extravaganza that may be the most astounding sequence ever in any animated film . " can you feel the love tonight " is the lion king's love song , although it leaves you wondering if either matthew broderick or moira kelly can sing , since the song vocals of simba and nala are supplied by joseph williams and sally dworsky , respectively . the soundtrack weakness of mermaid , beauty , and aladdin--a dull score--has been rectified in the lion king . with each new animated release , disney seems to be expanding its already-broad horizons a little more . the lion king is the most mature ( in more than one sense ) of these films , and there clearly has been a conscious effort to please adults as much as children . happily , for those of us who generally stay far away from " cartoons , " they have succeeded . 
2	date released : varies running length : 1 : 48 rated : r ( sexual situations , brief nudity , language , mature themes ) it's about the discovery of life , but the real one , i mean : freedom , art , love , sex , friendship . . . all the things that make life interesting . it's an oasis . . . maybe it's too idealistic , but i always thought one of the reasons for cinema was to give pleasure and happiness to the audience . i don't want to make people think about how miserable life is . i prefer to leave that for tomorrow . i like to hear the audience laughing in a dark theater . that's the best music for me . " belle epoque , the winner of nine goyas ( spanish oscars ) , is a charming motion picture that requires only enough thought and concentration to read the subtitles . as a diversion , the film is fabulous . how it managed to win the best foreign language film oscar ( especially over a contender like farewell my concubine ) is another matter altogether . it is 1931 . some of issues presented by the tumultuous political climate and the churning waters of religious uncertainty keep belle epoque from being a completely brainless endeavor . nevertheless , anything serious is kept strictly in the background , and even the most dismal scenes are presented with enough playfulness to avoid betraying the giddy tone . with a minimum of nudity , belle epoque demonstrates that the blatant displays of flesh from something like sirens are unnecessary to set an atmosphere of sensuality . this is a steamy motion picture with its share of bed-hopping and partner-swapping . all six major characters are nicely-developed and well-portrayed . despite the numerous sexual trysts he engages in , fernando is still something of an innocent , and jorge sanz plays him to wide-eyed perfection . the most complex character of all is manolo , who is based on a real-life acquaintance of producer/director fernando trueba . the character's own words describe him best : " i am a rebel , an infidel , and a libertine by nature , living life like a scared old bourgeois . " very little of the humor in belle epoque is especially high-brow--in fact , much of it is quite earthy . more important than the nature of the comedy , however , is that it successfully provokes laughter . as was the intention of fernando trueba when he crafted the film , the ultimate reaction of the audience is to smile . despite the subtitles , this is less art than it is fun . 
2	cast : makiko esumi , takashi naitoh , tadanobu asano director : hirokazu kore-eda producer : naoe gozu screenplay : yoshihisa ogita based on the short story by teru miyamoto cinematography : masao nakabori music : chen ming-chang u . s . distributor : milestone films in an era when mtv-inspired film making techniques have begun to dominate motion pictures , its refreshing to see something with the simple , unhurried style of japanese director hirokazu kore-eda's feature debut , maborosi . kore-eda , along with cinematographer masao nakabori , has meticulously constructed each shot . there are no pans or sweeps , and close-ups are used judiciously . most scenes are photographed from a medium distance , with the action taking place through the lens of a stationary camera . there are frequent shots of empty streets and alleys , and the composition of shadow and light is carefully considered . kore-eda has obviously thought through the visual presentation of every second of maborosi's 110-minute running time . kore-eda has chosen not to illustrate yumiko's emotions through traditionally melodramatic methods . in fact , it's rare that she sheds a tear , although the face of model-turned-actress makiko esumi is certainly capable of expressing a surprising range of feeling . after ikuo's death , the director , much like ingmar bergman , uses spatial relationships to highlight her emotional isolation . she is often distanced from others , frequently appearing alone and shrouded by shadow . towards the end of maborosi , there is a memorable sequence when yumiko , depicted in silhouette , is set far apart from everyone else . kore-eda also uses certain sounds to contribute to the sense of solitude -- the crashing of the waves and the roar of the wind , in particular . there are times when yumiko's icy shield thaws , but such instances are rare . maborosi is a worthwhile movie experience not because it ventures into virgin territory , but because its presentation is so precise and unique . having seen this movie , i can't think of a more effective format than the one chosen by kore-eda . this is a haunting cinematic portrait , where the almost-poetic visual images and their associated emotional meaning hold the viewer enraptured . 
1	welcome to hollywood , where anything can happen . as izzy , the entire movie rests on wahlberg's shoulders , and he can't carry it . last seen as the star of the remake of planet of the apes , he has an incredibly limited emotional range . the script by tv writer john stockwell starts and ends well enough but contains a vast wasteland in-between . director herek's experience directing a bunch of pooches running around or kids skating around doesn't help him fashion a meaningful or exciting film about the world of heavy metal rock legends . the musical concerts are all done by the numbers . one scene , any scene , from almost famous has more life than all of rock star . " now , i'm one of them .

0	screenplay : john byrum . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , brief nudity , adult themes , drug use , violence ) running time : 113 minutes . in the opening scene of duets , director bruce paltrow establishes with little room for doubt that we have fled reality for its hideous cinematic doppleganger . of course the bet proves to be a hustle , but the problem is the casting . not for the voice of god , but for the competent , breathy chops of huey lewis . this isn't the eddie felson of the karaoke set we're talking about ; it's not even the eddie money of the karaoke set . it's huey . freaking . lewis . for the next 108 minutes or so , duets leaps from that implausible scenario to scenarios even less plausible , turning it into a character study in which inhabitants of the planet earth are nowhere to be found . essentially it's a road picture , switching back and forth between three less-than-dynamic duos converging on a big karaoke contest in omaha . duets is one of those " when bad movies happen to good actors " experiences that makes you wonder whether anyone involved actually read the script before committing . it's particularly sad watching giamatti and braugher do the buddy bonding thing with such shallow characters . giamatti makes for such a wonderfully manic schlub that he's entertaining to watch in spite of the material ; braugher has presence , but he can't bring any depth to a character that's ultimately supposed to be tragic . paltrow does a nice ditzy bit , but that's the one note her character is allowed . in fact , that's true of every character in the film . bello , speedman , lewis and company are all playing characters with one note , one epiphany and one grinning resolution . these aren't performances ; they're cries for help . paltrow the elder offers none , and goes one better by actually making matters worse . a talented television director with little feature film experience , paltrow puts his film together in such a disjointed manner that even well-constructed characters would have been hard-pressed to emerge intact . close-ups become medium shots for a couple of seconds for no apparent reason before returning to close-ups ; ostensibly comic scenes linger and dawdle with no punch . paltrow does have the paternal generosity and good sense to let the gifted cinematographer paul sarossy shoot gwyneth lovingly . there's no pacing , no momentum and no point . there is , however , plenty of karaoke . duets seems constructed with the desperate hope that viewers will be entertained enough by the musical numbers -- lifted heavily from the pop music glory years of the late '70s and early '80s -- that they'll ignore the complete absence of personality in anyone singing them . unfortunately , that's fairly typical of the skewed world served up in duets . if you loved huey as the pride of every karaoke joint , you'll love the police leaving an armed man alone for a final tender moment . in this paper-thin road film , reality is the road not taken . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
2	starring : isabelle adjani , daniel auteuil , jean-hugues anglade , vincent perez , virna lisi , pascal greggory , julien rassam , dominique blanc director : patrice chereau producer : claude berri screenplay : daniele thompson and patrice chereau based on the novel by alexandre dumas cinematography : philippe rousselot music : goran bregovi released by miramax films in french with subtitles the ageless isabelle adjani , one of france's most beautiful faces , has an undeniable screen presence . not only is there no chemistry between these two , but the cold- as-ice adjani never thaws , and perez shows that in france , like elsewhere , physical attractiveness does not equate to acting talent . fortunately , there's a lot more going on in queen margot than the relationship between perez' gallant la mole and adjani's title character . the film's primary focus is the bloody sixteenth-century struggle between french catholics and protestants , and the resulting political intrigue in the court of king charles xi . margot makes it clear that henri is not welcome in her bed . yet the i claudius-like scheming and political machinations have just begun . most of queen margot is a top-notch historical epic featuring impeccable costumes and grand scenery . unlike the " typical " french film , this is not at all talky . in fact , amidst the swordfights , carnage , and battle scenes , there are occasions when dialogue is at a premium . queen margot is a sumptuous movie--except when the focus switches to the poorly realized romance between margot and la mole . perhaps the most chilling sequence in queen margot depicts the dumping of hundreds of lifeless bodies into mass graves . echoing holocaust horrors , it's not a unique cinematic picture , but this type of scene is rarely associated with anything other than nazi concentration camps . it serves as an unpleasant reminder that atrocities litter the entire spectrum of human history , not just the present and recent past . directed by patrice chereau and produced by claude berri ( the director of such epics as jean de florette/manon of the spring and germinal ) , queen margot never becomes tiresome despite a substantial running length ( actually , more than 30 minutes were trimmed by miramax from the original cut ) . there is enough energy to drive this film through its few slow spots on momentum alone , and chereau fortunately doesn't subject us to too many scenes with only adjani and perez . queen margot has enough pomp and pageantry--not to mention melodrama--to alienate viewers who don't enjoy that sort of film . however , for those who appreciate bigger-than-life historical sagas , chereau's entry is often impressive and almost always entertaining . 
2	innocence is a rarely told tale of seniors in love that is written and directed with a graceful delicateness by paul cox . starring three veteran australian actors , julia blake ( my brilliant career ) , charles 'bud' tingwell ( the dish ) and terry norris , the film is superbly and touchingly acted . although they may be in their waning years , the movie's seventyish characters demonstrate a palpable zest for the essence of life and love . the sometimes surprising story is wonderfully moving without being overly sentimental and completely honest while avoiding cheap theatrics . utterly in love , they stop to kiss and caress . in a film that has so much is right about it that it's hard to list everything , it should be pointed out that the casting of these two is quite perfect . besides spouses , claire and andreas have children and grandchildren . you may well wonder what an affair among seniors is like . certainly , the cinema gives us little guidance as to what we should expect . affairs in movies rarely occur with anyone older than middle age . his initial reaction isn't what you'd expect . since the story focuses on the love that claire and andreas have for each other , it would be easy to have john be either unimportant or some kind of clich ? . instead , terry norris infuses his character with a mixture of hopelessness , confusion and resoluteness .

1	message in a bottle ( warner bros . ) starring : kevin costner , robin wright penn , paul newman , illeana douglas . producers : denise di novi , jim wilson and kevin costner . director : luis mandoki . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , sexual situations , profanity ) running time : 135 minutes . you can imagine newman both as a man's man -- a loner dedicated to his craft -- and a ladies' man -- deeply sensitive when touched by the love of a good woman . that's the kind of screen presence you need when you're dealing with one of these mythically appealing romances like the bridges of madison county or the horse whisperer . you need a clint eastwood , or a robert redford . . . or a paul newman . costner . yet here he is in message in a bottle , playing the emotionally unavailable but romantically irresistable garret . he's the kind of guy who loves too deeply , whose gestures of self-sacrifice are the stuff of song and story . it's costner once again as the paradigm , the icon , and i for one didn't believe him for a second . to be fair , costner isn't the only thing wrong with message in a bottle . director luis mandoki's adaptation is a technically glorious piece of work -- beautifully photographed by caleb deschanel , sweepingly scored by gabriel yared -- but it's one heck of a long sit , clocking in at a soggy two hours and fifteen minutes . the storyline parallels theresa's emergence from emotional isolation after a difficult divorce with garret's difficulties letting go of his wife , and does so in fetishistic detail . there's a subplot involving garret's conflict with his embittered in-laws , and the occasional tete-a-tete between dodge and garret or between dodge and theresa , all building with a gruelling lack of tension to one big cathartic payoff . you may leave the theater with your hanky wet , but it could be from the drool that collects while you nod off to sleep just as easily as from tears . lost at sea along the way are extremely effective performances by robin wright penn and paul newman . wright penn is an actress we don't see very much , which allows her still to be an actress in a role like this rather than a movie star . her conflicted pursuit of garret -- a man whose letters should have told her from the start isn't ready to love anyone else -- is convincing in context ; her moments of insecurity and disappointment are genuinely affecting . newman , meanwhile , gets to be gruff in a way that usually turns actors into hams , but turns this veteran into a breath of fresh air . he's so effortlessly charming , it's easy to forget the harlequin sensibility at the heart of message in a bottle and begin enjoying it as human relationship drama . costner , too , can be effortlessly charming , but not here . his interpretation of the role is so focused on garret's internalized mourning that in the moments when he's supposed to be letting go with theresa , he looks like a man trying to act like a grieving man trying to be effortlessly charming . message in a bottle undoubtedly will have its sob appeal , just as the novel did . unlike the film adaptations of the bridges of madison county and the horse whisperer , that's the main thing this one has going for it . it's too bad it couldn't have been made twenty-five years ago , when paul newman hadn't yet handed over the iconic roles to actors ill-suited to handling them . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	cast : saskia reeves , robert reynolds , sami frey , jacqueline mckenzie , kiet lam director : pauline chan producer : jim mcelroy screenplay : robert carter and pauline chan based on characters from dreamhouse by kate grenville cinematography : kevin hayward music : douglas stephen rae u . s . distributor : filmopolis pictures this fascinating study of how global events impact on the individual is marred only by occasionally obvious plotting and subpar performances . michael has come here to research and author a study of the overseas successes of the french indochine rubber company . each of the characters has a clearly-defined arc . no matter how apparent the inevitable result becomes , he will not see it . like one of shakespeare's tragically flawed characters , he stands his ground to the end . however , hers is the least developed part , since the character is used primarily as a catalyst for louise's transformation . both the political and the personal aspects of traps are compelling , although there are times when the plot follows a too- predictable path . unfortunately , the acting lets the screenplay down . the best of the four leads is saskia reeves , and she's no better than mediocre . sami frey , who gave an impressively intense performance in my life and times with antonin artaud , doesn't do much to breathe life into his character . robert reynolds is flat , and jacqueline mckenzie has the opposite problem , often going over-the-top . there are numerous scenes where these actors can't convey the full impact of a situation , so it's left to the viewer to interpolate . considering the universal appeal of these themes , it's not surprising that they have shown up again . more significantly , however , there's resonance in traps for any viewer--that who we think we are , or pretend to be , often bears little resemblance to our true personality . 
1	if you like nonsense musicals with plenty of singing , beautiful set designs , fantastic colors , sex , witchcraft , and a fairy tale charm to it , then you will probably like this film , which is in many ways like flying down to rio . though , i was hoping it could be more like those jacques demy or jacques rivette musicals , exhibiting a little more substance . but if you are in a mood for some light entertainment , this zany musical has plenty of oomph and should satisfy your latino appetite for something that is easy and sexy to look at . the little known director of this film , hails from venezuela , which gives this french film a very natural latin twist to its story and music . the this is all done as harmless and silly fun , much in the vein of a long list of hollywood and french musicals , films that i was never partial to . for what it's worth , this film is an entertaining and colorful spectacle , and with enough verve in it to make it seem inventive . 
0	fingers scraping across a blackboard . hanging up , one of the most irritating movies of the year , features non-stop phoning . like fingers grating across a blackboard , these cell and cordless phones ring incessantly . and , when the phones go on strike briefly during flashbacks , the story manages to be no less obnoxious . populated by clich ? d , unbearable characters , with whom you wouldn't want to spend 5 minutes , much less 90+ , the film is about as much fun as answering calls from telemarketers while you're trying , unsuccessfully , to have dinner . essentially a very long infomercial for the joys and trendiness of cell phoning , the movie gets in your face like a drunk at a cocktail party . the film's director , diane keaton , proves again than she's a much better actress than a director . call me every 5 minutes . " eve's son , jessie ( jesse james ) , has just discovered an especially insufferable laugh that almost rivals the movie's ubiquitous ringing sounds in detestability . to round out this strong but misused cast , cloris leachman plays pat , lou's ex-wife . the story by delia ephron does have a few nice moments -- perhaps the best being when eve , wearing one of her signature see-through blouses , wakes to the sound of a doorbell . it is rated pg-13 for language and some sex-related material and would be acceptable for kids 12 and up . 
2	director : jerry zaks . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( some strong profanity , mature themes ) . running time : 97 minutes . please ignore the next couple of sentences if you are a stickler about having no part of a plot spoiled for you : in marvin's room , nobody dies . illness plays a significant role in the story , and many viewers have come to resent maudlin disease-of-the-week melodramas in which everything seems to function as an extended prologue to a tear-jerking deathbed scene . there is something terribly dehumanizing about making an illness the central character in a narrative , so it is a relief to discover that marvin's room is actually about people . though occasionally stage-bound and over-plotted , marvin's room finds superb actors lending a surprisingly restrained touch to a genre crying out for a little restraint . fortunately , marvin's room isn't _about_ aids any more than it is _about_ any disease . it is about estrangement and reconciliation and family ties , and it covers this treacherous ground with as much comedy as sadness . stage veteran jerry zaks does fine work with his rookie screen effort , and the gifted cinematographer piotr sobocinski ( krzysztof kieslowski's red ) gives marvin's room a warm , comforting glow . the overall effect of the film is an unusual one for films of its kind : it draws you in without pouncing on you with over-wrought emotions . the superb cast certainly deserves much of the credit for that success . and of course there is meryl streep , an actress so talented it has become a sort of cinematic sport to mock her versatility . here she plays lee with an anger which drives her every action ( though she does indulge in that well-work actor's crutch of acting with her cigarette on occasion ) , and she is convincing both in her early resistance to any overtures of good will and in her slow realization that she cares more about her sister than she realized . there is a particular grace to her honest portrayal of someone terribly uncomfortable with being around illness . there are certainly times when marvin's room feels hemmed in by its stage roots , and conversations build to an over-dramatized pitch . mcpherson's script also over plays its comic relief card , particularly in the person of dan hedaya as a lithium-medicated receptionist who seems more appropriate to an episode of " murphy brown . " dicaprio's character also feels out of place occasionally , as though every time the story turned back to him it was in danger of losing its way . but the important factor in marvin's room is that these people don't get together for the express purpose of watching one of them die . living is more interesting -- and more complicated -- than dying , and mcpherson created a work which recognizes that fact . you don't have to have a funeral to touch real emotions . 
2	if you're looking for a textbook example of counter-programming , you would have to say that mgm's release of moll flanders qualifies . . . either that , or a textbook example of complete stupidity . june is supposed to be the exclusive domain of sequels , special effects and super-stars ; films based on period novels are not supposed to appear until the kids are back in school , the leaves have changed colors and the air is heady with oscar talk . nevertheless , here we have a romance with english accents taking on cruise , connery and carrey . it's a risky move , but one which could pay off , because moll flanders is a solid drama with a top-notch cast , and gives robin wright a break-out role to show off her talents . pen densham oversees a marvelous look for the production of moll flanders , and that look helps to make a fitful first half easier to take . the greatest charms in that first half are provided by freeman and corcoran , who share some frisky scenes as the no-nonsense manservant and his mischievous charge ; those scenes provide welcome comic relief . making your way through moll flanders can be like the experience of reading the novel in a high school english class -- the early exposition can lose you before you get to the meat of the story . i would hope that such is not the case , because moll flanders becomes an extremely effective and satisfying love story , and because even in that sluggish first hour robin wright turns in a wonderful performance . despite her delicate features , wright can make herself appear amazingly solid and determined , and that is a critical facet of the personality she is trying to convey . there is a completely natural chemistry between them , and their relationship makes the second half of moll flanders something special . densham's erratic sense of pacing does undercut the love story somewhat , as moll flanders never quite achieves the big , cathartic emotional moments one expects from a story of this kind . i think that he also doesn't allow freeman or stockard channing to do the best work of which they are capable . freeman may be the best american screen actor of the moment , but he never quite finds the character of the emotionally enslaved hibble , and channing similarly wavers between a kind of one-dimensional victorian villainy and a kinder , gentler side . what really makes moll flanders work , in a way that the recent jane eyre didn't , is that densham maintains a fundamental sense of optimism and energy , relegating the sense of loss and foreboding which could have dominated the story to a secondary status . moll flanders is a redemption story , and it is an effective one . it is also a human story , and that alone may help it to stand out while every theater around it reverberates with tornadoes and explosions . 
0	mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 101 minutes . i'll give this to paul thomas anderson : he's got a sense of atmosphere . hard eight , anderson's feature writing and directing debut , may be even more successful than leaving las vegas at making casinos look ugly , and his characters exchange dialogue as though every word had to be yanked out of them with pliers . that's the good news . the bad news is that hard eight is yet another frustrating independent film by a rookie film-maker who has an idea of what his film should be _like_ without having an idea of what it should be _about_ . though generally well-acted and interesting to look at , hard eight is more a collection of thematic ideas than a story . an extended sequence during the first half hour of hard eight might lead you to believe that the film is going to be a revelatory study of the gambling culture . it is an interesting lesson in deception -- as is a later instruction on how to steal pay-per-view movies which could send hotels all across america scrambling to cover themselves -- which gives hard eight a welcome sense of authenticity . that sociological curiosity factor isn't enough to sustain a film , though , and sooner or later anderson has to get down to the business of examining the relationships between these characters . at least he should have , but he never does . we see far too little of sidney and john together to get a sense of their friendship , making the significant revelations to come ring totally false . we get a chance to see him in a variety of situations -- playing the big shot at a craps table , cleaning up after john's messes , showing kindness to waitress/hooker clementine ( a thanklessly unpleasant role for paltrow ) -- without really giving us a sense of who he is , as though anderson thinks teasing us with a dark past is sufficient . it's not . every once in a while , hard eight breaks out of its languid stupor long enough for some gratuitous violence , a half-hearted attempt at fooling the audience into thinking something is happening . every time , it doesn't take long for the film to settle back into a bleak somnambulism . jackson's profanity-laced tirades are entertaining to a point , but it soon becomes clear that he's merely recycling riffs from pulp fiction's jules because there isn't anything here on which he can base a unique character . he's not really a character at all here ; he's a plot device , someone who turns up when it's necessary for something to happen . a number of things happen in hard eight , but none of it adds up to a narrative we should care about . hard eight is evocative but thoroughly unsatisfying , a film in which an oppressive atmosphere of foreboding is the real central character , crushing the human characters like empty beer cans . 
1	the director is ultimately asking the viewer to be the judge , as he seems too preoccupied with painting his canvas with a love that gets stuck somewhere between a lustful sexual romp and one of pathos . what results in an incomplete ending for a film that can't stand clarity except in its photography and its affection for the three flawed main characters ( alice , martin , and benjamin ) . the story seemed jarring at times , its inexorable rhythms and its lack of dialogue seemed out of place with the attempt made in tracking each character down in depth . yet the film seems to work best when it was in a state of murkiness . when things started clearing up and the characters become who we think they were , the big secret doesn't seem that surprising , but how it is handled seems bizarre though not fully credible , as it is perplexing why the main character is so concerned with finding out something about himself that will cause him so much pain when he doesn't have to . yet there is something about this film that is more than meets the eye , even though the film left me unsatisfied , it was still so well-crafted , that i found myself liking it better than i first thought i did . the film does not necessarily go in chronological order , thereby the flashbacks that come without order , are meant to give weight to the story as presented at the time , and will give this rather conventional unhappy family story line a feeling of much more mystery than is needed . but it's too melodramatic , the guilt motivation seems too illogical , and the half-baked psychology fails to explain its characters for it too fully work as drama . the actors were all sweating their lines to make it seem as if they had to dig deep to come up with a gem here and there , but their performances were all finely tuned and seemed to add to the film's need to have confusion be its guiding light . what keeps this film going , is the way it keeps the emotional pot boiling , and just when you are ready to give up on it as merely sitcom stuff , the film bounces back from its wordless silence and halting love dramatics to boil over with fits of liberating agony . there was no dialogue to explain why he's a fugitive or what's on his mind . she turns down this proposal , but with a look more of sadness than of love , she goes to him and says , " take me , i'm yours if you want me . " you have to stick with this one and not get too perturbed by the unsatisfying finale to see this one through and then , you might feel its emotional grip growing on you . it's a pure cinematic vehicle , where the pictures tell the story better than the story seems to be told . there was a strangely felt wry humor that underscored the dead serious mood the film had . alexis loret , in his debut film role , gives an interesting performance of someone who is always out of place no matter where he is . but , when it comes to the heavy romance , i didn't feel that this romance was as deep as portrayed . though the director might have implied it had more going for it than sexual gratification , i saw no other convincing reason for the romance . it could be asserted that maternal instincts , soul searching , and misplaced pathos on juliette's part were responsible for the romance , but i couldn't see any other reason but the libido . martin was just not a warm enough character to believe he could generate so much unconditional love . 
1	in silvio soldini's sometimes cute but excessively long comedy bread and tulips ( pane e tulipani ) , the story starts in an italian tour bus . this would-be gumshoe , who looks like john candy playing colombo , always wears a rumpled trench coat , a bright , mustard colored shirt , a frumpy hat and clip-on sunshades . he sneaks around the venetian alleyways like a pudgy pink panther . these visuals of the awkward detective provide most of the story's limited humor . a big hit in its native italy , bread and tulips generates few laughs on this side of the atlantic . i found it rather comparable to a typical television sitcom , which isn't exactly a glowing recommendation . bread and tulips runs a long 1 : 52 . the film is in italian with english subtitles . it is rated pg-13 for " brief language , some sensuality and drug references " and would be acceptable for kids around 8 and up . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
2	now with a cast this talented and material this strong , rehashing is not necessarily bad . the character creations in all the star wars series are delightfully imaginative . jabba and his minions are testaments to the grotesque and the obese . after being grossed out by jabba's huge rolls of jelly like fat , i suspect a large number of people must have run out of the theater to hit the pay phones to call 1-800-outfat or some such number . a better advertisement for fat clinics i have not seen . by the way , i thought one of jabba's entourage was at least a kissing cousin to the gargoyles that populate the movie gremlins . one thing remains . one things remains , vader . i love the flowery language the writers ( lawrence kasdan and george lucas ) give yoda . he appears in a vision telling luke , " you will find that many of the truths we cling to depend upon your point of view . " this is a show of secrets revealed , but you will not find them out here . see the movie . that they could control the bikes while traveling at the high speed they are going makes no sense , but hey , this is science fiction afterall . they were a hit at the time , but i am surprised there wasn't at even a bigger marketing tie in with them . looked like great toys for the age 2-9 set to me . the acting in the movie was good . hamill , whom i found to be a big disappointment in the last episode , has more energy and does his part less on autopilot in this one . his performance here still pales in significance to his work in star wars , which is the only film he has ever been great in . although the show was excellent , there were several letdowns for me . first and foremost , i missed the incredible humor from the first two . there are laughs in return of the jedi , but overall the writers and the director ( richard marquand ) approach the show too reverentially . second , i missed the romantic angle . there was some aspects of it in this episode , but not much . the film is correctly rated pg and the scariest part is the monsters which i suspect will be more than most kids under 5 or 6 can handle . there is no sex , nudity or profanity i can remember , but the star wars groupies will undoubtedly send me one or two minor cuss words i missed . most of them pointed out after my review of the empire strikes back that mark hamill had been in a car accident with some sure that it was before the movie and others equally sure it was after . since my favorite was star wars , i asked jeffrey which one of the three he liked best , and he said this one , but would refused to say why . not a reason i would have guessed ! i give the movie * * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	can one have too good of a friend ? and what does it take to remove a 20-year writer's block , especially if the writer isn't aware that he has it in the first place ? it's a frustratingly familiar scene to which most parents can easily relate . michel has no idea who this man with the frozen , silly grin on his face is . harry is such an enormous admirer of michel's work that he can recite michel's poem by heart , which surprises claire who didn't know that michel ever wrote anything . the ever-perturbed but resilient michel has more problems than growing girls . always butting in where they're not wanted , their most recent and unappreciated gift is a new , bright pink -- they insist it's fuchsia -- bathroom in the country farmhouse that michel has been working on restoring every summer . the story's dark second half , full of morbid humor , concerns harry's unsolicited help with every aspect of michel's life . only the story's predictability and the plot's long setup detract from its enjoyment . the wickedly funny film leaves you with lots to talk about when you leave . the film is in french with english subtitles . it is rated r for language , some violence and a scene of nudity and would be acceptable for most teenagers . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
2	the merchant ivory film a soldier's daughter never cries is a richly textured series of sketches pasted into an inviting , cinematic picture book . based on kaylie jones's novel of an expatriate family living in paris in the 1960s and 1970s , the story starts slowly as it introduces its characters , but it eventually weaves a strong spell on the audience . he voices controversial opinions that sometimes make sense and other times don't . except for these relatively weak characters , the movie is fully fleshed out . both actresses deliver wonderfully complex and winning performances . the realistic portrayal of channe's life and loves has incidents and characters just quirky enough to mimic real life without being too outlandish . the script by james ivory and ruth prawer jhabvala has the good sense to avoid the obvious scenes . instead , the script leads us into a heart-warming christmas tree trimming scene . the most original and intriguing character in the movie is the teenage channe's best friend , francis fortescue . francis , played by real-life operatic singer anthony roth costanzo in his first acting role , isn't channe's boyfriend per se , even if he'd like to be . his passion is opera , and his high-pitched voice is phenomenal . teenagers should all have such a wonderful friend as francis . having made us feel like part of the family , we become deeply but subtly moved by this last third of the picture . since they are viewed as weird , they act the part . the story , which gets to you in ways that are hard to explain , reminds us of the fragility of life and of the need to take the time to be with our loved ones , while they're still with us . and it teaches us about the need for friendships , both romantic and platonic . the first part of the film is partially in french with english subtitles . it is rated r for a little profanity and for mature situations and would be fine for teenagers . 
2	while on vacation we decided to check out some of the disney movies that we missed at the theaters . the top on our list was the 1992 picture aladdin , disney's loose retelling of the story of aladdin and his magic lamp . in a movie filled with academy award winning music ( alan menken ) but mediocre songs ( alan menken , howard ashman , tim rice ) , a couple of the most forgettable songs occur in the beginning . the film has two distinct parts -- let's call them bg and ag -- before the genie , played with tremendous comedic gusto by robin williams , appears and after . ( the rich always have it rough in the movies . ) aladdin ends up with the magic lamp and accidentally summons the genie ( voice by -- drum roll -- robin williams ) . after half an hour , bg is finally over , and we enter the dramatically more interesting ag period . during ag , the show bursts with all of the energy it lacked in bg . williams does his shtick as only he can . the disney animators follow along creating images of equal intensity to his routine , right down to a neon sign that says " applause " at the end of one of his numbers . one could make a cogent argument that this vaudeville routine has no place in a story about aladdin , but who cares , it is extremely funny . and the first rule of a comedy , especially a cartoon , is that , if it is funny , go with it and don't worry too much about logic . williams , for the many adults in the audience , even includes some fun impersonations of other actors like jack nicholson . again , it doesn't make any sense , but it's funny . disney animators show off their talents in many ways . the regal movie uses a palette of colors worthy of the arabian nights . watch especially how well the animators can imbue human life and motion into animals and normally inanimate objects . the magic carpet is a perfect example . they give a real personality to what otherwise looks like just a high quality throw rug . almost as a byproduct , the story teaches some nice moral lessons , but the script by ron clements , ted elliott , john musker , and terry rossio puts all of its creativity into the humor . the result is a satisfying film that will keep the whole family laughing . it is rated g and would be fine for all ages with the possible exception of a brief snake scene . my son jeffrey , age 8 , thought the show was " very good , " but when pressed for a comparison with one of his favorite disney films , the lion king , he said he liked the lion king better , and i agree . i recommend aladdin to you and give it * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : june 29 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	he replaced the deceased warner oland , and plays chan in a more avuncular style . this film comes at the onset of ww 11 and therefore has a patriotic theme , which is well-crafted into the sabotage story so as not to seem misplaced storytelling . " one enemy is one too many . " the best part of this enjoyable whodunit , was that it was hard to guess who ryner was . 
1	ready for the first completely real-time movie since rope ? the screenwriters tell you this and then director john badham carefully choreographs the actors so that the movie itself takes exactly one hour and thirty minutes to get there . the plot is fairly simple . one of the best minor characters is that of a hotel shoe shiner named huey and played by charles dutton . i will not reveal any more details of the movie since working your way through the maze of the plot in real-time is something you should experience yourself . suffice it to say that it is wrapped up nicely although you think it is such a conundrum that there is no reasonable way to end it . moreover , it even has a neat and brief epilogue with one of the key minor characters . here he is low key but quite effective . i was disappointed by christopher walken . usually he dominates any scene he is in with his explosive or potentially explosive behavior . here the director had him under too tight a leash . peter strauss never even attempts acting in the movie . his role could have added to the tension , but strauss's lack of energy only serves to dampen it . my favorite actor in the movie was marsha mason . she was totally believable and brought a lot to a small but crucial role . the script is fun , and the real-time aspects work . the dialog is nothing special however , and most of the characters should have been better written . the cinematography is outstanding on many levels in the way it conveys the hopelessness and the confusion of the main character . in other scenes extreme wide angles are used to show how distorted the world feels to him . nick of time runs , and i do mean runs , a little over an hour and a half . it is rated r for some bad language and some shot 'em up violence , but without much blood . there is no sex or nudity . i think it is a soft r , and i would have no problems with teenagers going . one family in our theater brought in their 3 and 8 year olds , which was just plain stupid - it is not pg-13 material . i recommend the movie to you and give it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	but with it's thin narrative , based on mitchell's off broadway play , the story doesn't have much to offer save its one , recurring visual joke of hedwig belting out songs in nondescript salad bars and coffee shops , whose patrons don't know what to make of hedwig and his band . few are impressed , and most just stare , which was about my reaction to the movie . to be fair , comedy is a very personal medium , and the stranger on my left laughed constantly . these drawings left me as cold as the rest of the movie . perhaps if i had liked the music , which i didn't , i could have enjoyed the film . as it is , all i can say is that mitchell does throw his heart and soul into the production . i just wish that the result had more to offer than a promising beginning . it is rated r for sexual content and language and would be acceptable for older teenagers . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
2	the rugrats are back in a movie , rugrats in paris : the movie , that is sweeter and funnier than their first . offering as much for the adults as the kids , the film opens with the classic wedding scene from the godfather , complete with nino rota's music . in a darkened room , one of the rugrats , asking a favor of the " bobfather , " starts off with " i believe in the playground . . . " the surprise is that this scene plays as smartly funny for the kids in the audience as the adults . my son mentioned it as one of his favorite parts . don't worry , the movie is correctly rated g . the head came off of a rocking horse . this scene , however , is one that undoubtedly will appeal mainly to the adults . the rugrats , as always , get much of their humor from their rampant malapropisms . the paris setting gives the animators a chance to show off their colorful talents to maximum effect . the result is a bright and cheerful movie that is a delight to watch . the foreign locale also provides many opportunities for humor . as the kids play with the first bidet that they have ever seen , one ecstatically proclaims , " wow , a potty that squirts you back ! " my favorite line comes when the adults are in church . " wake me if you see a hunchback . " why a gigantic , bright blue snail , of course . the really gutsy move is that by nickelodeon . and they'll need lots of garlic . it is rated g and would be fine for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 11 , loves rugrats and their latest movie , giving it * * * * . he also mentioned the music among several other parts that he really liked . his friend maxim , age 12 , gave it * * * , saying it was a good movie but had only an okay plot . 
2	new zealand , 1995 u . s . release date : not known running length : 0 : 52 mpaa classification : no mpaa rating ( mature themes , brief nudity ) theatrical aspect ratio : 1 . 85 : 1 shown at the philadelphia festival of world cinema , 5/6/97 & 5/9/97 with some " mockumentaries " ( or " meta-documentaries " , " pseudo- documentaries " , or whatever else you want to call them ) , it's best not to know beforehand that they're fakes . with this film , if you don't know in advance that it isn't a real documentary , you'll almost certainly be bamboozled , and , in the process , miss some of the most subtle humor . taken at face value , forgotten silver is mildly entertaining , but , for those who recognize its true nature , it's nothing short of brilliant . jeffrey thomas , a man with an appropriately stentorian voice , does the narration for forgotten silver , which is presented as a straightforward documentary about an all-but-forgotten , turn-of-the- century new zealand film maker . his achievements included inventing the first mechanized camera , making the first full-length feature film with sound ( in 1908 -- it was a failure because all of the actors spoke chinese and he didn't have the foresight to invent subtitles ) , experimenting with color ( in 1911 -- he was arrested on smut charges because a topless woman appeared in the test film ) , and introducing the closeup . movie critic/historian leonard maltin gushes about the scope and quality of mckenzie's work . actor sam neill comments about the importance of the mckenzie revelations to the new zealand film industry . using subtle special effects to re-create old , damaged footage , forgotten silver makes it easy to believe that we're seeing celluloid that has been stored in a shed for fifty years . not only are we treated to glimpses of mckenzie's pioneering efforts in cinema , but we're shown significant chunks of salome , a credible-looking silent presentation of the biblical tale about the dancing girl who demanded john the baptist's head . while the film makers have crafted forgotten silver as a first- rate parody , it's clear that both men possess a great deal of affection for and knowledge about the early history of cinema . this is the sort of project one might expect from peter jackson , the inventive director whose previous outings have included the brilliant heavenly creatures , the outrageously sick meet the feebles , and the big-budget , offbeat comedy , the frighteners . along with co- director costa botes , jackson has put together one of the most interesting fake documentaries to come along since the genre was first popularized with this is spinal tap . the more you love film and understand film history , the more you'll get out of this picture , but even the most oblivious movie-goers will find forgotten silver's mixture of fact and fiction enjoyable . when this movie was shown on new zealand tv , it's impact was akin to that of orson welles' legendary halloween radio broadcast of war of the worlds . this simple fact shouldn't be taken as an indication of new zealanders' gullibility , but of the effectiveness of forgotten silver . watch it carefully , and you'll be amused , amazed , and entertained . 
2	caught is a powerful character study and devastating love triangle . although the title of the picture is an obvious giveaway for the ending , it doesn't matter . this is no mystery ; the revelations are of the spirit and not of some artificial turn of an overly clever suspense plot . but he puts it more succinctly , " fish been very , very good to me . " get up at 5 : 00am , i'll take you to fulton's fish market . " yes , this is a show that strains credulity every now and then , but the emotions are real and the scenes so natural you will have no problem suspending disbelief . the unglamorous cinematography by michael f . barrow is as carefully constructed and important as the antonymic lush work of john toll in legends of the fall . these people look more like inhabitants of a documentary than a fictional romance . barrow loves close-ups and editor norman buckley combines them into dizzyingly fast sequences that keeps the pacing and the energy high . schub has this evil look that makes his every statement seem to have deep hidden portent . all of the performances are quite good , but maria conchita alonso owns every scene she is in . the ending is much more impressive and complicated that the straightforward title suggestions . it is the best part of the film , and i liked it all except the way the conflict between nick and danny is resolved . masterfully directed by robert m . young ( dominick and eugene and triumph of the spirit ) and with a well developed screenplay by edward pomerantz ( based on his book " into it " ) , caught is an entrancing film with sympathetic characters that keeps you glued to the screen . the script saves the best for last without ever cheating the audience along the way . sometimes devastating , periodically erotic , always smartly written and acted , and frequently tender , caught is a cornucopia of emotions . if you go , it will catch you in its spell . it is rated r for one dope smoking scene , lots of sex of many varieties , nudity , some violence , and bad language . it would be okay for mature teenagers only . for adults , i recommend it and give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	starring : rade serbedzija , katrin cartlidge , gregoire colin director : milcho manchevski screenplay : milcho manchevski cinematography : manuel teran music : " anastasia " released by gramercy pictures in macedonian , english , and albanian with subtitles as well as being a repeated line in before the rain , this statement clarifies director milcho manchevski's perspective . the structure of the movie is non-chronological with the conclusion actually occurring about forty minutes into the film . manchevski , directing his first major feature following a string of music videos , presents his message with a sublime intensity that eludes the film world's oliver stones . before the rain isn't explicitly about bosnia , but it goes a long way towards explaining the " whys " of what's happening there . the film is as rich in symbols as in narrative . circles are everywhere , and water takes on its age-old meaning of purification . if there's one weakness in before the rain , it's that despite an ambitious story , beautiful cinematography , convincing acting , and a powerful message , character development is surprisingly feeble . part of the problem is undoubtedly the odd structure of the plot , but even aleksandar , who has more screen time than anyone else , seems a little hollow . there are instances when he's more the mouthpiece of a philosophy than a unique individual . this is indicative of before the rain's most apparent flaw : that manchevski occasionally lets the " art " of his production obscure its emotional impact . the visceral effectiveness of before the rain is undeniable--it brings home the global reality of violence without ever glorifying or glamorizing it . the film is loaded with chilling little touches of how this particular circle has trapped humanity . as " words " reminds us , communications problems are often more fundamental than language differences . in manchevski's world , when peace exists , it's an exception , and redemption is perhaps a futile gesture . 
2	for better or for worse , most gay-themed motion pictures have a political ax to grind . and , while that might appeal to those who enjoy movies that espouse a cause , it doesn't always make for the most entertaining time in a theater . in may ways , therefore , hettie macdonald's feature debut , beautiful thing , is a breath of fresh air . instead of politicizing the issue of two adolescent boys' homosexuality , it keeps the story intimate , and , even on those occasions when the tale strays into over-familiar dramatic territory , beautiful thing remains steadfastly faithful to the characters it has created . however , each of them is apprehensive not only about acting upon it , but about even admitting it . the relationship between jamie and ste comes across as surprisingly heartfelt yet unsentimental . there's all the angst and uncertainty one would expect from boys struggling with a foreign sexual identity , recognizing that if they choose what comes naturally , they will face society's contempt . macdonald , with more than a little help from two skilled young actors , glen berry and scott neal , manages to capture the nuances of the situation , exploring the emotional complexity of the circumstances without resorting to melodrama . unfortunately , beautiful thing has a plethora of subplots , none of which comes close to the main story in terms of richness or sensitivity . a neighborhood girl , leah ( tameka empson ) , initially looks like she might play an important part in the film , but she ends up in a supporting role , offering occasional comic relief and providing much of the soundtrack as a result of her obsession with mama cass ( of the mamas and papas ) . despite having the potential to be beautiful thing's most interesting character , she remains severely underdeveloped and underused . the acting , as we have come to expect from british films , is solid from top to bottom . berry and neal effectively convey their characters' situation to the audience , allowing us to share in the complicated web of wonder and pain that they experience as they come to terms with their identity . tameka empson is delightful as the off-the-wall druggie leah . beautiful thing uses numerous conventions of urban dramas and forbidden love stories in its framework , but , because macdonald keeps the focus intimately on jamie and ste , the result is still satisfying . only the ending , which gives a false sense of closure to an otherwise well-balanced narrative , feels wrong . otherwise , beautiful thing represents a keen , personal look at the difficulties of growing up gay in a heterosexual world . 
1	long-time readers of this space will recall that i have never promoted the myth of critical objectivity . i am merely a man , folks , a flesh-and-blood film fan with preferences and pet peeves just like everyone else . brilliant special effects will never move me like a brilliant script will . i'm indifferent about baseball , but i love baseball movies . " heartwarming comedies " leave me cold . i'm too easy on woody allen sometimes . and so on . the matchmaker appears to have been made with a direct network connection to my cinematic soft spots . now you're just not playing fair . their combined charm is irresistable , flimsy though the story may be . on a number of levels , it's clear that the matchmaker needs a bit more fleshing out . her relationship with sean ( nicely played by david o'hara as a fiery idealist ) is better developed than you find in most romantic comedies , but we never understand why it might be truly important to marcy . it's all very pleasant , in an inconsequential sort of way . then again , if you add up all the things about the matchmaker which are very pleasant , you have a fairly pleasant film experience . first there is garofolo herself , a screen presence unlike any other in film . acerbic , smart and unconventionally beautiful , garofolo improves a story by her mere presence . she doesn't have as strong a character to latch on to as she had in the truth about cats & dogs , but she's still an energetic presence who's easy to root for . o'hara is also quite pleasant , as is o'shea as the ethically shaky matchmaker . and of course there's the scenery and the local irish color , which is very pleasant indeed . the matchmaker has a heavy strain of fish-out-of-water comedy to it , but it rarely reeks of formula thanks to mark joffe's low-key direction and garofolo's ability to underplay a reaction take . still , as the film strolls along towards its conclusion with a few unnecessary intrusions by the political sub-plot , it might be seen as a bit uninspired and tedious , objectively speaking . i'm not objectively speaking , of course . one viewer might find little to like about the matchmaker . another -- who shall remain nameless -- might spend 95 minutes smiling at a friendly face in a friendly place . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
1	mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 117 minutes . and then the movie ends . thornton and miramax feuded for a year over the length of the film , with the director originally turning in a two-and-a-half hour cut before finally paring it down to under two hours . the resulting film is the best evidence that thornton was right . all the pretty horses is a film that wants to achieve an epic scope , but where plot points keep rolling by so quickly that there's no time for anything to resonate . it's a picturesque travelogue made for short attention span theatre . and the complications progress from there . one of the most impressive elements of cormac mccarthy's novel was how he was able to take such a plot-heavy story and make it feel rich and profound . ted tally's script retains the laconic cowboy dialogue , but the structure is a mess . the set-up concerning john grady's fragmented family is dispatched in a few snippets of film and some voice-over , providing little foundation for the journey that is to come . in some earlier incarnation , tally may have provided more fleshing out for the individual story elements , more gradual build-up for the drama . in the two hours all the pretty horses now takes on screen , there's a sense in virtually every scene that someone was standing over the editor's shoulder , tapping his watch and muttering , " come on , we gotta get to the skinny-dipping come on , we gotta get to the knife fight . " the really unfortunate part is that you can see a quality film screaming to get loose . thomas is also solid , and lucas black grabs the screen in his smaller role as the high-strung blevins . it's easy to understand what the film-makers are reaching for in their exploration of a changing country and the disappearance of a slower , simpler way of life . it's far more difficult to get caught up in those themes while trying to keep up with the latest dramatic development in john grady's life . ordinarily , it might be worth commending all the pretty horses for not arbitrarily turning the romantic sub-plot into the entire focus of the film ( though it's still the entire focus of the ad campaign ) . this isn't really a story about john grady doin' the hoochie-coochie with his little senorita , and while penelope cruz is quite scrumptious to look at , she doesn't exactly create a complex character . it's a bit of a surprise when the film moves along for another twenty minutes or so of loose-end-tying after the love story has been resolved , but in this case , it doesn't feel like a daring or unconventional choice . it simply feels like another example of a film that's almost never in the moment , so desperate to dash off that you suspect the whole crew was renting its equipment by the minute . so much for a celebration of a slower , simpler way of life . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	a pleasant film that is not all that good as far as the crime caper story goes , but still has something about it that is endearing . it's in the tradition of hollywood films as escape vehicles , as it evokes a nostalgia for those kind of b-films that the studios used to routinely put out and were not that worried about the gaffes in the production . if you're a fan of the 1940s film noir , especially the classy billy wilder " double indemnity , " then you should find much in this latest woody allen comedy/mystery film to remind you of that film and others like it . woody sets this film in 1940 and catches with amazing accuracy the upholstered apartment furnishings , the lingo of the times , and the clothing worn and hairstyles . it was like watching one of those b-films , but instead of being in b & w this one is a lazy color version of it . it's the kind of faded out coloring that would have been used to make a 1940 film noir , if they were made in color . the retro scenes of all the interiors were exquisitely designed by santo loquasto and shot by zhao fei in mostly plum and gold colors that burnished on the screen . that's a home he made burglar-proof . admittedly this is all a thin and rather predictable story incorporating the usual woody nebbish sexist and egotististical character , and to make matters worse it comes with an unbelievable heist plot and with mechanical one-liners with silly double-entendre sexual meanings . it's a role that he's ritualized and could do it sleepwalking by now . but it worked for me because i didn't care about all that and instead got caught up with the film's casual look and the way it caught the look of the period's film noir , and i found the clash he had with helen hunt brought out the sides of his personality that he's battling within himself all his artistic life . woody seems more relaxed in this role than he has been in his more recent films . and , since the film has no artistic pretensions--it's more a homage to the b-films of the forties , it seemed easier to handle than some of his more recent ritualized woody-by-the-numbers flicks or those pale imitations of those european auteurs he so much admired like bergman--films he slavishly imitated that never worked for him . mind you , this is not a good film but one that can be viewed as an escape from reality . something that is not all that bad during these troubling economic days of that compassionate conservative administration of president bush . seeing this film made me forget for the moment about bush's war on stem cell research and the way he goes out of his way to please his extreme right-wing supporters and those big corporations that also supported him . the same purpose could be said of those early films in the forties , with the world being invaded by nazis . escape films were very much in vogue and served a purpose . i don't usually care for escape films , but every so often they feel right and can be enjoyable if you can really escape reality by watching them . those are the kinds of films i let my critical guard down on , and that's the case with this woody allen flick . 
1	freddie prinze jr . and julia stiles , the movie's likable stars , manage to be mildly interesting in a film that almost never is . the story has some intriguing story elements , but the director seems lost about what to do with them . and robert yeoman's bland and uninviting cinematography doesn't provide much support to a movie that could use some help . their initial exchange , with its excessively cute dialog , doesn't bode well for the rest of the story . when she gets -- quite unconvincingly -- tipsy , she blames it on her boozing style . the movie's only effective moments are the frequent asides that the leads give to the camera . in these they seem to be honestly talking about love , in contrast to their lack of much genuine chemistry when they're together . stiles tries hard , but the obvious conclusion is that she's better cast when she's nasty , as she was in 10 things i hate about you , than when she's nice , as she is here . much of the show concerns the many minor characters . when the movie can't keep the romance angle going , it falls back on teen movie clich ? s . it is rated pg-13 for sexual situations and profanity and would be acceptable for kids 12 and up . 
1	upon seeing the print ads and commercials for this movie , it might occur to you that this story has been done before--and you would be absolutely correct . those who have seen richard lester's '70s tongue-in-cheek version of the adventure should avoid this one , lest you feel compelled to hurl popcorn and invectives at the screen . the first indication of trouble with this movie is in the casting . it's not a stroke of brilliance to choose sheen , sutherland , and curry as the triumphant trio ( although , to his credit , sutherland does a credible job as a moody athos ) . it's an even worse choice to pick chris o'donnell as d'artagnan , since he seems more concerned about not messing up his perm than in giving a decent accounting of himself . tim curry is entirely too feeble to make a credible villain , and hugh o'connor's version of king louis looks like something out of bill and ted's excellent adventure . two performers are effective , but they're mostly smothered by all the ineptitude around them . michael wincott does a marvellous job as the villainous ex-musketeer rocheford ( and yes , there is a cheesy joke about the name ) . her role is small , but she's pretty good . which is more than can be said about numerous contrived circumstances and lines of dialogue . is loughery serious when he expects us to believe that a musketeer would actually ask , " you got a name , boy ? " something's rotten in the country of france , and if this script is anything to judge by , perhaps william shatner is shouldering entirely too much of the blame for the failure of the fifth star trek feature . the three musketeers is supposed to be high adventure and , while there are a few nice swordfights , most of the action isn't likely to provoke more than a " ho-hum " reaction . director stephen herek should go back to bill and ted's excellent adventure . he obviously doesn't have what it takes here . in much the same way that kevin costner's lifeless robin hood : prince of thieves butchered the legends of sherwood forest , so this film singlehandedly bludgeons the three musketeers . in this case , it's even worse , though . here , tim curry manages the dubious distinction of seeming restrained when going over-the-top . there have been other , better versions of this story . if there is a reason to see this movie , it's for the five-minute extended preview of disney's upcoming the lion king ( what we see is actually the opening musical number ) , but such quick satisfaction is hardly value for the dollar . " all for one , and one for all " may be the motto of the musketeers , but this latest filmed version of their exploits is all for naught . 
1	even though the film suffers from its aloof and uninviting approach , the figgis genius in staging scenes is very evident albeit in frequently subtle ways . nastassja kinski , who has aged 5 years in the past 15 , gives a sweet and delicate performance as karen , a rocket scientist -- really . whereas kinski once burst with raw sexual energy , see cat woman for example , here she has a charming innocence . her reserved allure outshines snipes , who spends more time than necessary brooding . this is all on the up-and-up even if a bit risky given the close proximity of two such attractive people . all of this would probably have come to nothing had a mugging not scared them badly , thereby bringing them together physically . the intimacy of their hug speaks volumes about their feelings even when their words deny it . " and we're both adults . it is the least i can do . " cutting in and out of the shadowy images , editor john smith and cinematographer declan quinn give the scene a gossamer beauty than has a mysteriously asexual feeling . this makes the already morose max even more depressed . how could he not love someone this terrific ? ever confident wen steals all of her scenes with snipes . although max specifically points out to the audience in the opening that he is not gay , the story introduces some doubt . downey , looking too well-fed for the part , does an excellent job of acting a prolonged death . the bifurcated movie would have been better served if it had chosen one subject rather than two . just when the infidelity aspects start to become interesting , it switches to the hospital room . the problem with the picture seems on the surface to be its plodding pacing , but actually the defect has to do more with the approach figgis takes with the material . the rarely compelling movie takes an ethereal attitude about much of the activities . and everyone seems somehow removed from the material even though all of their acting , with the possible exception of snipes , is good . the ending suffers from excessive cuteness and a twist from out of left field but manages to work anyway . one night stand is a film that is less than the sum of its parts . figgis misses the mark slightly but makes an interesting picture nevertheless . it is rated r for drug usage , sex , nudity , profanity , and adult themes . it would be acceptable for older and mature teenagers . 
1	screenplay : susan shilliday and bill wittliff . director : edward zwick . legends of the fall is a big , dumb bassett hound of a movie . it stares at you with big sad eyes , slobbers all over you and practically begs you to like it . it's muddled , bombastic , and often gets by purely on style points , yet for some reason , inexplicably , it also manages to be occasionally entertaining . i could spend days listing all the things that are wrong with legends of the fall , and still i'd be left with the fact that something worked . radiating the kind of charisma that screen actors just don't seem to have any more , he single-handedly makes legends of the fall watchable . for about half an hour , legends of the fall is more than simply passable ; it's a grand , beautifully filmed family drama with tremendous potential . all the performances are perfectly tuned , the interactions between the brothers are convincing and the story is well-paced . a film which had been moving along at a confident and leisurely pace suddenly goes into a dead sprint that seems to get faster and faster , until by the end i felt quite relieved that it was over . fortunately , the film's technical credits are spectacular . director edward zwick scored a successful screen melodrama with glory , and he appears to use many of the same tricks in legends . in fact , the war scenes here might easily have been the same scenes from glory with different uniforms added by computer . the score is by james horner , and as usual he lays the strings on thick as syrup , but it works in legends . as the narrative becomes more and more stream of consciousness , the look and sound of legends of the fall actually seem to improve . for all that , the best thing that zwick puts on the screen is pitt . he is asked to slog through several melodramatic moments in legends of the fall , but his dark intensity keeps them from being as overblown as they might have been , and he may be as convincing a crier as any male actor in many years . then zwick comes through with an exceptional final fifteen minutes , including a retribution montage which might strike some as a bit too reminiscent of the godfather films yet works in its own right . legends of the fall is by no stretch of the imagination great filmmaking , and occasionally it's flat-out silly . however , when you put an ascending star in an old-fashioned western epic , anything is possible . and for legends of the fall , it's just enough . 
0	hav plenty , as we are told in the beginning and reminded during the film , is a true story . life itself is a series of true stories , but most are not movie material . as scripted , directed , and acted by cinematic newcomer christopher scott cherot , hav plenty limps along at best . its dialog is so stilted - " you know what they say , 'no women ; no cry . ' " - that the actors are content to read the screenplay rather than invest much energy in trying to act it . he's a man who knows his mind , which he frequently shares directly with the audience in a series of trite and overly cute monologues . hav plenty's story doesn't go anywhere . at the end it subjects us to lee plenty's new film , which is a movie of the movie we've just seen , but with even worse acting . " remember folks that , as outrageous as this all seems , this is a true story . " hav tells the camera , but the problem is that it's not outrageous at all or even the least bit interesting . hav plenty isn't so much a bad film as it is a total waste of the audience's time . hav plenty runs 1 : 32 . it is rated r for profanity and would be fine for most teenagers . 
2	they invite a dozen of their friends to watch it and they do the play , sans costumes , just for the sheer enjoyment of acting . louis malle heard of this and decided to film and direct one of these gatherings . you may remember mamet from many of his well written movies--my favorites being house of games ( 1987 ) and things change ( 1988 ) . his staccato style of terse , biting , and thought provoking dialog is unrivaled . ( okay , it is sort of like harold pinter , but pinter is so depressing ) . sad to say the love is not mutual . there are several other actors and actresses with important parts in the play . all did a wonderful job , but for me it was shawn and moore that really stood out as giving terrific performances . i do not remember the original uncle vanya so i can not say for sure how much mamet modified it , but i suspect a fair amount . i found the dialog fairly perfect as presented in this movie . i recommend vanya on 42nd street to everyone old enough to be interested in serious material . it is rated pg simply because of its adult themes--there is no sex , nudity , or violence of any kind . it is not a happy movie , but it is a very thought provoking one . i award it * * * 1/2 . it runs a well paced 1 : 59 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	in a movie that never rings true , martha is the most unbelievable character of the lot . with fashion model looks , make-up , clothing and jewelry , martha doesn't appear to have ever come any closer to poverty than an overcharged american express platinum card . " all of my life i was told that if i worked hard and stayed out of trouble , my life would be a fairy tale . " fiennes isn't given much to do other than mope around with a single sad sack expression . still , his dour look is so exceedingly handsome it almost makes up for his character's lack of energy . he likes nothing better than showing off his crude behavior by obscene verbal jousting with his buddies . or more precisely , himself " with breasts . " as ploddingly directed by nick hamm , the movie is a romance without much genuine chemistry and a comedy without any laughs . best viewed as a small , melancholic drama , the by-the-numbers story takes few chances . why couldn't the writer introduce some ambiguity and real mystery into the tale and not make the outcome so obvious ? the movie's saving grace , to the extent it has any , is a nice but completely predictable conclusion . the ending's few fun twists add a little spice to an otherwise bland film . the very thought of you runs 1 : 28 . it is rated r for profanity and would be acceptable for teenagers . [we saw the film abroad without the aid of an mpaa rating and suspected , incorrectly , that it was a pg-13 film . ] my son jeffrey , age 10 , didn't think much of the movie , giving it just * 1/2 . he didn't like frank's language and found the story confusing at times . 
0	body shots , directed by michael cristofer and written by david mckenna , is perhaps the shallowest movie of the year . like a porn movie stripped of most of its images , the film features characters who talk incessantly and obsessively about orgasms and oral sex . some sex is acted out , but mainly the characters appear to enjoy talking about sex more than doing it . with so many ludicrous scenes , it's hard to pick an example . before the first line in the movie is spoken , the director has one character urinate on a closed toilet seat and another vomit . the movie proceeds to flashback and work its way up to the alleged rape . they should be required to wear numbers so we can tell them apart . only livingston from office space manages to give his character any uniqueness . every scene in the film rings false . one character , for example , who has a desk among a sea of desks , plays a loud porn video on his office pc . the dialog is so ridiculous that it might be laughably bad if the actors would slow down long enough to let us enjoy its stupidity . " so , are you an aspiring actress ? " " you're a director ? " the movie reveals to men how women can tell a real gentleman from a fake . it tries to be a message movie as well as a sexual titillation film . " sex without love equals violence , " one guy repeats like it's his mantra . actually , the characters don't think any deeper than their sexual urges , which they share with us ad nauseam . eventually the hyperactive movie does get to the " rape . " slowing to a crawl , the story examines in laborious detail the two participants' view of what happened . or is the blonde bombshell telling the truth that it was date rape ? the movie argues that in such situations the truth is not knowable . the ending does at least bring out some emotions from the cast , but it is shamelessly manipulative and not credible . it is rated r for strong sexual content including graphic sex-related dialogue , language , violence and scenes of alcohol abuse . think of it as nc-17 and don't let your teens go unless they are older and mature . 
1	unfortunately , perhaps because first time writer/director miguel arteta is attempting to tackle too many issues , or because he doesn't have a good feel for anything below the surface , much of this movie comes across as shallow and melodramatic . spain's stiff and unconvincing performance does little to draw us into his character's life and bring us face-to-face with his many dilemmas . while i can't think of another film that covers all of the ground traversed by star maps , the film frequently ventures into territory that was examined more effectively by such diverse offerings as my family , once were warriors , and johns . as a result , watching star maps is likely to generate a sense of deja vu . someone once said that all movies are basically copies of others , and , while it doesn't always seem that way , in this case it does . there's enough material in star maps to keep a soap opera going for several weeks , if not months . the characters are all drawn broadly , and the direction lacks subtlety ( the moment we see a bottle of pills being hidden behind some cans , we know it's going to be important later in the film ) . there are a pair of interesting personalities here -- carlos' sister , maria , and pepe's mistress , letti -- but neither is accorded enough screen time to do more than briefly arrest our attention . for the most part , the acting is amateurish , which is disappointing , although not surprising , considering the film's low budget . but , while the movie lacks strong performances , its greatest weakness is the writing . in trying to original , arteta inserts several offbeat comic sequences ( carlos accepting an oscar after an award-winning performance in bed , a bizarre dinner conversation ) that , while funny as stand-alone pieces , clash violently with the overriding tone . the ending is also problematic . while it's supposed to be ambiguous , it's actually frustrating , leaving all sorts of loose ends dangling . despite all of its flaws , however , star maps still has a soap opera-type appeal . it's not the kind of movie many people will walk out on , because , even considering its lack of depth , it retains the ability to hook a viewer into wondering what happens next . there's enough sex , violence , and boiling-point emotion to capture the attention of even the most easily-distracted viewer . ultimately , however , star maps doesn't amount to much more than several ideas that are never effectively translated into anything more potent than sudsy drivel .

2	the film critic , jonathan rosenbaum , has written a great review on the merits of jacques demy and his film , the umbrellas of cherbourg , going on to compare demy to the great japanese film director , yasujiro ozu . that both men achieved excellent success in their films by portraying the human condition through the eyes of normal lifestyles is , indeed , a curious oddity . umbrellas is made into an opera-like film by composer michel legrand . the actors sing their lines rather than just say them . the film itself is lushly colored in pastels , offering a very brilliant color-coordinated production . this story doesn't seem to be much on paper , but it is as poignant , as surely as it is ordinary . it is one that happens most of the time , rather than the reverse being true , of people marrying for love . and that is demy's point , that coincidences , luck , and good timing seem to matter even more than love . everything about this film was done to perfection . demy is one of the most underrated directors of french cinema . american audiences rarely get a chance to see his great body of films , and that is surely their loss . 
2	you say . let me say upfront that for whatever reason , probably thanks to director kevin lima ( tarzan ) , 102 dalmatians is much better than it's immediate predecessor , 101 dalmatians . ( neither , however , is better than the animated original . ) glenn close , having a ball chewing up the scenery , is terrific , but it's the dogs that make the show . the best dog of the bunch has to be the eminently lovable oddball . this lack of dots gives oddball lots of opportunities to get into trouble trying to acquire them . the spilled ink from a photocopier's toner cartridge is just one such source of black splotches . oddball is mr . mischief and the dog most likely to appear in the dog endangerment scenes that make the film's g rating a bit questionable . ( there were several blood curdling screams from little tykes in our audience when it looked like oddball was going to be a goner . ) an unusual dog , he has colorful feathers and a beak , although he doesn't think he can fly . giving a single animal the ability of speech makes the story funny without being too silly . sometimes the simplest scenes of the dogs wagging their tails are so cute that you can't help but break into a big smile . and the sets and the costumes alone can provoke quite a few laughs . depardieu doesn't have much of a part , but he makes the most of it . always pronouncing puppies as " poopies , " he sounds like he just walked off the rugrats set . 102 dalmatians is first and foremost a movie ripe with physical comedy . the dialog is treated as almost an afterthought . so what video would a bunch of dogs want to watch when their master is on a date ? in one of the story's best sequences , the movie cuts between the video and kevin and chloe enjoying spaghetti just like lady and the tramp . on the whole , however , 102 dalmatians is a good spirited movie that rarely disappoints . it is rated g , but the " poopie " endangerment scenes may scare some kids under 5 . my son jeffrey , age 11 , gave the film * * * . he really liked oddball and waddlesworth , but complained that he missed the dogs from the first movie . maxim , age 12 , went wild over the picture and gave it * * * * . nickolas , age 11 , gave it * * * 1/2 , having similar comments to jeffrey's . eliot , age 11 , on the other hand , hated the movie , giving it just * 1/2 . he complained that it wasn't original and that it didn't link properly to the first film . the votes from the rest of jeffrey's 6th grade class were quite positive although there were a few who didn't like it . 
1	cast : renee zellweger , christopher eccleston , glenn fitzgerald , allen payne , julianna margulies , kathleen chalfant , shelton dane director : boaz yakin producers : lawrence bender , jon penotti screenplay : boaz yakin cinematography : adam holender music : lesley barber u . s . distributor : miramax films a price above rubies is writer/director boaz yakin's follow-up to his highly-regarded , tautly-paced 1994 picture , fresh . sadly , little of the energy and intelligence of the earlier film is evident in this , an overwrought melodrama populated by stereotypes and featuring an improbable storyline that relies upon a string of coincidences . ostensibly , a price above rubies details the struggle of one woman to throw off the shackles of a conservative society , but the manner in which yakin approaches this theme is preachy , pedantic , and predictable . mendel rationalizes his actions by saying that , while everyone sins , " it's the quality of our sins which sets us apart . " i needn't say which path sonia chooses , because , like almost everything else in this movie , it's easily guessed . one of the most disappointing aspects of a price above rubies is its lack of originality ? right down to the too-pat conclusion . the premise has a great deal of potential , little of which is realized . instead of fashioning a gallery of interesting , multi-dimensional characters around sonia , yakin is content to plunder a bag of types . that's only the tip of the proverbial iceberg , however . one of the most potentially-fascinating elements of a price above rubies is the opportunity it affords for an exploration of the hasidic society . a price above rubies makes the not-dissimilar hasidic people look cartoonish by comparison . yakin's casting choices are also questionable . christopher eccleston , who was impressive as the title character in 1996's jude , is flat and unconvincing as sender . there's no passion or power in this performance ; it's a dull , lifeless rendering of a man who is supposed to be deeply devout . i'm not suggesting that eccleston should have gone down the route taken by robert duvall in the apostle , but a little more energy might have made sender seem less like a writer's construct and more like an individual . the flaw in renee zellweger's performance is harder to define . there are numerous instances when zellweger's intonations and accent are all wrong . it's the little things that are problematic . a price above rubies isn't a complete disaster . despite its obvious faults , the melodrama is never boring . my reservations about zellweger's performance don't alter the fact that sonia is an appealing protagonist , and it's not hard to identify with her struggles . unlike many of the other characters in the film , she is well-developed , although certain facets of her personality are built through clich ? s . so , although a price above rubies can be described as " watchable , " it stands as a mediocre exploration of one woman's attempts to express her individuality in a closed society .

1	fire , director deepa mehta's film of indian middle-class passions and constraints , stars the lovely actresses nandita das as sita and shabana azmi as radha . their simplistic tale of woe will elicit your compassion , but the thin story wanes by the second half , leaving little to remember except for a . r . actually , all of the men in the story ignore the women unless they want something like their next meal . in contrast , the film's heterosexual liaisons are made to look harsh and brutal , which in this story they are . although the acting is pleasant enough , the script by the director suffers from a paucity of ideas . his characters are handsomely outlined but never adequately filled in . after a strange ending with an ambiguous and confusing message , the ending credits roll . the lasting impression of the film is not of people but of images . it is in english and is not rated but would be r for sex , brief nudity , and mature themes . it would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are older and mature . although it is a handsome film , there is not enough compelling content for me to be to be able to recommend it . i give it * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

" unfortunately , his writing makes for a perfect hollywood screenplay--lots of action and not much originality . the client's greatest disadvantage is its flat plot , which includes few ( if any ) surprises and revolves on a premise that we've seen before--in the firm and the pelican brief , among others . the client's premise is tenuous in its believability . why ? i guess we're supposed to believe that the kid is scared and confused , but he does enough clear-headed things to limit the plausibility of this explanation . despite plot holes and contrivances , the client is a well-made motion picture . everything about it ( except the screenplay ) is top-notch . the cast is impeccable . newcomer brad renfro portrays mark with a palpable mix of anger and fear . susan sarandon gives her usual solid performance , and tommy lee jones oozes equal parts charisma and false charm . mary-louise parker , one of the better representatives of today's crop of twentysomething actors , is underused as mark's mother dianne , but she makes the most of every scene she's in . schumacher has succeeded where two other accomplished directors ( sydney pollack , who did the firm , and alan pakula , of the pelican brief ) have failed : bringing a grisham novel to the screen in a manner that's more entertaining than trying . this isn't a masterpiece of suspense , but it has its moments and is capable of providing some light summer entertainment . i think from now on , i'll skip reading grisham's books and wait for the movies . if nothing else , it will save me some time . 
0	of course , we already know that . the film , nevertheless , wants to teach what we already know and do it like a kid's golden book . as directed by hugh hudson and scripted by paula milne and susan shilliday , the episodes in kuki's life fly by at channel-surfing speed . sure . the result is that episodes run by with the speed of cheetahs , and the director rarely takes time to set up any of them properly . okay , done with that idea . what , you may ask , happened next ? we're never told . storms blow in without warning and then are over with and forgotten before you can get interested . go to the restroom , and you'll miss a minimum of two disasters . the script reeks with clich ? s . " what kind of people do this ? " " we don't . it runs us . " one thing can unequivocally be said about the movie , bernard lutic's cinematography is stunning . but think about the material with which he had to work . then again , some movies ( fools rush in , for example ) can make even the grand canyon look ugly , so lutic could have blown it . my friend with me reminded me of a similar and much better show , " the flame trees of thika , " which played two decades ago on masterpiece theater . the problem with i dreamed of africa is that it tells a story that we've heard many times before and usually with a much stronger emotional impact . perhaps if the film were recut with fewer incidents and more development of the ones left , it might have worked . but , as released , it only works as a travelogue . i dreamed of africa runs 1 : 52 . it is rated pg-13 for a scene of nudity/sensuality and some violent/traumatic episodes and would be acceptable for teenagers . 
0	about the nicest thing i can say about a steven seagal film is that the average offering from the man who personifies wooden acting is more entertaining than sitting in traffic . fire down below , seagal's latest ( which seems just like his next-to-latest ) , is just about average . it offers what seagal fans have come to expect from their icon : a healthy dose of ego and a lot of fights in which no one ever lays a finger on the star . it's a known fact that the more violent a seagal movie is , the more enjoyable it is . to that end , fire down below could have used a few more fight scenes to cut down on such unimportant irritants as the laughable attempts at plot and character development . let me say up front that i believe seagal to be totally sincere in his concern for the environment , but it strikes me that preaching about it in an action film is not the best arena . it's not only a distraction , but it comes across as both sanctimonious and hypocritical . ( it's okay for seagal to beat the crap out of anyone who looks cross-eyed at him , but don't you dare dump that glowing green stuff down a mine shaft ! ) his means -- any and all necessary , and the more violent , the better . there's also an obligatory love interest , played with a distinct lack of enthusiasm by marg helgenberger , and a dull sidekick who is listlessly essayed by the normally-reliable harry dean stanton . seagal must demand that actors in his films discard any inherent talent so there's no threat of stealing scenes from him . however , by including an incest subplot and creating so many idiotic , cartoonish villains for seagal to beat up , it actually reinforces the unflattering image . at one point , taggart makes a comment about possibly coming to live in the area . i think we're supposed to infer that he's in awe of the beauty of the appalachians , but it seems more likely that he has been seduced by the thought of so many readily-available punching bags . the action scenes are adequately directed ( by felix enriquez alcala , a tv director making the crossover to feature films ) , and there's a genuinely tense truck-and-car chase that is worth about 90 seconds of moderate excitement . the rest of the film is all by-the-book stuff , but that's what's expected whenever the name " steven seagal " tops the marquee .

2	it was suddenly possible to see humans and dinosaurs interacting in a way that had never before been possible , and to feel the entire theater shake with the approach of a tyrannosaurus rex . effects houses like industrial lights and magic have tackled bigger , more imposing objects such as tornadoes and volcanoes , but it's still basically the same technology that jurassic park ushered in . and , because the lost world doesn't offer anything especially innovative , it seems rather familiar and almost ( but not quite ) disappointing . like its predecessor , the lost world is basically a big-budget monster movie of the sort that has been popular ever since the dawn of motion pictures . unfortunately , like many entries into the genre , it falls into expected patterns . as a result , much of this movie seems like a retread of jurassic park ( with a little king kong thrown in at the end ) , not because director steven spielberg is intentionally copying himself , but because there's really not much more that he can do with the premise . if there's a third movie in the series , it will probably follow pretty much the same storyline as the first and second installments . still , repetitiveness notwithstanding , the lost world boasts several edge-of-the-seat moments . the standout sequence in this film features two t- rexs , a lot of rain , spiderweb fissures in glass , and a literal cliffhanger . next year's godzilla will hopefully do a more impressive job with the " dinosaur loose in a city " concept . returning from the first film is jeff goldblum as dr . ian malcolm , a mathematician with an analytical mind and a wry sense of humor . the differences between jurassic park and the lost world can be summed up relatively simply : more dinosaurs , fewer legitimate thrills . in this case , familiarity doesn't breed contempt , but it results in a movie that's unlikely to keep viewers going back time-after-time the way they did for the original . the lost world is solid entertainment the first time ; it's not something i have any great desire to sit through again . if so , it really doesn't work . the self-deprecating scientist is likable exclusively because of jeff goldblum ; even after two films , he's still relatively one-dimensional . meanwhile , arliss howard represents the obligatory nasty corporate villain type . perhaps the most disappointing thing about the lost world is how perfunctory and unimaginative steven spielberg's direction often is . in his more than two decades of film making , spielberg has been responsible for a variety of innovative action/adventure movies -- jaws , raiders of the lost ark , and jurassic park , to name a few . the magical spark that characterizes so many spielberg films is largely absent . it is to this year what independence day was to last year -- the summer's single " can't miss " motion picture ( or so the advertisers would have us believe ) . it also comes early enough in the season so that we're not already sick to death of this kind of effects-oriented action/adventure . so , although the lost world has its share of problems , chief of which is the familiarity factor , it still offers a couple hours of glitzy , hi-tech fun . and that's just about all that anyone can reasonably expect from this kind of blockbuster .

" are you really my daddy ? " michael asks his father in one of the few funny lines in a laugh-starved movie . " you've seen me 5 or 6 times , " his father replies . " don't you remember ? " a slow moving tale of poorly drawn characters , the movie has a strong cast , but the script gives the players little to say that is worth hearing . shot mainly with interior scenes , the movie spends most of its time in uninteresting small talk among the sisters . one keeps hoping that something awful will happen to one of them to get the narrative going . instead , we get an hour and a half of director pat o'connor running out the clock . bill whelan's luxurious music and kenneth macmillan's radiant cinematography outshine the threadbare storyline . this dreadfully dull film will have you looking in vain for something to keep your interest lest you begin to nod off . it is hard to believe that the poorly scripted movie would have been green-lighted for production without streep . given the script , it is equally hard to understand why streep agreed to do the movie . on stage , the play may have worked , but this movie version doesn't . " do you know what i'm thinking ? " maggie asks toward the end of the picture . i confess that my immediate reaction was , " no , and i don't care . " by then they had wasted an hour and half of fine film stock with nothing to show for their work other than wasting the audience's time . sometimes even a fine cast is unable to save a dismal endeavor . it is rated pg for mature themes and would be fine for kids around 12 and up . there is nothing to offend younger kids , but they will probably be bored . 
1	what sparkles through the two hours of its production is the magnificent ensemble cast , who are able to make the superficial lives they are portraying seem colorful and their story worth telling . these four unlikable men indulge us with how they prey on the weak . these men are not just materialists and users of people , but are truly depraved human beings . eddie , as the central figure of the story , is probably the one who is the most out of it , either because of his heavy cocaine sniffing or his tremendous vanity or his inability to know the difference between what is real and what is false . because of the sharp dialogue and the ability of the actors to get under the skin of their characters , this morbid look at humanity seems poignant . its humor is in the form of sarcasm and scorn , which is a mean-spirited way to look at others , though mickey says he is flip not sarcastic . his retorts and dry comebacks are flip humor used in the sense that we are all going under , so why be that serious about life ! it is ruptured when eddie finally tells him with cruel honesty , we need guys like you in hollywood to make the bullshit look real . you're expendable . you do not matter . this is not a great drama as much as it is a black comedy that has great acting and intriguing dialogue . even a long lasting relationship between eddie and phil can't be viewed as necessarily a sincere one . " phil is very safe , because no matter how far you manage to fall , phil will be lower . " as an interesting gesture to the media age of the 1980s , drazen uses the tv images we view from the channel-changing eddie , showing how meaningless and bland everything seems on the screen : tragedies , wars and football games are all manufactured as significant events by the media but all meld into insignificance in one's daily life , with no follow-up search for the truth in these stories taking place . this was a tough film to like and an even tougher film to hate . its appeal is hypnotic , in the sense that we are overhearing conversations we shouldn't be hearing but we can't stop listening to them . if we met these types in our personal lives , more than likely , we couldn't stand to be around them long enough to be sufficiently entertained by them . for two hours to see them on film is also too long to be around them . an 80-to-90 minute film , honed down and made more mobile , taking away some of its staginess , would have suited me just fine . 
0	his life is a dreary , loveless mess . this film is noted for showing the slum side to beautiful oslo , where we see crime , ugly buildings , the subway , and problems outsiders do not associate with this peaceful and scenic country . the film spends most of the first half of the movie showing him to be a screw off , everything he touches he fouls up , a complete loser-- there is a long tradition of hollywood comedians who have exploited that avenue of comedy . his comic effect , is a deadpan expression , that absorbs all criticism that comes his way . what is funny , is the way he looks at us , as he looks at the camera , showing us his hurt feelings and pathetic nature , emphasizing to us that he is a natural screw up . but the picture has darker ulterior motives than that , it will chuck out all the work it did setting up the film as a fluff piece of comedy and go for the criminal aspects to the story , a decision that has to change how we approach seeing this film , we can no longer be content to relax , laughing at this inept mailman , we have to now see how he handles himself under fire , while the director , also , tries to bring romance into the story . as far as i am concerned , the film loses track of what it is capable of doing at this point of the story , and it becomes a different film , where one contrived situation after another occurs to keep the story suspenseful , with the buffoon-like georg menacing roy . roy is now the subject of a film that doesn't know if it wants to be viewed as a suspense or romance yarn , or just as a plain comedy . roy still acts with the same deadpan expression , as a result , everything becomes muddled and ridiculous . the laugh situations seem forced , the romance absurd , and the suspense unreal . at best , i found this film to be a modest effort at comedy , that results in a modest film , barely being less than annoying , but redeemed by showing me the darker side of oslo , a side that i have not seen before on screen . so i think that this first time director , who is guilty of trying to come up with too many different twists to the story , and by relying on a hero to carry the film who is not very likable , and a story line that is very thin , has defeated the comic efforts that he was successful with during the first part of the film , but by the end of the film , wears down to a barely passable effort at comedy . 
0	leatrice is also responsible for popularizing the bobbed hair look , which was the style of her hair for this film . this is fluff romantic/comedy that has many holes in the story ; this makes the film lacking in certain basic standards of filmmaking . it's also reflective of the 1920s male chauvinistic attitude toward women , where it can be said with a straight face by one of the main lady characters : " that a man wants beauty not brains in a woman . " and aren't you wonderful ! when he demonstrates the machine , doolittle sneakily fixes it so it splatters over all those watching the demo . it's also beyond me how the family could invite someone as devious as that into their home . but , in any case , the brainy a . b . that seems to be the way a 'feel good' movie went in those days , as it leaves the audience with a happy feeling . this same formula is still used by the hollywood film , but the film's are much more polished today . the clinging vine is not a good film by any stretch of the imagination , but it does present an historical perspective of those silent era times . 
1	exhilaration please , not exhaustion . full of self-importance , directors this christmas season have lost all sense of proportion . movies seem to take an eternity for no discernable reason . in his non-musical anna and the king , rather than giving us something for our minds and our hearts , andy tennant gives us butt-numbing length as we watch what is admittedly an absolutely gorgeous picture . the cinematography ( caleb deschanel ) , the sets ( ian whittaker and luciana arrighi ) , the costumes ( jenny beavan ) and the music ( george fenton ) are all absolutely dazzling . but with steve meerson and peter krikes's pedestrian script , there is little to engage us . the net result of such beauty , scored to lush orchestral music , is to literally put us to sleep as it did several men , women and children in my packed audience . the fault does not lie with the actors . the chemistry between them is never quite believable , but it really isn't their fault . the written material they have to work with is awkward , and tennant's direction is languid . in a key scene , for example , in which blowing up a bridge quickly is the key to survival , tennant has his actors move with a glacial pace . we get the point that the siamese in the picture do not speak proper english , and their butchered english syntax and semantics can be funny . but , after a while , this repetitive joke gets quite tiresome . so would songs have been an improvement ? you bet ! visuals are important , but they aren't enough to carry a picture . anna and the king needs something to make it compelling , and a few songs certainly wouldn't hurt . a large part of the film is in thai with english subtitles . it is rated pg-13 for some intense violent sequences . given the explicitness of the bloody caning and some of the other scenes , the film might have been more appropriately rated r . it would be acceptable for teenagers . 
0	without any of the refinements he has shown in some of his latter films , jim carrey , as ace ventura , keeps the humor in this one insufferably crude . never has a film been less in need of a sequel than this one , but after making over a hundred million dollars in 1994 , there has , regrettably , already been one sequel . in need of a better script than the one by jack bernstein , carrey , and the director , tom shadyac , carrey struts his stuff without restraint . carrey is an undeniable comedic genius but one in need of control . as proof of how good carrey can be , consider his relatively more restrained performances in liar , liar and the mask . the rest of the movie is the same , ad nauseam . the script is devoid of ideas , and the movie plays as if it were one long ad lib routine by carrey . she and all of the other actors provide little more than a backdrop for carrey's showing off . ace ventura has one memorable scene -- the ending credits , which bring blessed relief . it is rated pg-13 for profanity , nudity , and crude sexual humor . the movie would be acceptable for most kids ten and up . my son jeffrey , age 8 1/2 , said he really liked it and especially thought ace was funny . he volunteered that he believed the movie should be for kids 10 and up because of the sex stuff in it . 
2	i wish i hadn't known so much about i'll do anything . i wish i hadn't known that it was written as a musical , and that the songs had been edited out after disastrous test screenings . i wish i hadn't found myself trying to guess where the songs would have gone , or wondering what might have been different . then maybe , just maybe , i would have enjoyed it even more than i did . as aware as i was of its bumps , i was still mostly delighted by i'll do anything , and the reason why can be summed up in two words : whittni wright . the fact is that i'll do anything shouldn't have worked at all . kavner's watching brooks schmooze in a posh restaurant ? ) , or to notice some particularly choppy editing . the hollywood satire element never really hits stride , because it doesn't hit hard enough and because the player already did it better . ullman's character sports an appalling georgia accent , and the six year time shifts don't allow for any rhyme or reason to her eventual , rather tenuous emotional state or why she spoils jeannie so terribly . there are plenty of holes in i'll do anything , and a few more might have spelled disaster . consequently , i consider it fortunate that i fell in love with whittni wright the moment she appeared on screen . wright is a magnificent jeannie , reducing matt to a whimper of " i have absolutely no idea what to do when she throws a spectacular temper tantrum on a plane . unlike so many young performers , she never struck me as overly precious or self-aware , just winningly adorable . as many times as " parent learns responsibility " stories have been done , i was still completely charmed by this one . nolte and wright are great together , and i found myself smiling almost every minute they were on screen together . as he has done in his previous films , terms of endearment and broadcast news , james l . brooks fills the screen with quirky characters and clever dialogue . joely richardson is lovely and appealing as cathy , the development exec who wants to take a stand but can't quite work up the nerve , and she uses her splayed-leg sitting position to give cathy an aura of perpetual insecurity . albert brooks is good but underused as the cocky big-budget producer , and julie kavner gets off some of the best lines as the voice of honesty . it's too bad the relationships between those characters are generally so sketchy , gutted of some of their emotion byt the removal of the production numbers . still , the one relationship that really mattered worked so well that i was tremendously forgiving . i'll do anything may not be the smoothest of rides , but nolte and wright did such a fine job of winning my heart that i was more than willing to take that ride with them . 
2	screenplay : robert rodat . producers : steven spielberg , ian bryce , mark gordon & gary levinsohn . director : steven spielberg . mpaa rating : r ( intense wartime violence and gore , profanity ) running time : 170 minutes . the first and last image in saving private ryan , a war story of shattering visceral and emotional force , is an american flag waving in the breeze . it's a bold choice , one that defines what makes this film so unique among modern war films . for over 25 years in the post-vietnam era , american war films have reminded us over and over again that war is a chaotic and futile endeavor characterized by gleeful brutality and morality of convenience . even the most well-received examples -- the deer hunter , apocalypse now , platoon , full metal jacket -- trafficked in violence and psychological devastation as though they were the only facets of the wartime experience worth exploring . the stories were less about the people in war than about war itself as an existential disease . saving private ryan may be the most mature war film ever made , because it combines the horrifying realism of contemporary war films with the sense of purpose conveyed in the patriotic adventures of the 1940s . the reluctance of miller's men to take on this mission is understandable , since it's amazing enought that any of them survived the initial assault on the beach . it's hard to begin describing the film artistry involved : that half hour is disturbing , surreal , at times darkly humorous , simultaneously too intense to watch and impossible _not_ to watch . if it had been spielberg's intent to play a game of wartime can-you-top-this with his contemporary peers -- and you never believe for a second that it was -- the contest wouldn't even be close . cinematic warfare has never been more agonizing . nor , in its way , has it ever been more human . hanks delivers his finest performance yet as miller , whose trembling hand betrays demons his men can only guess at ; barry pepper radiates steely-eyed confidence as sharpshooter pvt . the most harrowing performance , however , comes from jeremy davies as cpl . in one brilliantly acted scene , upham's psyche vanishes into the rubble . this being a tale of the " last noble war " in american history , it's also about heroism , though not in a conventional sense . faced with an assignment everyone considers fubar -- an acronym for the saltier version of " fouled up beyond all recognition " -- miller and his men are forced to make it make sense . this is the sort of heroism saving private ryan examines : not the heroism of men fighting an obviously evil enemy for an obviously just cause , but the heroism of men taking responsibility for doing their duty to the best of their ability . it becomes the ability to make meaning from the hell war always has been and always will be . steven spielberg , who set a new standard for himself with schindler's list , actually manages to raise that standard in saving private ryan , which isn't to say that it's a perfect film . john williams score may not be as intrusive as it was in amistad -- but then , how _could_ it be ? -- but it still underscores scenes best left silent , and one late scene is a bit too reminiscent of schindler's " i could have done more " speech . yet even in that moment spielberg drives home his unique , provocative vision . late in the film , a character tells ryan , " earn this , " handing him the responsibility for making his life -- and the lives of those who died for his sake -- matter . that waving flag which opens and closes saving private ryan is a challenging sort of patriotism , free from self-righteous over-simplifications like " good war " vs . " bad war . " with the grace and power of great cinema , spielberg makes accountability in the midst of tragedy absolutely individual . he forces you to stare inward and ask whether you've earned this -- this life , this country , this freedom . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
1	a few months ago , i was at a press screening for another touchstone film which was preceded by a teaser trailer for mission to mars . as the trailer unfolded , the critics in the audience began to snicker with increasing frequency . the imagery used was startling similar to images from 2001 : a space odyssey -- an astronaut in a white room , an approach to a dark object in the distance , a figure spinning off into space . it was comical not just because of the familiarity , but because it seemed so quintessentially brian de palma . the train station sequence in the untouchables came from eisenstein's potemkin ; the single-take opening sequence in snake eyes felt like welles' touch of evil ; whole heaping chunks of his early films appropriated hitchcockian devices and themes . so why wouldn't de palma take on the most iconic science-fiction film ever made while making his first science-fiction film ? why not add kubrick to his list of victims of auteur homage ? it's more alarming that it's similar to the cookie-cutter hollywood approach to any story . the frustrating thing about any brian de palma film is that you can always count on at least one extended sequence where you realize what a brilliant technical craftsman he can be . a chain reaction of events following that accident keeps building tension , leading to some genuinely tense moments . de palma's sense for timing this sort of sequence is impeccable -- recall the editing of tom cruise's computer room break-in in mission : impossible -- leading to the hope that mission to mars can maintain that sort of visual and emotional energy . and then you remember this is brian de palma . every once in a while , by sheer twisted accident , de palma ends up working with a rich , smart script -- the untouchables , blow out , carlito's way . more often , you get the impression that he looks for a script with a few places he can show off his visual flair . mission to mars has its showcase sequence , but it also has a leaden script full of plug-and-play characterizations . it's the sort of mawkish back-story screenwriters use all the time in adventure films , in a token -- and usually futile -- attempt to show that the people matter more than the concept . ironically , mission to mars is that rare case where the concept does matter more than the people . when mission to mars gets metaphysical , it makes sure there's someone on hand to narrate every brutally obvious revelation , and someone whose individual journey to wholeness will be completed by this close encounter . this film doesn't end with the awe of creation ; it ends with tedious exposition topped off by an interplanetary clasping of hands . there are flashes of brian de palma the visceral thrill-master in mission to mars , but he doesn't seem to know what to do with its limp conclusion . this time around , it probably would have been a good idea . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
2	this emotionally moving film will look into that and will also examine the heart aches of two working class girls , doing it in a way only the french can do it justice . isa is someone we think we know but really don't , as she is prone to be friendly and willing to make relationships , opening her dark saucer eyes wide and offering an engaging smile full of her milky white teeth to go along with her warm personality and trim look of close-cropped black hair ; but , we are , also , distracted by a mysterious scar she has on her right eyebrow , which is never explained . there is a classic look of disgust on the face of isa , that seems to be saying , you are really sick , when she finally realizes that she has to move on from here . the performances of the two actresses was bewitching , as the two women deservedly shared best actress honors last year at cannes . the poignancy and merits of the film , are in depicting accurately the reality of the girls' lives . it is a film without one false note of sympathy or sentimentality in it . this is not the type of a girl-buddy movie as seen in some hollywood films of late , filled with glibness and glitter and canned experiences . here , what happens has the ring of truth to it and is powerful in the sense that its simple telling of the tale , without trying to be cute or pedantic , turns out to be profound . this debut film for the 42-year-old director , done with the austerity of a master , reminiscent of someone like a robert bresson , is a work of considerable merit . it is a film that not only depicted the shattering of a friendship and a realistic look at life for the working class , but it probed into the deep seated loneliness found within each of the girls , looking at it in a poetic way . 
1	sudden death is a jean claude van damme action film . if you feel like a die hard ii type of movie and are ready to switch your brain to autopilot , this movie will provide an acceptable time at the bijou . sometimes after a hard week at work , you want a little fast paced albeit highly implausible compendium of chases and shoot 'em ups . it's the seventh game of the stanley cup playoffs . think about the title , and you can write most of the rest of the movie yourself without gene quintano's simplistic script . the director ( peter hyams ) has a spartan approach that sticks to action ( read killing ) without much worry about plausibility . i never realized how many ways there are to kill people in a kitchen . the lines are broadly written and sometimes funny . the pacing by editor steven kemper is clean and crisp . this movie is pure escapism and action scenes . think of it as die hard ii crossed with black sunday . if that is what you want , you could worse that sudden death . not particularly original , but funny nevertheless . i find jean claude van damme a strange actor . he does not have the charisma of a steven seagal or the energy of a bruce lee and yet his low key approach to killing bad guys holds a certain fascination no matter how ridiculous . powers boothe is always good as an evil figure and here he gives his standard performance . the best scene of all , and one worthy of a much higher quality movie , is the one where van damme gets to suit up and go on the ice . it is wonderful . it is rated r for massive violence which sometimes makes you squeamish but more often is more cartoonish than anything . after you see scores of people killed with little small bullet holes in the head , it becomes more unreal than frightening . i think the show is acceptable for teenagers if they are mature . i can not bring myself to recommend sudden death , but it did provide a nice diversion albeit a totally forgettable one . i give the film * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	most sports commentators thought ali had no chance to win and could be hurt badly . no this isn't another rocky movie , this is real life . yes , i know you may hate boxing as much as i do , but it does not matter . this fight was more an entertainment extravaganza than a sporting event . besides , leon gast's documentary skills turn what was , according to the press kit , 300 , 000 feet of film into a compelling picture even for those of us who have no interest in sports . it worked . the story had extra meaning for me since i once met muhammad ali when i was in college in the late 60s . the only thing i remember is that his fists were the size of small boulders . i recall seeing them and thinking , " oh , my god . " the film amply demonstrates that foreman was even larger and much more powerful than ali ever was . ali is certainly one of the most interesting sports figures of this century . he brought an energy and a poetic approach to boxing that was unique . you probably remember his many poems with " fly like a butterfly , sting like a bee " being his most famous , but george plimpton claims one poetry world record for ali . he thought a minute and replied , " me whee . " plimpton claims that is even shorter than the one " the guinness book of world records " has listed as the shortest , " jesus wept . " he was full of energy and high spirits . as he so aptly put it then , " i'm young ; i'm handsome ; i'm pretty and i can't possibly be beat . " he was so resolutely confident and gregarious that he was an inspiration to kids . the show pulsates with energy thanks to the music . many of the great entertainers of that era from james brown to b . b . king went to zaire to see the bout . some of the interviews are contemporary to the fight and others are more recent . the film is full of surprises from the training to the fight itself , but getting to know the legendary ali is worth the price of the movie ticket . no one before or since has ever been like him . certainly , boxing was never more fun than when he was around . leon gast's ability as a filmmaker is perhaps best demonstrated when he manages to make the strategy and the execution of the fight both lucid and interesting . one tidbit that i found fascinating was the time of the big event , three o'clock in the morning . an upbeat , absorbing film that kept my eyes riveted to the screen . after the press screening , i talked with some of the people there . most were in shock , like i , that someone could take boxing and make it so intriguing for those of us who abhor the sport . of course , the best documentarians can do exactly that whether the subject is insects ( microcosmos ) , obscure musical instruments ( theremin : an electronic odyssey ) or blood sports . i left the screening feeling exhilarated after having vicarious shared some time with an athletic legend and utterly fascinating character . it was not rated at the time of the screening , but i would guess it to be pg-13 . there is brief nudity , but no sex or profanity . the boxing sequences are not gory , but boxing is inherently violent . i think the movie would be fine for kids say nine and up . i recommend it to you and give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	day for night is a marvelous celebration of the art and toil of filmmaking . for those interested in the mechanics and the background of the creation of movies this picture should be on your must-see list . day for night won the oscar for best foreign film in 1973 and received nominations for best director and screenwriter for francois truffaut and best supporting actress for valentina cortese . with an excellent print , the film is showing now in manhattan . hopefully , the print will make its way around the country so others can share the joy i had in seeing it . the english title day for night for the french film le nuit americaine comes from the way filmmakers can shoot nighttime scenes during the day and then darken them in the developing to look like night . the title is apt in that the fascination of the picture comes from the behind the scenes look we get at the way pictures are made . a two hour documentary would not reveal less and certainly would not be as involving as day for night . we see all of the details , large and small . the actors step over the camera rails as they are being filmed and are careful not to trip . we watch them acting from facades and observe the director and the editor pouring over the day's film stock . like real movie making , the production of meet pamela has a slew of problems , which puts the director's 7-week schedule in jeopardy at every turn . the lab destroys a complicated and costly crowd scene . still , little that happens , except the ending , is a surprise . the masterwork of the movie is that truffaut makes both day for night and the cheap melodrama meet pamela fascinating without tricks or gimmicks . but the picture is no boring pseudo-documentary . the actors come alive with enough mini-dramas for a couple of daytime soap operas . valentina cortese plays the older actress severine , who drinks too much and forgets her lines as pamela's mother-in-law . jean-pierre leaud plays the impetuous young actor alphonse , who is in love with bisset in both pictures -- who wouldn't be ! if you've never quite understood how romances on movie sets develop , this movie demonstrates how quite convincingly . in a revelation of the duality of an actor's real and celluloid lives , julie and pamela come to the same conclusion . " i know that life is rotten . " although written a quarter of a century ago , the film seems remarkably fresh and relevant . the director complains that , " the godfather is showing all over nice , and it's killing the other movies . " with this summer's action blockbusters taking over most of the screens this comment becomes so apropos . the film is in french with english subtitles . it is rated pg for mild profanity and for sexuality . the film would be fine for teenagers and those a bit younger . i loved this sweet film and think you would too , so it gets a strong recommendation from me and * * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	actually , it isn't a western per se , but more of a modern-day fairy tale . certainly , a great deal of what happens is beyond the realm of reality and requires a willing suspension of disbelief . director mike newell perhaps put it best when he said , " there are certain things that happen in the film that cannot happen unless the world is a very odd , mysterious , and unreal sort of place . " in typical fairy tale fashion , there's a clear delineation between who the audience is supposed to sympathize with and who they aren't . at the end , the good guys are rewarded and the bad guys get their comeuppance , so those who don't like happy endings might be galled by into the west's final moments . then again , newell isn't known for doing downbeat projects . the juxtaposition of reality and fantasy somehow doesn't gel perfectly . the blending of the two is not seamless , and this sometimes makes the story's progression feel forced and unnatural . also , for most of the movie , i was wondering if there was a point to all of this . ultimately , there is--and a very telling one at that--but you have to wait the entire picture to discover it . the two young actors who play tito and ossie are excellent with expressions and actions , but young ciaran fitzgerald has trouble delivering believable dialogue . occasionally , his lines seem stilted and learned , rather than spontaneous . into the west has its heart in the right place , even if frequently defies logic . the movie is not nearly as endearing as newell's previous film , enchanted april , nor is it as poignant as screenwriter jim sheridan's my left foot , but it has its moments , and is definitely suitable for all but the youngest of children . like the secret garden , it has moments to captivate adults as well , even if it lacks some of the emotional depth and serene beauty of that film . this is a nice family adventure--certainly not a great movie , but a solid one . 
0	in this less than routine thriller , the cops and a philanthropist are the bad guys . it adds nothing to the situation . every character was one-dimensional , the story line was crass , the directing was more suited for a tv show than a feature film , the acting was stiff , and the cinematography was unimaginative . i can't think of one thing i liked about the film . 
0	cast : george clooney , arnold schwarzenegger , chris o'donnell , uma thurman , alicia silverstone , michael gough , pat hingle , elle macpherson , john glover , jeep swenson director : joel schumacher producer : peter macgregor-scott screenplay : akiva goldsman , based on characters created by bob kane cinematography : stephen goldblatt music : elliott goldenthal u . s . distributor : warner brothers with batman and robin , the fourth entry in the recent batman movie series , the profitable franchise appears poised to take a nosedive . this film , which places yet another actor in the batsuit , has all the necessary hallmarks of a sorry sequel -- pointless , plodding plotting ; asinine action ; clueless , comatose characterization ; and dumb dialogue . sadly for all the batfans who have been waiting with baited breath for this one , batman and robin has become the latest blight on the long summer movie season . fetishists will probably love batman and robin . it all goes nicely with the film's attempt at sensory overload . director joel schumacher has taken tim burton's dark vision of gotham city and shifted it into overdrive . this is a weird , wild , wacky world where gothic skyscrapers reach like twisted fingers into the clouds , and where the batsignal shines brighter than the moon . however , like the movie as a whole , this aspect is as briefly captivating as it is hollow and soulless . it quickly becomes clear that the picture's lone selling point is that it looks great , but , in an era when blockbuster budgets are routinely topping $100 million , that's no longer special . never has batman been less believable or human . it's not actor george clooney's fault -- he gives it a game try , but , really , his function is to provide a body to put into the costume . we see even less of bruce wayne's heart than we do of his face . gradually , over the previous three movies , bits and pieces of batman's character began to surface . not so here . all attempts at development are obligatory , perfunctory , and not terribly convincing . in the previous batman movies , the villains took center stage . now , arnold schwarzenegger and uma thurman add mr . freeze and poison ivy to the roster . these are the two least-interesting bad guys to date . meanwhile , thurman manages to do a pale imitation of carrey . her character is essentially a female representation of the riddler ( scientific experiments gone awry give a mentally-unstable nerd extraordinary powers ) , only far less engaging . his fate is rather pathetic , which proves that it doesn't pay to be the henchman in a movie like this . there's actually a poignant story behind freeze . the forces driving him are , therefore , incredibly complex -- too complex for schwarzenegger to convey effectively ( wasn't there a point when patrick stewart was being mentioned for this role ? ) or for schumacher to care about exploring . as a result , mr . freeze ends up being a frustratingly incomplete brute who's out to smother gotham city under a blanket of ice . at times , batman and robin comes close to matching the tone of the '60s tv series . only two things are missing : the on-screen cartoon captions ( " pow ! " meanwhile , anyone who comes to batman and robin expecting great action sequences will be disappointed . the fight scenes aren't interesting -- they're poorly choreographed , badly edited , and interrupted by too many one-liners . the " hockey team from hell " sequence is a perfect example : it seems to go on forever , but we're never really sure exactly what's happening ( or why it's happening , for that matter ) . batman and robin moves at a dizzying pace , yet goes absolutely nowhere . somewhere between the quarter and mid-point of this film , things turn repetitious and tedious . we see basically the same fight scene re-enacted three or four times -- and it isn't all that impressive on the first occasion . we become numb to the glitz and glamour , but , looking beyond it , we see only a vacuum . in trying to put the " comic " back into " comic book " , schumacher has reduced batman to the equivalent of a daily newspaper strip -- disjointed and painfully shallow . the character probably deserves more respect , but , in batman and robin , he doesn't get it . and , for that matter , neither does the audience . 
2	perhaps you have the same reaction to documentaries that i do . in general , they aren't my favorite type of movie , and it's usually only with a degree of reluctance that i see even a highly praised member of the genre . despite my misgivings , however , i almost always come away educated and intrigued , provided , of course , that the film maker has a clear idea of what he or she is doing . and , in the case of errol morris , the man who made one of the best-ever documentaries ( the thin blue line ) , the strength of presentation couldn't be more apparent . fast , cheap & out of control isn't much like any of morris' other well-known films -- gates of heaven ( about a pet cemetery ) , the thin blue line ( about a murder ) , and a brief history of time ( about science , space , and infinity ) . in fact , at first glance , this movie appears startlingly unambitious by comparison -- the kind of project one might encounter any night on pbs or the discovery channel . but there's more to fast , cheap & out of control than initially meets the eye . not only is there a great deal of craft involved in the film's production , but its underlying themes are compelling and universal . the basic framework for fast , cheap & out of control has morris interviewing four men with unique , but not terribly interesting , professions . all four of these individuals are among the best in their respective fields , and it's their passion for their jobs , rather than anything especially startling or hypnotic about the work itself , that piques our interest . as we watch , however , we become aware that , by structuring fast , cheap & out of control as he does , morris is doing far more than merely presenting a series of talking-head interviews . by piecing the film together with fast cuts and sequences where the soundtrack of one interview overlaps images depicting the activities of another of the subjects , morris explores at least two intriguing , interrelated themes : the evolution of humankind and our never-ending attempt to control our environment . contrast is a critical element . shaped by an ever-changing cultural and technical climate , jobs , like people , evolve . by telling all four stories , morris gives us a sense of what will be lost and what may be gained as time moves on . fast , cheap & out of control functions as a requiem for the past and a nod to the future . and even the mild-mannered mendonca alters the course of nature by twisting and shaping bushes into works of art . still , if you're a reluctant documentary-goer like me , there's probably only one question that you want answered : what's so special about a movie than interviews a no-name lion tamer , a no-name hedge trimmer , a no-name vermin photographer ( with a funny bow-tie ) , and a no- name robot scientist ? the answer , simply and succinctly , is errol morris , who has the talent to give meaning to even the most apparently- mundane material . spending time with the four subjects of fast , cheap & out of control isn't just an opportunity to learn about what they do , but , surprisingly , a chance to understand a little more about our place in the universe .

1	screenplay : peter greenaway . producers : kees kasander . director : peter greenaway . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 120 minutes . in 8-1/2 women , peter greenaway makes a film , and several completely nude men and women appear . . . but i repeat myself . greenaway's sensibilities have never shied away from provocative issues or images , specifically where the human body is concerned . yes indeed , peter greenaway loves putting naked people on the screen . in 8-1/2 women , lead actor john standing's genitalia get so much screen time , they probably should have gotten third billing in the credits . the question with greenaway has always been whether there is much to his exercises in conspicuous kink besides the conspicuous kink itself . by the time 8-1/2 women winds to its conclusion , it's hard to imagine a sexual fetish or taboo that's been left unexplored or undiscussed . there's even the ghastly sight of amanda plummer in neck brace and the kind of garish make-up usually associated with the emcee in cabaret . don't mistake this , however , for a film designed to arouse anything but curiosity . the episodes appear and disappear as though the whole enterprise were simply a fashion show for perversity , with scarcely a hint of eroticism to get in the way . as flesh-baring free-for-alls go , this one is pretty flaccid stuff . in a way , however , that absence of sexual intensity is what the film is all about . in a reflexive gag based on a reflexive film , greenaway has his two main characters comment on fellini's 8-1/2 , with philip wondering " how many film-makers . . . make films simply to act out their sexual fantasies , " to which storey replies , " all of them , i suppose . " in his typically skewed fashion , greenaway has made an intentionally un-titillating cautionary tale . if only greenaway's films felt as much like stories of real people as they felt like lessons . there's no question that greenaway is a superb film stylist ; he crafts powerful compositions like the interchanging medium- and close-range shot of the father and son conversing by the indoor pool , ripples reflecting off the walls . his films too often lack real emotional resonance , however , and 8-1/2 women is no exception . there are isolated moments when philip's grief seems more central to the story than the director's aesthetics , and there's a surprisingly funny scene in which one female servant discusses her failed " try-out " for the harem with a co-worker . more often , 8-1/2 women is another case of greenaway giving his audience lots to look at , a bit less to think about and virtually nothing to feel . he's a maker of intriguing but only fitfully satisfying films that happen to include lots of penises and breasts . he may be cinema's foremost purveyor of art-core porn . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	color of a brisk and leaping day won a deserved cinematography award at the 1996 sundance film festival . this movie , shot in black- and-white , makes brilliant use of grays and shadows to create a tapestry of unparalleled visual impact . unfortunately , the tale unfolded by these images is both pedestrian and incomplete , with a number of frustrating narrative holes that writer/director christopher munch feels no need to plug . but even his enthusiasm can't stop the inevitable . although the main storyline concentrates on the railroad , color of a brisk and leaping day is more about lee's awakening . despite a certain thematic richness , color of a brisk and leaping day has a multitude of problems . in fact , there's virtually no interpersonal interaction that exhibits any semblance of emotional depth . characters come and go with frustrating irregularity . we never have much of a feeling for anyone except lee , and he's such a cold fish that his supposed passion for the railroad is never effectively conveyed . the film is a visual marvel , especially considering its meager budget . archive footage is blended seamlessly with new material , making it seem like munch had a lot more money to work with . ultimately , however , it's difficulty for me to summon up much enthusiasm for this picture . if you search hard enough , good cinematography isn't that difficult to come by ; good stories are . color of a brisk and leaping day has the former , but not the latter .

2	starring : kristin scott-thomas , claudiu bleont , marcel iures director : lucian pintilie producer : lucian pintilie screenplay : lucian pintilie cinematography : calin ghibu music : anton suteu released by mk2 productions in romanian , french , and english with subtitles an unforgettable summer doesn't have the same stylish photography or non-chronological narrative , and it takes place in 1925 rather than in the present-day , but both films address the tragic results when intolerance ( tribal or racial ) and political expediency take precedence over simple , human compassion . the story underlying an unforgettable summer is simple and stark . not so straightforward are the questions of conscience posed by lucian pintilie's script . the basic impotence of the characters only emphasizes the real-world difficulties faced by peacemakers . it's seductively easy to kill a bunch of scapegoats and conveniently sweep any dissidents under the nearest rug . despite a fine performance by british actress kristin scott-thomas ( best known for the role of fiona in four weddings and a funeral , and displaying trilingual abilities here ) , her character doesn't have much real depth , and that's one of an unforgettable summer's glaring weaknesses . in fact , as tenuous as the audience's connection is to marie-therese , it's even less certain where petre is concerned . at times , the captain is too cold and distant to court favor from any viewer . an unforgettable summer is getting very limited distribution , but for those who have an opportunity to see it , the movie makes an excellent companion piece to before the rain . 
1	cast : paul newman , susan sarandon , gene hackman , james garner , stockard channing , reese witherspoon , giancarlo esposito director : robert benton producers : arlene donovan , scott rudin screenplay : robert benton & richard russo cinematography : piotr sobocinski music : elmer bernstein u . s . distributor : paramount pictures twilight may end up being the most disappointing film of 1998 . it certainly holds that distinction to date , but i'm aware that there are ten months left in the year . and let me emphasize that by " disappointing , " i mean something that falls drastically short of my expectations . that's different from " bad , " which twilight certainly isn't . there are pleasures to be found within , but this movie never comes close to living up to its potential . look at the talent involved in twilight . the supporting cast includes the always reliable james garner , stockard channing , and m . emmet walsh , not to mention up-and-coming actress reese witherspoon . the director , robert benton , has written and helmed such efforts as nobody's fool and kramer vs . kramer . the cinematographer , polish-born piotr sobocinski , was one of kieslowski's favorite collaborators , and did the photography for red . considering all of this , it's no wonder that i had high expectations for twilight -- expectations it didn't come close to fulfilling . the problem is the script , which could charitably be called unspectacular . this is a b-movie screenplay with an a-level cast and crew . ultimately , no matter how talented the people making the film are , there's a limit to what they can do with a plot this contrived and predictable . true , the high level of acting and rich , noir atmosphere keep viewers intrigued and involved , but , when the final credits start to roll , there's a vague sense of dissatisfaction . the question foremost in my mind at that moment was " is that all there is ? " the only time twilight's screenplay truly shines is when it contemplates questions of age and mortality . normally , mystery/thrillers have younger , stronger protagonists -- not white- haired retirees who have to worry about prostate problems . if nothing else , twilight captures a slice of the melancholia associated with growing old . emmet walsh ) -- only this guy has blood leaking from several bullet holes in his body . twilight is classic potboiler stuff , and it's easy to figure out how things are going to turn out in the end . the few twists and surprises are obvious and the seams are visible in the pedestrian screenplay . still , although the story isn't likely to stave off boredom , newman's acting accomplishes that . this isn't the actor's best work , but , even not in peak form , he is adept enough at his craft to create an engaging personality . sarandon is a wonderfully mature-yet-sultry femme fatale , garner is enjoyable as one of harry's old friends , and witherspoon is fresh and sexy . the only one who rubbed me the wrong way is giancarlo esposito , who plays a fatuous would-be sidekick . twilight drips atmosphere . even though it's a contemporary tale , it has the feel of something set forty or fifty years ago . but stylistic photography and solid acting aren't everything , and there are only so many plot imperfections such assets can mask . twilight should have been a better movie . it's rare that this much talent is assembled for a single production , and it seems criminal to waste it in this manner . with a lesser cast , the film would have been easy to shrug off . but with this bunch , although the final product is undeniably better than it would have been with a group of secondary performers , the aftertaste is vaguely bitter . " my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . " -- david puttnam 
2	bruce willis , one of our most uneven actors , gives a terrific performance this time as that shadowy figure known as the jackal . at first even the fbi is not sure whether the jackal is a real person or just a myth . with a new identity and look every five minutes in the picture , it is no wonder that the jackal has remained so elusive . although the new movie the jackal by rob roy's director michael caton-jones acknowledges kenneth roth's screenplay for the day of the jackal in the credits , it shares little of the story . as the sincere ex-ira hit man named declan mulqueen , richard gere manages to keep his irish accent consistent and believable . although gere slightly underplays an already underwritten role , he gives a quite credible performance . the problems with the movie almost undermine it on several occasions . the script heaps several unnecessary leaps of faith on the audience , most surrounding the lack of seriousness american law enforcement officers place on the threat of a major assassination . more than once , when a place should be crawling with cops , mulqueen has to go mano a mano with the jackal . and the well executed ending is flawed by an illogical rabbit pulled out of a hat . the director does not get the show's motor in gear for over half an hour . after he does , he lets it slip into neutral too often in the non-action scenes . in most thrillers , consider the television " prime suspect " dramas , for example , the police's planning scenes are full of tension and energy . in the jackal , by contrast , there is a certain ennui to the proceedings . all of this notwithstanding , whenever willis is on the screen , the movie hums . the writing is smart in the way the jackal creates his disguises and switches back and forth seamlessly . even though the assassination attempt is telegraphed from early on , its execution will undoubtedly send chills up your spine . at the jackal's best , as it is in the last half hour , the movie has you on the edge of your seat . the problem with the film is that too often you may find yourself slumped back in your chair during the frequent slow interludes . it is rated r for some profanity and a few gory scenes . it would be fine for teenagers . 
1	so far , the lineup goes three deep . grisham's novels all have a depressing sameness to them , and this one is no different . we have the young , good looking hero crusading for right . whether he wins or not isn't important , only that he gives it his best shot and , in doing so , redeems himself . this isn't just the plot of the chamber , it's the plot of the firm and a time to kill . and , if you do a little gender-swapping , it's also the plot of the pelican brief . frankly , when you get down to it , the client isn't all that different , either . these are the " grisham men " -- the good-looking , young actors who play basically the same hero . so why does a young hotshot like adam take such a hopeless case ? as i indicated earlier , the chamber isn't so much about getting sam off as it is about adam exorcising his personal ghosts . this isn't a deep or intelligent examination of either -- it's a blatant attempt to push viewers' buttons , relying on speeches and melodrama to replace an honest , more powerful form of emoting . too often , dialogue in this film is people talking at one another , rather than to one another . there's an inherent danger in the way the chamber addresses its serious subject matter -- one that was apparent , but less blatant , in the most recent grisham adaptation , a time to kill . it's all part of the grisham formula : present facile , " tabloid " examinations of controversial issues . the danger arrives if members of the audience start mistaking grisham's simplistic views as thoughtful presentations rather than devices to move the plot along and get us to sympathize with the protagonist . plot-wise , the chamber is full of seeming irrelevancies . the movie should have been streamlined better ; there's no need to try to include virtually every character from the book . some of them , like lela rochon's nora stark , could have been cut out with little loss . grisham likes defining characters as " good " or " evil " , which is why playing the racism card is such a cop-out : by definition , racists are bad -- and most of them presented here are downright monstrous . the exception is cayhall , who we learn may not be guilty at all . grisham allows sam to be painted with shades of gray , and , not surprisingly , he becomes the most interesting character in the film . of course , that could also have something to do with the passionate portrayal given by gene hackman , who comes across as the cream of the crop even in a john grisham movie . chris o'donnell , on the other hand , is flat , and his character is dull . we're supposed to be identifying with this guy , but he fails to grab our attention , let alone our imagination . when it comes to the actual death row scenes , the chamber is especially weak . even last dance was more impressive . there's no emotional power here , and , most importantly , no catharsis . the end of dead man walking put everyone in the audience through an emotional and ethical ringer , and there weren't many dry eyes in the house . the chamber , on the other hand , is mechanical and artificial , and tells you what to think . if anyone was crying at my showing , they hid it well . ultimately , of course , that's the problem with grisham -- he presents shallow , modern-day pulp fiction , so , when he pretends to deal with serious issues , it's all a thinly-disguised masquerade . -- ingmar bergman

0	what's the worst that could happen ? well , you could be watching freddie got fingered , the worst movie of the year and perhaps the decade , rather than what's the worst that could happen ? the latter , while it isn't particularly funny , may not even be the worst comedy of the week . his previous 2 films , drowning mona and the aptly named screwed , were perfectly awful . ) max feels no guilt since kevin has just robbed one of max's mansions . typical of the story's gags is kevin's inability to tell a lie without blinking . sam weisman ( the out-of-towners ) , who directs with ham handed obviousness , has lawrence exaggerate his blinking like a stage actor who needs to make sure that even those audience members way back in the cheap seats can still see his gestures . just in case the visuals aren't enough to have you in stitches , the dogs turn out to have a major flatulence problem . this juvenile comedy , with its recycled humor that seems always aimed squarely at kids around 12 or so , does have one truly funny scene . the television camera bleeps it all out , but the sign language translator relishes her big opportunity to ad lib with some obvious but nonetheless hilarious gestures . what's the worst that could happen ? it is rated pg-13 for language and sexual content and would be acceptable for kids around 8 and up . my son jeffrey , age 12 , thought the picture was really funny and gave it * * * 1/2 . in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
0	a spaghetti western that can't be ruined by poor dubbing , an outlandishly gross tale , dialogue that is meaningless , acting that's the pits , a body count for enemies that would satisfy the pentagon during the entire vietnam war , an acrobat who annoyingly can't stop doing flips , an obnoxious strolling banjo player with a rifle hidden in its neck , a drunk knife-thrower , one-dimensional villains , and an assortment of nonsensical gun duels . this film is so bad , so lacking in humor and romance , or any possible relation to reality , yet it is still mindlessly entertaining . there's a lot of spaghetti tossed about in this conventional hollywood looking plot but , nevertheless , typical italian action western . it's not for all tastes , even those who like westerns might not care for the amoral personification of the lee van cleef character . but you can't beat this film for continuous gunfights and mounting body counts . this is the first of a trilogy about sabata . 
1	martha and i , a tale about living in the sudeten region of czechoslovakia at the dawn of nazi occupation , is a confused motion picture that doesn't know whether it wants to be a coming-of-age story , an offbeat romance , or a statement against prejudice . although poorly edited with a jumpy narrative , martha and i has a number of affecting moments , but the film doesn't tell enough of any of its three stories for the conclusion , which weaves them together , to have much impact . martha and i opens as a coming-of-age drama following the adolescent exploits of emil as he learns about sex , violence , and life . these sequences , directed with all the authenticity of someone recalling his own childhood , work well , exposing the uncertainties of this troubled time through the eyes of a boy . however , somewhat inexplicably , film maker jiri weiss shifts not only the focus of the story , but the point-of-view as well . one of the reasons martha and i often fails to hit the right notes is that it skips around . with the exception of the three principals , none of the characters is more than half-developed . also , while the plight of the jews under hitler's anti-semitic onslaught is never trivialized , it is presented in an insulated context . it's never clear who the " i " is in martha and i , and that's a central problem . if it's ernst , why is the first half of the film told from emil's point-of-view , and why is he employed as the narrator ? and if it's emil , why does his character fade into obscurity just when his story is really beginning to interest us ? martha and i might have been more successful if developed as two separate films . in this configuration , it never finds the stable tone necessary to draw the audience in . the result is a picture more interesting for its historical perspective than for the plight of its characters . 
1	in nicole garcia's place vend ? me , catherine deneuve delivers an exquisitely underplayed and delicately nuanced performance as the alcoholic marianne . the problem in a nutshell is that her acting is the only reason to see the movie . much is made of marianne's illness . she still drinks all of the time , but , since she doesn't guzzle it down , she no longer shows signs of drunkenness . laurent dailland's cinematography is heavy on the dark atmospherics with a muted color palette that accentuates the drab grays . he likes nothing better than to give us such hazy , underlit scenes that you wonder if there is a brownout . and the director sets such a languid pace that if a character fired a gun , the bullet would take a full two minutes to strike its victim . the biggest cheat is that place vend ? me is the type of story in which you wait in vain for something to finally happen . watching deneuve at work is a treat , but it isn't enough . place vend ? me runs 1 : 57 . the film is in french with english subtitles . it is not rated but would probably be an r for brief violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers . 
0	there are two premises to the film . the other , amazingly enough , is just the opposite , and the film depicts almost all of the dogs as representing a vast criminal underclass of society . i found these two notions as incongruous and baffling . the bigger problem with the movie however is that there is only one sympathetic character in it , the little human girl anne-marie ( judith barsi who was great as ducky in the land before time ) , and the dogs are universally unlovable ! none of the dogs are characters that the audience cares about . burt reynolds provides one of the most bland readings , and i do mean reading , of a script in a long time . judith barsi provides a great voice for anne-marie , and the only reason to view this show about dogs is to see this wonderfully sweet and innocent human girl , which , of course , makes no sense at all . in fact , the whole anne-marie character is adorable , which leads me to the most distasteful aspect of the picture . maybe i am being way too sensitive , but i kept seeing carface as being created as too close to a pedophile . oh well , this was not the main reason i did not like the show . the main reason was that it is boring and holds no interest whatsoever , other than the character of the only human lead , anne-marie . the weak script by david weiss , et . al . , has very few memorable lines , and charlie gets most of them . his lame attempts at humor include , " some of the poorest people i know are as broke as the ten commandments . " other than the anne-maria character , the only other part with any merit are the drawings . they are a cornucopia of oversaturated colors . the songs written by t . j . kuenster and charles strouse are as bland as bland can be , but the singing by charlie is even worse . it is so bad that is hard to call it singing . you are probably more melodious . all dogs go to heaven drags on at 1 : 29 . in fact , if the producer had just gotten a whole new set of dogs , it would have been a much more enjoyable film . the show is rated g , but i wonder if pg would not have been more appropriate in a show where characters get shot at with a machine gun and where one goes on a scary dream journey to the deeps of hell . at any rate , i would be careful with little kids and these scenes . i can not recommend the film although jeffrey ( almost 7 ) seemed to like it , and i give it a single * for judith barsi's anne-marie . i hope the recently released all dogs go to heaven 2 is better since jeffrey wants to see it . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	this sporadically funny movie's limitations start with the casting and the costuming . there are over a dozen characters in this shoot-and-steal tale , but they can be easily collected into three groups . there are the tall , thin , young white guys , the beefy , middle-aged , white guys , and the mustached , young black guys . the script doesn't do much to differentiate the characters within the three groups . the storyline bounces around like a leaf in the wind . although there are several funny episodes , the picture as a whole never quite gels . if the dialog , mumbled with thick accents , has trouble carrying the movie , the atmospherics are dead-on . filmed by tim maurice-jones with a gritty , dimly lit , sepia-toned look , the movie employs a wide variety of techniques from still pictures to slow motion to fast action . iain andrews's sets are full of convincingly low-rent buildings . the film has several nice small touches . this is the sort of movie in which a stranger in flames comes running out of a bar . he is never seen again , and why he was torched is never quite explained . to the director's credit , he has the good sense to take a serious approach to his bizarre little , dark comedy . scored to loud electric guitar music , the movie is as confidently presented as it is confusing . subplots abound , and since the actors look so much alike , it is frequently unclear whose side each is on . although it ends in a quentin tarantino-style hail of violence , the movie has firmly established british roots . lock , stock & two smoking barrels runs 1 : 46 . it is rated r for strong violence , pervasive profanity , sexuality and drug content and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
1	director : scott hicks . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( sexual situations , adult themes , violence , profanity ) running time : 127 minutes . several months ago , upon hearing that david guterson's much-respected novel _snow falling on cedars_ was being turned into a film , i made my usual effort to familiarize myself with the source material . after approximately 90 pages , i did something i almost never do : i surrendered . the grinding pacing of the story -- which , at the point i lost interest , had consisted almost entirely of a court proceeding -- did absolutely nothing to motivate persistence . whatever intriguing themes might have been contained in guterson's tale would never be known to me thanks to a narrative decision i considered crippling : waiting far too long to get to the point . this background is offered to make it clear that my ambivalence towards scott hicks' snow falling on cedars has nothing to do with affection for the source material . it also sets up the problem with the film , which is the same problem i had with the novel . it's not the first time the screen has seen a story of lovers separated by the japanese-american internment camps ( alan parker fumbled the similarly-themed come see the paradise ) , but that doesn't mean it's not an important story to tell . in fact , snow falling on cedars has an angle on the often-didactic issue of racism that makes it potentially compelling . those feelings , however , are not some easily dismissable bigotry . unfortunately , by the time it's clear how hicks and co-screenwriter ron bass are trying to personalize the murky matter of racism , the film is almost over . that leaves a film with two glaring flaws . the first is ethan hawke's performance as ishmael , which is so blank that the role might just as easily have been played by a cardboard cutout . hicks does a nice job with ishmael and hatsue's secretive adolescent trysts inside a hollow tree , but he doesn't do much to help us understand ishmael's longing . hawke plays most of his scenes with a thousand-yard stare we're expected to interpret as a combination of introspection and repressed emotion , while it could just as easily be interpreted as trying to remember where he left his car keys . by the time hicks tries to crank up the drama by cranking up james newton howard's score during a wildly overwrought sequence involving hatsue's " dear john " letter , it's too late to give the relationship the sense of consequence it demands . the second problem is the directorial self-indulgence exemplified by that " dear john " sequence , which shows up at every possible wrong time . there's too much film-making business going on for too long , and too little of the human story that should intensify the historical story . i didn't surrender on the film version of snow falling on cedars . i merely walked out unsatisfied , wondering why the story , like bad journalism , had to bury the lead . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	it's too bad the title the good , the bad , and the ugly was already taken , because it would have been the perfect moniker for fear and loathing in las vegas , terry gilliam's adaptation of hunter s . thompson's book ( emphasis on " the bad and the ugly " part ) . it's always a risky endeavor to fashion a motion picture based on an " unfilmable " novel -- even to try demands a director with a lion's share of chutzpah . gilliam , the american member of the monty python troupe , certainly has that quality , but his efforts here have met with what can charitably be called mixed results . from time-to-time , fear and loathing in las vegas is darn funny , but those moments of seemingly-inspired humor are more than offset by the rest of the movie , which is nearly unwatchable . the film's plot is thin , but then the book , which is a stream-of- consciousness affair , is more interested in making pithy observations and developing a tone than in presenting a narrative . one thing gilliam does well is to capture thompson's style and unleash it on the screen . however , i'm not sure that's a good thing . after all , there is a reason why books are books and movies are movies , and fear and loathing in las vegas makes a pretty good case that the two don't always mix . i'm sure the idea of the film is to give the viewer the sense of inhabiting duke's shoes -- that's what all the weird angles , distorted shots , and red lighting are for . however , being in a theater watching a couple of wasted characters is not anything like being under the influence of a mind-altering drug ( or so i'm told ) . it doesn't take long for the movie-goer to recognize all of the visual trickery as a gimmick designed to camouflage the fact that the film doesn't go anywhere : the plot is repetitious and the protagonist is a lifeless caricature . in this picture , the narrator has more lines than the characters . this is one of those rare movies when the technique of having a narrator works , primarily because every amusing or insightful comment made during the far-too-long running length is contained in the voiceover . as one might expect , gilliam also takes a few corrosive shots at middle- class america . the most obvious of these occurs during the film's funniest sequence : an anti-drug " information session " attended by duke , gonzo , and dozens of white bread , out-of-uniform cops . as duke , depp gives a wonderful physical performance with no emotional depth . a loss of communication with the spinal column " ) , but doesn't give us any reason to care about duke . he's like steve martin in the jerk , only much , much less inspired . meanwhile , the most impressive thing about benicio del toro is how thoroughly he manages to hide his good looks beneath hair , rolls of fat , and drying bodily fluids . i'm not sure how anyone who has seen the film can make that statement , since the movie reduces chronic users to the level of barely-functional zombies awash in degeneracy . visually and viscerally , there is a connection between fear and loathing in las vegas and trainspotting , albeit with two critical differences : the british picture developed real characters and didn't go on and on and on , ad nauesum , like this one . while i'm not recommending the movie to anyone interested in either ( a ) mainstream entertainment , or ( b ) something with a coherent narrative , the film has the look and feel of a picture that's destined for cult status . it's the kind of movie that plays at midnight showings during film festivals and generates a small-but-devoted legion of fans who attend conventions and boast about how many hundreds of times they've watched it . " my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . " -- david puttnam 
1	selena enjoyed a phenomenal popularity among mexican-americans , and seemed poised to cross over to mainstream english-language success as well . well , after two hours and ten minutes of selena , i'm still not quite sure . there are plenty of details about selena's life , but no _story_ of her life . without a compelling narrative direction , selena becomes a polished and respectful feature film version of an a&e " biography . " nava tries to cover a lot of ground in selena , and one of the film's primary flaws is that it seems more interested in relating events than in giving those events any shape . there are a dozen minor conflicts strewn throughout selena , many of which could have been used to define what this film is about . there are even confusing gaps in the story-telling ( who were those guys who trashed chris's hotel room , anyway ? which make selena feel even more unfocused . selena generally feels most on-track when it captures her performances . the concert footage is somewhat over-dramatized , but jennifer lopez gives a charismatic performance as selena , lip-synching to the real selena's recordings while smiling a thousand-watt smile and radiating a genuine affection for her fans . nava tries to give her calling more weight -- selena says at one point that she feels " all the hopes and dreams " of her fans -- but mostly she just seems to be a born performer with an approachable personality . lopez has some very nice moments , as does the generally reliable olmos . his intensity , and the sense of responsibility he instills in selena as a mexican-american celebrity , give selena its greatest sense of purpose . even then , however , it still feels compromised by its unwillingness to dig very deeply . more to the point of the film , nava tells selena's story as though she should be a hero simply because she was a successful chicana . there are worse reasons to lionize someone than for being a good role model , and it is certainly a tragedy that a young woman died too soon , but the story of selena's life just doesn't make for a very compelling dramatic film . selena didn't need to be filled with dirt ; it just needed a reason for being besides providing a pleasant but unremarkable memorial to a pleasant but unremarkable singer . the well-made and well-acted selena will almost certainly satisfy selena's fans . those of us who didn't understand why she was so beloved may have to wait for the unauthorized biography . 
2	irma vep , olivier assayas' incisive and entertaining 1996 feature , takes an offbeat look at the current state of french cinema . cut from the same cloth as such recent american features as my life's in turnaround and living in oblivion , assayas turns the camera on the behind-the-scenes process , and the results are both comic and revealing ( although it should be noted that this film is not as openly jokey as the other two movies ) . in a picture that has a lot to say about the film making process and the people who engage in it , assayas has not restricted his commentary to the french movie industry -- he has words for the american and hong kong brands , as well . irma vep isn't lacking when it comes to a drawing card . the sight of actress maggie cheung ( supercop ) garbed in a skintight , black latex outfit should be enough to create lines at the box office ( it won't , but that's beside the point ) . and , out of some misplaced artistic sentiment , he has decided to honor the original by filming the new version as a silent , black-and-white offering that's more strange than it is compelling . when it comes to vidal's version , there are problems . once , in a fit of pique , he declares of the fetishist film , " it's not a game -- it's very important . " irma vep works extraordinarily well on two levels . it explores the movie-making process , and , in doing so , exposes the fakery and hypocrisy that often emerges in the self-serving , so-called " intellectual cinema . " one character states that many french movies have become boring because they're intended only for the elite , and that the tendency of french directors to embrace such limited projects is contributing to the death of the movie industry . it's an interesting theory , and one that stands in contrast to the belief that big-budget , mindless action films are responsible for the decline in the quality of american movies ( another subject that does not go unnoticed by irma vep ) . assayas has fun with this idea , and gets quite a bit of mileage playing off the commonly-held perception that french cinema is dull and talky . there's also a more serious point to this aspect of the movie , as it will prod viewers into considering what they look for and appreciate in a film , and whether the true strength of the medium lies in its variety and versatility . what really makes this project work , however , is its ability to create a believable group of characters . assayas uses the tricks of cinema verite -- handheld shots and long takes -- to good effect , as we immediately become involved in the lives of these people . it's a magical moment . are french films stuffy ? at times , yes , and that's one of many reasons why even the most " accessible " french movies are relegated to art cinemas in this country . irma vep gleefully defies such facile labeling , however . this is a sly , sexy endeavor that presents its audacious viewpoint with style and intelligence . irma vep features some wonderful performances ( notably those of cheung , leaud , and richard ) , that , in concert with its sure direction and smart script , make for a wholly satisfying motion picture . 
0	screenplay : andrew kevin walker and neal jimenez director : brett leonard . thriller-cum-horror films tend to come in two basic flavors . on one end you've got your high-school audience slasher film , one of those infinitely sequeled flicks based on a charismatic killer named freddy or chuckie or pinhead ; on the other end is your moody , upscale thriller , something that genuinely tries to be creepy and doesn't depend entirely on bursts of music or a cat leaping out at someone . there are about ten times as many of the former as the latter , and as a result i limit the films in the genre that i choose to see to those i have some moderate hope for . hideaway could have been one of the rare quality efforts , but instead of being ambitious , it's mostly just pretentious and gimmicky , and pretty dull besides . naturally , there are a few side effects : headaches , trouble sleeping and an unsettling tendency to see visions of murders . based on the novel by dean koontz , hideaway has some fairly promising psychological material at its core . these issues could have been utilized to make hideaway something more than standard issue supernatural horror fare , but director brett leonard refuses to let character matter . while not nearly as techno-happy as he was in his previous film the lawnmower man , leonard still makes hideaway too much about filtered shots ( used to simulate hatch's visions ) and some absurd computer- generated visions of the afterlife . at least the computer tricks are moderately interesting to look at . hideaway is mostly a big fat bore , full of performances which could politely be called somnabulistic . it often appears as though in between takes he was watching his own performance in the fly and wondering , " how did i do that ? " it is jeremy sisto who really deserves our pity , though . his teen psycho could have been fascinating and even sympathetic , but he is turned into a tiresome heavy-metal-listenin' , sunglasses-at-night-wearin' , virgin-sacrificin' , black-candle-lightin' , devil-worshippin' plot device . hideaway completely implodes with a preposterous climax which reduces the eternal battle between good and evil to a cool psychedelic light show , with a life-affirming vision from beyond thrown in for good measure . it is , however , merely the logical culmination of an incompetent directing job which can't even seem to do cliches right . hideaway is a good idea for a thriller ; if only it had been scary . or different . or * something * . 
1	starring : sharon stone , gene hackman , russell crowe , leonardo dicaprio director : sam raimi producers : joshua donen , allen shapiro , and patrick markey screenplay : simon moore cinematography : dante spinotti music : alan silvestri released by tristar pictures if movies were rated solely on the basis of style , the quick and the dead would score highly indeed . with its dazzling photography , inventive camera angles , and throbbing bass score , the film is an experience for the eyes and ears . director sam raimi ( darkman , army of darkness ) and cinematographer dante spinotti have woven a beautifully elaborate tapestry : colorful and evocative--and depressingly two-dimensional . the spaghetti western is not a genre that lends itself to great leaps of originality . even the best of this genre tend to follow fairly familiar patterns . the quick and the dead is no exception--indeed , it's so predictable that there's almost no opportunity for tension . raimi's choice to give the film a comic book-like aura of mingled camp and grit makes for some fitfully energetic and entertaining moments , but it's not enough to overcome the quick and the dead's primary fault . surprise isn't always necessary , of course , as long as there's a decent dramatic underpinning to the story . such was the case in clint eastwood's unforgiven . in the quick and the dead , however , we have sharon stone in the lead role and , while she's good at looking peeved and delivering deadpan one-liners , her emotional range is limited . during a scene where she's crying in a graveyard , it's difficult for those in the audience to avoid grimacing . at the outset , we don't know exactly why ( although it's possible to make a pretty good guess or two ) , but she's after john herod ( gene hackman ) , possibly the fastest gun around . gene hackman is , as usual , a joy to watch , even though he is essentially resurrecting a somewhat over-the-top version of little bill from unforgiven . leonardo dicaprio continues to show promise in a supporting role as herod's unloved offspring , and russell crowe gives the quick and the dead's best straight performance as a gunslinger-turned- preacher-turned-gunslinger-again . while these street duels are necessary staples of the western , this film has a few too many and , despite raimi's use of different angles and techniques , they get tiring long before the predictable , climactic showdown . all the nice " little " touches , such as the townspeople stripping corpses and a sight gag involving holes in bodies , don't make up for this repetition . the script just doesn't offer enough variety . there's a lot of movement in the quick and the dead , but it's usually a case of going nowhere fast . while the film is too slick and flashy to allow boredom , there's little in the way of substance . beneath the brightly-polished surface sheen , the quick and the dead shows a distressingly hollow interior--and that's an unfortunate epitaph for any film's tombstone . 
1	cast : indira varma , sarita choudhury , ramon tikaram , naveen andrews , rekha director : mira nair producers : mira nair , lydia dean pilcher screenplay : helena kriel and mira nair cinematography : declan quinn music : mychael danna u . s . distributor : trimark pictures a controversial film does not necessarily equate to a good film . this is true whether the movie is a big budget hollywood release ( showgirls ) or an art house special ( crash ) . and , while director mira nair's latest , kama sutra , isn't receiving the same kind of press accorded to david cronenberg's sex-and-accident-fest , it has still generated a great deal of censorship and certification wrangling . in the united states , trimark pictures , convinced that the film would be branded nc-17 , chose to release kama sutra unrated . in india , nair had to fight long and hard to avoid cutting 11 minutes of celluloid ( the eventual cuts numbered 2 1/2 minutes ) . in fact , that's only one aspect of the volume , which teaches lessons about the spiritual and material differences between sex with and without love . and , like the book from which it takes its name , nair's picture is only tangentially about positions . however , while nair ( salaam bombay ! , mississippi masala ) is attempting to strike a potentially-rich vein of thematic material , she unwisely chooses an overwrought , period melodrama as the means by which to explore it . kama sutra looks great -- it's sumptuously crafted with vibrantly colorful costumes and impeccable production values -- but there's a distressing lack of substance beneath the style . the movie has the basic narrative structure of a soap opera or a sudsy romance novel . the sex scenes , which are numerous ( although perhaps not numerous enough to satisfy those who are hoping for a soft-core art house experience ) , are actually kama sutra's most notable feature , not because of their controversial nature but because they display an almost-spiritual eroticism that few directors attempt to capture on film . the basic material comprising kama sutra isn't fundamentally bad -- it's a little silly and formulaic , but at least events keep the story moving . the real problem is that the tale is told from maya's point-of- view , and the actress in the lead role , newcomer indira varma , can't act . she's sensual and sexy , looks great both in and out of her costumes , and steams up the screen during the love scenes , but her dramatic range is nonexistent . her performance is so weak that we never accept maya as a character , and , without maya , kama sutra comes across as little more than an artsy harlequin paperback . there's no debating that nair skims some interesting aspects of the politics of sex , but none of these themes seem more than half-realized . kama sutra is a brave experiment , but " brave " , like " controversial , " doesn't mean " successful . " the film's interesting issues get trapped in the melodrama like insects in amber , and , no matter how hard they struggle to escape , they're ultimately smothered by kama sutra's clunky plot . 
2	the yellow-colored y rays are tolerable , but the new green-colored z rays are pretty sinister . so what is the story about ? it's a murder mystery with romulus as a blend of the lead characters of shine , " columbo , " and the fisher king . jackson avoids all of the pitfalls of such a role , delivering a performance that makes romulus a complex character who deserves our sympathy and our understanding . director kasi lemmons , whose only other film was the acclaimed eve's bayou , has an acute sense of the visual . romulus's many surrealist dream sequences are particularly compelling , giving us an enhanced awareness of his pain . the caveman's valentine doesn't quite fit into any category . it's a fairly thin mystery but a heck of a character study . whatever it is , it keeps your eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end . without jackson to play the central role , the production would have been hopeless . it is rated r for language , some violence and sexuality and would be acceptable for older teenagers . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
1	the original my girl was something of a mildly-entertaining , inoffensive motion picture that adequately blended light comedy with some occasionally-manipulative drama . the sequel retains not only the characters from its predecessor , but much of the same feel , as well . at its worst , my girl 2 is light on plot and heavy on 70s pop hits . at its best , the film is good-natured and occasionally touching . my girl 2 has its share of corny moments , too many of which occur around the climax , but these don't invalidate the movie's strengths . while not possessed of the most original storyline , the picture manages to make vada's quest mostly-believable , enabling the audience to actually care about how things turn out . even more than the first installment , this film focuses on vada . nick's otherwise superfluous presence gives vada a chance for a quick romance . phil is a weak character to begin with , so this subplot quickly becomes tedious . my girl 2 would have been enhanced , not diminished , by the deletion of those offending scenes . anna chlumsky , looking much more mature than previously , is still " rough around the edges " in her acting , but she gives a performance that's generally convincing . austin o'brien , last seen riding sidekick to arnold schwarzenegger in last action hero , is almost ms . chlumsky's match . my girl 2 is unlikely to win any awards , and its arrival on movie screens is relatively unheralded , but it provides a reasonably entertaining ninety-eight minutes . while the original concept didn't demand a continuation , this is a rare sequel that manages to do what it's supposed to--advance the story without becoming redundant . the film is undemanding of its audience , and those that enjoyed the first installment will likely be pleased by this one . 
1	screenplay : melvin van peebles . director : mario van peebles . i have often said that the first responsibility of a historically based film is not necessarily to be good history , but to be good drama . documented facts can sometimes make for a compelling story on their own , but usually a bit of creative license is not merely acceptable , it's required . so how can i say that out of one side of my mouth , while with the other i criticize panther for being a mediocre account of the rise of the black panther party ? because by painting the characters in a far too positive light , the filmmakers have robbed the characters of their humanity , and everything that might make them interesting . while there are a number of powerful images , panther is a one-note drama which misses the opportunity to include some internal conflict . mario van peebles is developing into a director with a real flair for powerful visuals , and panther is no exception . his use of documentary footage and different film stocks has a bit of oliver stone theatricality , but without the wretched excess . the early scenes of the panthers' emergence as a force have a tense energy . it is a vivid example of why the black panthers' message was so widely embraced , and why they became so powerful so quickly . what van peebles is unable to do is provide any real sense of who these men were , and the reason is one of intent . both screenwriter melvin and director mario are not particularly interested in creating characters , it seems ; they want to create idols . bobby seale is presented as a serene sort of philosopher- king , relegated to the background in favor of the more vocal huey newton . but even newton becomes little more than a figurehead , a mouthpiece for a message rather than a fully-realized man . there is a single scene of eldridge cleaver ( well-played by anthony griffith ) breaking ranks to take more forceful action , but with that exception the black panthers in panther come off as one collective consciousness . the absence of any real internal conflict makes panther become extremely derivative . the tenth or eleventh time , it has long since lost its sting . there are just too many scenes of sneering brutality which become interchangeable in a way i'm sure the van peebles' did not want . the addition of a government/mafia conspiracy to flood the black community with cheap drugs only emphasizes the fact that this is a story entirely about looking outward . the black panther story is an important part of an important time , but it could have had real power if panther had been more about the men behind the movement and less an exercise in hero worship . 
1	after seeing and being disappointed by the recent ( 1997 ) remake of that darn cat , we decided to go back and watch the original 1965 version starring hayley mills and dean jones . although dated , the original clearly outshines the remake . even the cat in the original possesses superior acting talent and a wider ranges of emotions . the book's authors as well as bill walsh are credited with writing the screenplay for the original . i have been told that the botched screenplay for the new version went through so many rewrites that the writers , s . m . alexander and l . a . karaszewski , tried to disassociate themselves from it . while no masterpiece , the script for the 1965 film evidences a certain charm . unlike the broad slapstick of the remake , the original has a gentler and more subtle humor , plus it takes the cat and the detective story more seriously . both stories share a common plot outline . ( the remake changes it so that the partial word becomes a profanity , and they make much of the fact that it is cuss word . whereas the new version has christina ricci as an apathetic teen , the original had the ever peppy hayley mills . whereas angst-ridden ricci tries to be unlikable , mills's cheerfulness and sweetness makes her eminently likable . kelso takes his job seriously , which actually makes the result funnier . the remake has doug e . doug as kelso , and he so overacts that it is embarrassing to watch him . jones does some slapstick in the original , but controls his acting . outlandishness by itself rarely provokes laughter . " i have the informant in sight , " radios one of the agent trackers . the more the agents believe , the better it works . the show has a strong supporting cast including william demarest , frank gorshin , roddy mcdowall , and ed wynn . they all contribute to several interesting subplots . my favorite part of the show ? the drive-in . she complains that " all the surfer movies are alike , " but they sit with their eyes glued to the screen anyway . the original that darn cat runs a little too long at 1 : 56 . it is rated g and contains nothing offensive . the movie is suitable for the entire family . my son jeffrey , almost 8 , likes both version , but prefers the remake . i hated the remake , but recommend the original and give it * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	barlach's grumpy demeanor , the strange circumstances of the case , and the unsettling swiss countryside , add a noir feel to this b & w film . martin ritt , who is usually a film director , plays his part with all the right quirks and nuances to make his role quite interesting . he reminded me a lot of peter falk's columbo . voight is a good counterbalance to ritt and to robert shaw's one-dimensional nazi-like villain role . he is able to bring an energy into the investigation , something that makes the implausible situation seem a little bit more plausible . but the ending , when all the game plans come together , left me slightly irked-- this easy to watch film , just didn't add up . it seemed as if the story tried too hard to make sure that man's sense of justice won't be mocked anymore , and i just couldn't buy into its easy solution , especially when for most of the film , confusion was the telling story . 
0	too bad the actors , in this imitation of a bad sitcom pilot , couldn't get their names removed from the credits . the dogs , who only drool and smile , deliver more lively and interesting performances . they are all vapid . in the few , the very few , times the movie approaches even mildly cute , the director kills the moment , almost as if he were trying to keep the movie from being funny . although marketed as a romantic comedy , in truth the movie belongs to a genre that might be called laughless non-romances . the studio did not screen the film in advance to critics in the hope , one suspects , that some people would see it before the word got out as to how bad it was . as in a daytime soap opera , the characters are captured in periodic shifts of their musical beds . in fact , you could probably write a better script from this premise than mcculloch did . " what you need is country and western music . " " what do you do ? " " i work writing classifieds , " he replies with his signature earnestness , as if his every answer had some hidden sad portent . " i've read your work -- some of it's pretty good , " she says . the scene , which is one of those with a modicum of promise , is killed by the dull tone that the director sets . when the two lovebirds , andy and lorna , go home to kiss , they look like a couple of adults trying to make fish mouths to entertain small children . surely these actors have kissed someone before . if not , they should have practiced in advance . maybe the movie's material was hopeless from the outset . i have spared the rest of the large cast from embarrassment by not mentioning their names . a sleep-inducing film , dog park simply has nothing to recommend it . it should have gone direct to video so that the lower price would make viewers feel slightly less cheated . it is rated r for sexuality and language and would be acceptable for teenagers .

1	his slow but steady transformation into political awareness is the most reassuring omen sent out in this non-didactic , straight forward ambitious project of sayles . the strength that comes from such a story , is in the telling of it and the powerful images presented . the problem with all this , is that since no specific country was named , it must mean that sayles considers this to be a universal problem , and that makes the problem gigantic , with no one to be specifically blamed , especially since these kind of human abuses have been going on for ages , it becomes difficult to zero in on what can be done to prevent such happenings . the other problem is that one can get the feeling that there reaches a point where one feels he is being manipulated , that there is so little that can be done by individuals alone , that governments have to be held accountable for their actions , and people have to be aware of what their governments are doing , even if , most of all , people have to learn how to help themselves . this is a very strong , independent minded picture , that chooses to tell a very difficult story , one that not many people will take comfort in . but the question arises as to how the message of such despair will get out to people who are so far removed from that isolated part of the world . it seems that this film might have some influence , but there is little that individuals who are not from that region can do , as proof we have just to look at the terrors faced by those in this film who tried to help . dennis schwartz : movie reviews ozus @sover . net 
1	mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , nudity , violence ) running time : 121 minutes . if jude strikes you as not at all typical of what you expect when you think about films based on " classic british novels , " it is only because it is quite faithful to its source material in its subject matter . thomas hardy's _jude the obscure_ was one of the most controversial novels of its time , one which inspired outraged reaction against its portrayal of adultery , atheism and marital sexuality . jude's still-relevant theme of the consequences of non-conformity make it a natural for cinematic treatment , and michael winterbottom has directed a beautifully filmed and beautifully acted adaptation . it is somewhat unfortunate , then , that jude is so true to the narrative thrust of hardy's novel yet falls short in plumbing its thematic depths . it is often a kind of critical laziness to tick off discrepancies between a film and its source material , but in the case of jude certain omissions create gaps of logic . hossein amini's script does a largely superb job of selecting where to condense scenes and delete sub-plots , losing little relevant narrative information , but there are problems with the development of character motivations . both arabella and phillotson are reduced to minor supporting players , and we don't understand enough about what their decisions mean to the story . one pivotal sequence focuses on jude's young son , who acts in a manner dependent on hardy's characterization of him as almost supernaturally mature and fatalistic . lost also are many of the contradictory facets of sue's personality , particularly her almost phobic aversion to sex . that is not to slight winslet's performance , which is captivating . both are well directed by winterbottom , who gives jude a kinetic energy , though his rush to include all the critical events in the story might leave you a bit dizzy . also outstanding is the cinematography of eduardo serra , both in the stark black-and-white of the prologue and in the muted colors of the body of the film . jude is certainly effective film-making , but it could have been more _affecting_ . this is a story of people challenging the social order at their own peril , and once winterbottom establishes that fact , jude is quite compelling . it simply takes a terribly long time for him to establish that fact , and as a result jude is an appealing but fairly conventional star-crossed love story for much of its two hours . winslet and eccleston are always able to make you care about whether or not sue and jude will find happiness , but amini and winterbottom should have been able to build the understanding that it was impossible . there are enough powerful moments and intriguing performances in jude to hold your interest , and the story still feels daring a century removed from its publication . there is just that small missing link that leaves jude's fundamental tragedy a bit too obscure . 
1	this tired formula is the essence of many studios' conservative approach to filmmaking . the predictably bland results may not excite audiences , but the risk of financial failure is greatly diminished . if enough people like the star and know the story , they will come , no matter how lame the production and how mediocre the reviews . thus it is with universal's dudley do-right , a live-action adaptation of the old kids' television cartoon . starring brendan fraser as dudley do-right , a royal canadian mountie who is one of the world's stupidest cops , the movie proves that some cartoons are hard to adapt to live-action . the grown-ups in dudley do-right just end up looking embarrassingly silly and are only sporadically funny . the slapstick humor is heavy on falling-down jokes . writer and director hugh wilson believes that , if having dudley fall out of his chair once can generate a few laughs , just have him do it again . alfred molina in a by-the-numbers performance plays snidely whiplash , an arch villain and dudley's long-time nemesis . although fraser has some nice moments , the only consistently enjoyable performance is that by corey burton who does the off-screen voice of the announcer . even so , his lines would work much better were the movie animated . among the few enjoyable parts of the movie is an indian dance extravaganza that looks like a river dance sequence as choreographed by busby berkeley . the movie takes a similarly simplistic approach . after the movie is over , horse's head appears through the screen as he sticks out his tongue to give it raspberries . my sentiments exactly . dudley do-right runs just 1 : 15 . it is rated pg for mild comic action violence and for brief language and innuendo . it would be fine for most kids . my son jeffrey , age 10 , who gave the move * * 1/2 , said , " even though i didn't laugh , i thought it was kind of funny .

2	screenplay : warren beatty and robert towne . making an old-fashioned romance isn't as easy as it might look . while films from this year like it could happen to you and only you attempted to re-create the magic of bygone love stories , they succeeded primarily in creating cloying pseudo-parodies of what those classic stories were all about : that perfect someone appearing at the most improbable--and inconvenient--time . love affair does it right . warren beatty and annette bening have taken this third telling of a tear-jerking classic and made it a warm , sentimental and beautifully filmed experience , limited in its effectiveness only by beatty's somewhat wooden lead performance . if there is one unquestionable triumph to love affair , it is the atmosphere . there is a lyricism to his direction , without the force qualities of other recent romances . cinematographer conrad l . hall shoots in deep oranges and with lots of filters , and photographs bening in the loving style which used to be reserved for grace kelly or ingrid bergman . ennio morricone's sweet , simple score also contributes to a mood which inspires you to hold your date's hand a bit more tightly . this is not to say that love affair gets by on style points alone . at the top of the list is bening , beatty's real life better half , who shines as terry . few actresses in film can manage the kind of mature , intelligent appeal she brings to her roles , which makes it a shame that her appearances have been so infrequent of late . here she is both savvy and vulnerable , more than a match for beatty's aging playboy but still harboring basic insecurities . it's not a flashy role--love affair is not a flashy movie--but it's a fine performance . garry shandling is a delight as kip , mike gambril's agent , toning down his usual neurotic persona and giving a witty reading , and harold ramis has a funny cameo as an acerbic accountant . it's one of love affair's most significant failings that that same scene does more to explain beatty's character than beatty himself manages to do . this could have proved to be a fatal flaw , but there is just enough inherent romance in the situation that their pairing doesn't seem completely implausible . but the cathartic final scene is effective enough to make up for the melancholy tone of the final half hour . sentimentality is frequently a tough sell . love affair may be schmaltz , but it is artfully executed and well-acted schmaltz . and it renews my faith that somewhere , someone knows how to make a real love story . 
0	nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air . if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . and thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough . he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production . the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance . that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness . audiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production . in fact , the marketing people are counting on it . no one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded . director simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) . what he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense . a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely . if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up . their tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) . in fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts . it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance . there's a word for people like you , nicolas . offender . 
2	some movies are so bad , they are good . so it is with classic b movie director edward bernds's queen of outer space ( 1958 ) staring that memorable hollywood celebrity zsa zsa gabor . unlike ed wood , his movies have a bit more polished look . queen of outer space is a parody of science fiction films . whether it meant to be so at the time is another question . i thought the guy in front of me was going to make himself sick he was laughing so hard . hey , this is venus remember . you know , goddess of love and all that . the costumes by irene caine and thomas pierce are the piece de resistance of the picture . the earthmen have boring padded blue space suits , but , ah , the venusian women . they all wear brightly colored micro-miniskirts , low cut tops , and high heeled shoes that appear to be made of cellophane . the queen also wears a mask , which appears to have been borrowed from a greek tragedy that was being made in the next studio . the casting of the film was its other success . bernds seems bent on finding people without any talent . proof of acting ability would probably have been sufficient prima facie evidence to disqualify them for queen of outer space . the women did have to meet a single qualification -- attractive legs . the men are portrayed as nincompoops who utter one insulting sexist phrase after another . typical is lt . turner's question of his captures , " why don't you girls knock off all this gestapo stuff and try to be a little friendly . " the more i watched the film , the more i became convinced that there would soon be a remake of it . i kept seeing director renny harlin remaking it with his wife geena davis playing a slightly tougher version of the zsa zsa gabor character . for the astronauts i thought tom hanks would be good for the captain's role since he is smartest of a dumb lot . the sets are hokey and constructed with bright and gaudy colors . the " beta disintegrater " looks like something a kindergarten class might put together . the print of the film is a fresh one with strong color rendition . it is in surprisingly excellent shape . glad to hear you're on our side . " the men are too busy enjoying being outnumbered to ever want to return . my favorite in the film has to be zsa zsa . just so long as you can get into the spirit of the parody , this is one funny show . sort of the airport of the time . queen of outer space runs just 1 : 20 . it is not rated but would be pg . there is no sex , nudity , bad language , or violence other than people vanishing when shot with ray guns . i suspect kids would have to be ten or so to enjoy the picture . i expected to hate the film , but instead found myself laughing hard and often . i recommend this spoof to you and award it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	screenplay : rafael yglesias and ariel dorfman . director : roman polanski . one of 1994's most unintentionally hilarious films was the adaptation of isabel allende's the house of the spirits , a bloated epic in which jeremy irons , meryl streep , glenn close and winona ryder were supposed to be playing latin americans . it baffled me that such casting could take place in an age where an anglo playing any other race would incite riots , and the casting of spirits was ultimately much of its undoing . roman polanski has made the same choice with death and the maiden , and again it was a very bad one . while as a concept death and the maiden is strong and intriguing enough to maintain interest , it is sabotaged by actors who often appear not to have the faintest idea what to do with the material . the psychological underpinnings of death and the maiden are a complex set of relationships and interactions which make for an extremely promising story . at its heart is paulina's conviction in miranda's guilt , a conviction which we should always doubt because of her paranoia and unreliability . unfortunately , as it plays out , the performances and direction make our choice far too easy for us . sigourney weaver is part of the problem , playing paulina not just over the top ( which is probably where the role should be ) but so far over the top that she falls off the top . weaver as a personality simply seems too strong to be so close to complete breakdown , so she makes up for it by contorting her face and snarling . he plays miranda as such a little weasel that if he's not guilty of this particular crime , we figure he must be guilty of _something_ . the part requires more ambiguity , and the very talented kingsley just doesn't deliver in this case . perhaps even more disappointing is the relationship between paulina and gerardo , which is remarkably intricate . all this is in the text , but somehow director roman polanski doesn't let it out . paulina never seems to love gerardo , while gerardo is mostly befuddled . the moments when they do reveal themselves , all in very stagy speeches , ring hollow because the same truths should have been evident in the performances . one scene shows what might have been , late in the film when kingsley makes a confession . polanski holds a very long take on kingsley , refusing to cut to weaver's reaction , and at that moment you genuinely wonder whether this is a guilty man spilling his guts or an innocent man giving the performance of a lifetime to save his skin . but moments later , polanski cops out with a too-obvious resolution . the performances in death and the maiden should have created a mystery . instead , the mystery is why they couldn't make the material work . 
1	director : alan parker . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , brief nudity , sexual situations ) running time : 145 minutes . i have not read the much-loved memoir by frank mccourt on which angela's ashes is based , but every indication is that the film re-creates mccourt's limerick of the 1930s and 1940s magnificently . it's a life of almost inhuman squalor , compounded by the effects of unemployment and alcoholism . it's the kind of life you might not believe existed if someone hadn't committed his life story to the page . as a snapshot of existence in this particular time and place , alan parker's adaptation of angela's ashes is exemplary . as a compelling story , it's not half as effective . things are not much better there , as malachy is rarely able to find work , and drinks what little money he manages to earn . biographical stories can be tricky to pull off dramatically , since it's easy to portray them as a series of stand-alone episodes rather than part of a thematically consistent story . that's the problem that plagues angela's ashes in parker's attempt to maintain the integrity of mccourt's tales . this is a film composed almost entirely of vignettes : frank's first communion , frank's work on the coal heap , frank's visit with some classmates to see his first naked girls , etc . some of them amuse , and some of them are touching , but few of them resonate the way it seems they should . instead , it plays as just one more vignette in a life of first communion , work on the coal heap and seeing naked girls . the one place angela's ashes does resonate -- if all too briefly -- is in the portrayal of frank's father . carlyle's performance , combining a strange pride and sincere intentions with a pathetic sickness of the soul , is one of the best things about angela's ashes ( emily watson , by comparison , has little to do but smoke and look determined ) . the wrenching moments in which malachy disappoints his family -- particularly when frank tries to balance his disappointment with his love for his father -- give the film its emotional weight . when malachy leaves the narrative , it never quite has as much to say . i can imagine that device giving his experiences more immediacy , something to sustain the story beyond mere sympathy for young frank's plight . as a film , angela's ashes works mostly as a period record , with production designer geoffrey kirkland , costume designer consolata boyle and cinematographer michael seresin working their technical magic on a somber , straightforward script . too much of it is admirable without necessarily being engaging , serving as a mere litany of childhood miseries . without the father/son angle that had served the film so well , angela's ashes drifts into two and a half hours of variations on a grim , grimy theme . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	the commissioner is a film that is as cold and flat as a brussels winter , where the film is set . if you think making a suspense story about the european commission would not exactly be a natural , you'd be right . as the backdrop for a political thriller , it doesn't have much credible oomph . christina kallas's script is filled with macho industrialists spouting pompous , hackneyed lines , like " remember this , james , the weak perish . " my personal " favorite " is the rich american capitalist with the large cowboy hat , who warns , without cracking a smile , " cemeteries are filled with people who underestimated me . " it's enough to make students want to bypass chemical engineering and business majors as too malevolent . in a slow movie that suffers from a lack of twists , the ending twist is laughably implausible . only john hurt's performance partially saves the movie . it is not yet rated but will probably be an r for some profanity , violence and sexuality and would be fine for teenagers . 
1	starring : joe pesci , christian slater , victoria abril director : barry levinson producers : mark johnson and barry levinson screenplay : barry levinson music : robbie robertson released by paramount pictures barry levinson had an idea , and a pretty good one at that : take an actor , have him assume the role of a vigilante and , as public adulation of his assumed personae escalates , blur the line between being a vigilante and acting the part . unfortunately , the idea is all that mr . levinson had , because the final result--jimmy hollywood--is a somnolent mess . they either aren't very interesting ( pesci's jimmy ) , aren't interesting and are annoying ( slater's william ) , or aren't interesting and don't have a purpose ( abril's lorraine ) . the fault is not entirely that of the script , since none of the principals gives a noteworthy performance . mr . pesci , known for his caged energy , comes across as bland throughout . mr . slater and ms . abril successfully manage to blend into the scenery . for a comedy , this isn't very funny . there are a few lines here and there worthy of a chuckle , but most of the jokes fall through , and some are difficult to recognize as attempts at humor . the dramatic elements aren't much more successful , although several intriguing ideas are proposed--such as the role of vigilantism in our society and what a media frenzy can drive a person to do . none of these are original , but they're worthy of consideration . unfortunately , jimmy hollywood doesn't do that very well , either . the film's tone is uneven , with lengthy periods of sluggishness punctuated by bursts of action . the ending is dragged out at least twice as long as it needs to be . the best part of jimmy hollywood , and it is very good , is the sequence over which the end credits are shown . this minute-long spoof , featuring an unexpected , uncredited cameo , is almost worth sitting through the rest of the film for . almost , that is , but not quite . the other interest- capturing moments are few , far between , and quickly over . barry levinson's work in the past has ranged from excellent ( avalon ) to mediocre ( bugsy ) to awful ( toys ) . jimmy hollywood falls far closer to being in the latter category than either of the former ones . in this case , let the preview be your guide to the movie--it's an accurate representation of something that's flat , uninspired , and desperately trying--and failing--to be witty and clever . 
1	twenty years ago , a film like mad city would have been a provocative and disturbing exploration of how television news can exploit a story to feed our blood-lust . in fact , it was . . . it paddy chayefsky's brilliant script and peter finch's mesmerizing final performance as unraveling anchorman howard beale made network a classic of dark satire , spotlighting the natural culmination of an obsessive pursuit of ratings . it was just outrageous enough to be entertaining , and just plausible enough to be alarming . the notion that televison news isn't just about the news . . . well , it just isn't news . it never manages to arouse much more than nods of recognition , because the images and situations are familiar to the point of cliche : alda's self-important anchorman , the selective editing of a story to fit a pre-determined agenda , the absurdity of a growing media feeding frenzy . as an ethics lesson , it's strident but ineffective , preaching to a nation of converts about a problem they all know exists but have no idea how to correct . it's fortunate , then , that mad city does a solid job of giving its subject a human face . that face doesn't belong to dustin hoffman , though brackett is the story's central character . playing simple challenges any actor , yet travolta plays simple with a disarming effectiveness . the relationship moments between baily and brackett are among the strongest in mad city , though it also provides a few chuckles as the public sympathies sway in the breeze . like most " message " films , however , it begins to wilt every time it underlines its message . mad city's primary stumbling block is its obviousness -- of the character developments , of the plot progression , of the scolding tone the film takes towards its targets . it reaches an audience which doesn't find sensationalism disturbing , but it delivers its story as though no one else had told it before . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
2	like-yet-unlike vanya on 42nd street , this version of the story gives a modern slant to the russian play . at its core , country life is about lost opportunities and milking the most from one's lot in life . thrown in for good measure are themes of unrequited love , pacifism , and contrasts of city and country lifestyles . if there was ever any doubt about the ageless quality of chekhov's story , this transplant , which shifts not only country but time ( it's 1919 ) , should dispel such notions . it wouldn't have taken much more imagination to bring it into the modern world . the unfortunate result confirms sally's opinion that this risk might not the best course . it's odd that deborah , whose single goal in life is to be cocooned in safety , is the catalyst for such a gamble . country life , like vanya , ripples with repressed and unleashed emotions . there's also a fair amount of humor , and these breaks of levity keep the film from sinking into lugubriousness . none of the characters or their stories are short-changed and , by the end , there is a satisfying sense of closure , even though no relationship has turned out as it might in a hollywood script . greta scacchi is adequate as deborah , but somehow doesn't seem the sort to stir the passions of three men . taken as a whole , country life is effective , if not groundbreaking . like something from merchant-ivory , it moves slowly , allowing the characters opportunity to breathe . as either an introduction to uncle vanya or a new take on the story , michael blakemore's production works , reaffirming that creativity can raise a phoenix from the ashes of a great classic . 
0	in louis morneau's bats , these unnecessarily maligned creatures are noshing on the residents of gallop , texas -- not that you'll care . a direct rip-off of the birds , although without any of its suspense and with no improvements in the special effects over hitchcock's 1963 classic , this cheap-looking movie never rises above the level of a popcorn flick . check your brain at the door , order lots of snacks from the concession stand and eat slowly . you won't exactly be entertained , but you'll probably stay awake as you munch away . so which actors set off your casting red flags ? for me they include lou diamond phillips and burt reynolds , although both , admittedly , have -- on rare occasions -- done some nice acting . kimsey will do and say more dumb things that you can count . the problem with the direction and with john logan's script is that both treat the laughably bad material with dead seriousness . only as a parody does the show have a chance . no matter how ludicrous the story gets , meyer acts like she thinks she's making a public health documentary about some genuine threat . sheila's black assistant , jimmy sands ( le ? n ) , in a heavily stereotyped role , at least tries -- without any success -- to elicit a few much needed laughs . " i like 'em , but at a distance , a real distance like on 'wild kingdom , ' " he explains to his boss sheila . among jimmy's other lines in the unoriginal script are : " houston , we've got a problem , " and " i don't know about the rest of you , but i don't want anyone moving up the food chain . period . " ( people say " period " a lot in this film . it's the writer's pedantic way of reminding you of the supposed importance of the sentence . ) the movie falls back on every tired horror movie clich ? . when you were a teenager , you might have had some fun and memorable times there . but in horror movies , nothing good ever happens to kids who visit one . and in this movie nothing good ever happens for the audience . enjoy that popcorn . it'll be the best part of the experience of watching bats . it is incorrectly rated pg-13 for intense sequences of bat attacks and brief language . having bloody corpses with guts everywhere and showing ferocious attacks , the movie clearly should have been rated r by the mpaa , not pg-13 . the film would be acceptable for those teenagers who aren't prone to nightmares , but the movie is inappropriate for anyone less than 13 . 
0	for the record , i don't tend to put much stock in conspiracy theories . call me a starry-eyed optimist if you must , but i think people are capable of quite enough selfish nastiness on an individual basis , and that that very same selfishness makes cooperative nastiness an endeavor riddled with problems . when it comes to hollywood , however , i might be willing to make an exception . studios just may be conspiring to sap from our brains the ability to recognize clumsy stories which make only the faintest sense . by comparison to the crimes shadow conspiracy perpetrates on an unsuspecting audience , the crimes in its so-called plot seem positively benign . sheen appears to be basing his film career on playing the dupe ( he was also a patsy sniffing out dirty doings in terminal velocity and the arrival ) , but if he could be suckered into taking on a script like this , perhaps he's not doing all that much acting . shadow conspiracy , credited to the writing tandem of adi hasak and ric gibbs , appears to be the product of screenplay software , introducing hackneyed situations and characters without enough energy to make the cliches tolerable . the betrayal , the chase scene , the narrow escape . . . all the ingredients are there , but they sit there flatly without the benefit of a single moment of imagination if the basic material is bad , then the execution is even worse . the direction ( by rambo's george p . cosmatos ) and editing ( by robert a . ferretti ) in shadow conspiracy are inept to a degree that seems almost ( conspiratorially ? ) designed . one chase flashes from a luxury hotel to a homeless encampment to a sewer out of les miserables with a blissful disregard for continuity ; scenes designed for tension become inconsequential blurs , and characters wander through the narrative for an hour before you have a clue what they are supposed to be doing . cosmatos doesn't even understand basic principles of drama , making a point of showing us a tricky-to-unlatch seat-belt which then plays no further part in the story , an un-fired gun which probably sent chekhov to spinning in his grave . that climactic scene at least provides a moment of absurdist fun , the only one shadow conspiracy has to offer unless you count the floppy hats hamilton favors which are sure to gain a white house correspondent professional respect . mostly , it is just a plodding and somber piece of nonsense which seems to expect brownie points for showing us all the ways the government can keep an eye on us , and ends with an ominous tracking shot to the perspective of a spy satellite . personally , i feel more threatened by the prospect of lazy , pre-fabricated thrillers foisted off on the american viewing public as entertainment . if the people who brought us shadow conspiracy are supposed to be the ones to shine the light on sinister conspiracies which threaten our freedoms , all i have to say is : who's watching the watchmen ? 
1	the poverty row studio monogram pictures picked the series up for the remaining episodes and the quality diminished . the film has many plot twists and the usual chan setup for the mystery story to unfold . but the story is far-fetched and tries too hard to be mysterious , which causes it to falter in credibility . but the desert atmosphere of the 16th-century castle , the usual comic antics of number two son , and all the suspects moving cautiously around the dark corners of the castle , should please charlie chan fans and give them their usual thrills . 
1	to me , the idea of a sequel to the fugitive always seemed like a bad idea . as re-invented here , girard is a generic action hero ; most of the quirks that made him interesting ( and that earned jones an oscar ) are absent . with a few minor re- writes , john mcclane from the die hard movies could have been plugged into this role . the script tries to recapture the energy of the fugitive by re- cycling various plot elements . unfortunately , it's not just one chase -- it's one after another after another . the repetitiveness quickly grows tiresome , and the movie ends up lasting at least thirty minutes too long . the bloated running length has nothing to do with extra time needed to unravel the needlessly convoluted plot . it simply offers an opportunity for the characters to do a lot more running around before the final , inevitable confrontation between girard , sheridan , and a traitor ( whose identity , despite being easy to guess , shall remain unrevealed here ) . snipes' sheridan appears to have undergone a personality extraction -- there's nothing deeper than the bare-bones " innocent guy on the run . " most of the supporting characters are equally faceless , with the exception of joe pantoliano's cosmo , who acts like he drinks too much coffee . while i enjoyed the fugitive , i wasn't the film's biggest booster . i thought the coincidence-laden plot was poorly constructed . but the action sequences were often nail-biters , the lead characters were well- developed , and the dialogue was intelligent . u . s . marshals exhibits many of the fugitive's faults with few of its strengths . as a result , this movie is a routine exercise in stunt choreography , with more valleys than peaks , and not enough tension to keep the viewer engaged for the full 143-minute length . u . s . marshals is workmanlike , and that makes it , at best , a marginal choice for theatrical viewing . " my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . " -- david puttnam 
2	the first thing i thought of when i heard the title of this film was a line from the godfather : " luca brasi sleeps with the fish . " granted , sleeping isn't the same thing as dreaming , but it's close enough . it could be argued ( fairly successfully , i think ) that dream with the fishes doesn't do enough with its subject matter . but , while it's true that there's a wealth of untapped material here , what is on screen is handled with the necessary aptitude to captivate an audience . because the dialogue has a tendency to be trite , the characters are spottily-developed , and the acting is variable , dream with the fishes is not a great film . nevertheless , it is a good film , and it's hard to deny the simple power of the climax . first time director finn taylor successfully avoids the pitfall of skidding into melodrama . the characters are presented on their own terms , and they don't lose their abrasive sides simply to make us more comfortable with them . the director also doesn't opt for the " arm's length " perspective -- we may not find either terry or nick appealing , but that doesn't prevent us from empathizing with them . dream with the fishes isn't meant to be watched from a detached viewpoint any more than it's intended to provoke streams of tears . however , while the movie's approach , which shuns the nihilism of a savage nights and the mawkishness of a my life , is on-target , the tone is off . the opening scenes are rife with the mistakes of a freshman film maker , and it shows . for a while , taylor doesn't seem to know where he's going and the actors don't have a solid handle on their characters . although david arquette , brad hunt , and kathryn erbe gradually grow into their on-screen alter egos , the first third of the picture is marred by awkward , unconvincing performances . the good news is that as dream with the fishes progresses , it exhibits considerable improvement . we also learn that the tragedy of terry's life isn't what we think it is . despite his constant assertion that he has no fantasies , we learn that his entire life is balanced on an intricate fabrication less stable than a house of cards . while the ending offers hope , it remains carefully ambiguous , shunning an obvious hollywood denouement . at times , dream with fishes is dream-like . the film's grainy look creates a gritty , down-to-earth mood . there are no pastels or beautiful vistas here . irrespective of the heavy nature of the story , there are moments of sharp comedy ( a cop's reaction to a dose of acid ) and giddy exuberance ( naked bowling ) . however , dream with the fishes is still afflicted with the kind of quirkiness that has become a hallmark of generation x films . at least in this case , it seems better controlled than in many similar films about ennui . dream with the fishes is definitely flawed , and many of its faults are opaque , but the film possesses a compelling quality that can draw an audience into the story and make us care about the characters . taylor gets many of the details right and offers enough small surprises to make his directorial debut worthwhile . this combined buddy movie/road movie veers off the interstate to follow a less commonly traveled course . 
2	in fact , after having viewed this spectacle in a theater , i have difficulty envisioning how its impact could be close to the same on the small screen . this is perhaps surprising considering that gettysburg was originally intended to be a tnt mini-series , and only after its completion , when ted turner realized the quality of the material he had on his hands , was the decision made to go for a theatrical run first . those who are not daunted by the running time ( two-hundred thirty-four minutes , easily the longest general release motion picture in a long while ) will be grateful for the decision . yet it does far more than that . rather than functioning as a text book come to life , the film uses its actors to flesh out characters from history , giving not only personalities to those on both sides of the struggle , but believable causes as well . we are presented with the rare opportunity to see not only the clash of arms on the field of battle , but the clash of wills before it . in what it manages to do , gettysburg is an exceptional motion picture , but this is true even moreso for the manner in which it manages to do it . the film is adept at the tricky art of pacing , and just as the slower , dramatic elements of the story threaten to bog down gettysburg , the rousing battle scenes start anew . the film opens with exposition and introduction . coming at the beginning as it does , this sequence isn't difficult to get through . then , with the onset of night , there's a lull , and an opportunity for more character development and introspection . with the morning of july 2 , there's the defense of little roundtop under the command of col . chamberlain ( jeff daniels ) , a truly amazing sequence that lasts nearly an hour and keeps the audience involved and enthralled for the entire time . when the intermission occurs , it hardly seems possible that the film is more than half over . while this section of the film may be a little too talky , it is positioned immediately after the intermission when the audience is better able to tolerate a slower forty minutes . the climax - pickett's charge - is even more engrossing than the defense of little round top , if that's possible . those who get a few nape hairs standing on end will not be alone . historical accuracy was of great concern to the producers and director . the result is a movie that looks - and feels - real . admittedly , the battles are not as stunning or well-choreographed as those in glory , but this doesn't damage the effectiveness of the film , since gettysburg's clashes are still impressive glory's r-rating and narrower focus allowed it to have spectacular battle sequences ( the same is true of the 1700s drama the last of the mohicans ) . gettysburg , a far more ambitious project , had two major handicaps : limiting the brutality of its depiction for the pg-rating , and getting far more extras into position ( the logistics of this picture must have been a nightmare ) . additionally , the camerawork in edward zwick's magnificent drama had a more grand scope than kees van oostrum's work here ( although , to van oostrum's credit , there are a number of breathtaking shots - most of which occur after the battles , however ) . the cast gathered for this recreation is impressive . there are no high- orbit names like tom cruise or alec baldwin to distract the viewer . while berenger and sheen are certainly known and recognized , their profiles , like their performances , are low-key . both do solid jobs , and are especially effective at bringing out the more human sides of the officers . more impressive than berenger and sheen are jeff daniels and the late richard jordan . daniels gives a remarkable rendering of col . chamberlain , investing the legend with all the foibles and failures of humanity , and making us understand exactly why his name has been so lauded . gen . lewis armstead , is the standout on the confederate side , and his powerful portrayal is given an added dash of poignancy by the realization that the actor is no longer with us . in epic movies , especially those that feature battles , the musical score takes on added significance . while not a masterpiece of originality or modern composition , randy edelman's work is loud , triumphant , and inspirational - qualities which are perfect for the battle scenes . not as effective are his themes for the quieter , more dramatic moments . could gettysburg have been shorter ? there are probably a few sequences that might have been trimmed without doing much damage , but the finished product would still have been around four hours . further cutting would have reduced either the spectacle of the battles or the insight into certain characters , neither of which would have been desirable . all things considered , this film is close to the perfect length . epic motion pictures are a rarity these days - even more rare than films about the civil war . gettysburg should satisfy both cravings , at least for a while . this film is perfectly placed in the wake of ken burns' pbs series ( burns , incidentally , has a small role here as the aide to union gen . hancock ) for any who have a re-kindled interest in this segment of american history . for those with little more than a passing interest , gettysburg is still gripping enough to captivate in its own right . ambitious and successful , it is easily one of the most glorious u . s . productions of the year . 
2	screenplay : elizabeth cuthrell , david urrutia and oren moverman , based on the book by denis johnson . director : alison maclean . jesus' son is a film about addiction -- only it's not , really . the way we're used to seeing films about addiction , there's a message , a lesson , an agenda . drugs are bad , the effects of drugs on users and their immediate circle of acquaintances are worse , and our hero would be a perfectly happy and productive member of society if not for that thing he wouldn't just say no to . these tend to be films in which the ostensible messed-up protagonist isn't really the center of the film . it's the needle that's the center of the film , or the bottle , or the rolled-up $100 bill . addiction isn't just the theme ; it's the star . so let's re-phrase that introduction : jesus' son is a film about fh ( billy crudup ) -- short for f * * * head -- a man who eventually becomes an addict . fh narrates his story with all the straight-ahead narrative lucidity you'd expect of a perpetually stoned guy ; he riccochets back and forth in time , picking up one thread of the story in the middle of another story when he recalls something he's forgotten to tell us . director alison maclean and her trio of writers give jesus' son a playfulness that's entertaining even as it never shies away from the darkest sides of addiction . it's a film with the wonderfully scrambled logic of drug use itself . but in case you missed the caveat , this is not exactly a film about addiction . crudup finds a cohesiveness to fh's character through the episodic film , and even manages to keep up with jack black's scene-stealing orderly in the film's most hilarious segments . jesus' son works not because the individual scenes are so effective ( though they are ) or because the portrayal of addiction is so grimly affecting ( because it is not ) , but because fh is a great anchor for a film that heads in so many different directions . perhaps inevitably , jesus' son eventually turns to the subject of fh's attempts to get straight , and it's a bit depressing that the film loses so much steam once drugs are no longer involved . perhaps the come-down is relative after such a wonderful first hour ; perhaps there's nothing for an episodic film to do but find a somewhat arbitrary place to stop . even the sluggish conclusion can't diminish the surprising , darkly comic experience of jesus' son , however . how refreshing to see addiction take a back seat to the addict , to see the needle in its appropriate place as supporting player . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
2	director : anand tucker . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 121 minutes . from its opening minutes , hilary and jackie promises intriguing spins on a couple of time-worn dramatic set-ups : the competitive siblings , and the tortured artistic genius . director anand tucker's adaptation of hilary's memoir ( co-written with brother piers ) introduces some provocative questions regarding how and why a prodigy becomes an artist . jackie's success surpasses hilary's not through superior inate talent , it is suggested , but through superior effort , exemplifying the 99% perspiration in that aphorism about what makes genius . if tucker and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce had explored the siblings' relationship as effectively as they explore their respective careers , hilary and jackie might have been a brilliant film . as it stands , it's a pretty good one which offers wildly disparate insight into its two main characters . there's a spark of curiosity as jackie makes an incredible request of her sister , but we never get a clear enough sense of why hilary grants that request . it's a great performance as a great character , yet it's disappointing that we watch her interact with her cello nearly as much as she interacts with hilary . though jackie's sense of isolation is the theme of the film's second half , it doesn't allow us to understand what these two women were to each other . hilary and jackie is a revelation when it allows us to see what people surrender for art , as well as why people surrender their art . as a family affair , it's more labor than genius . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
2	" i can sit there and do nothing as good as anyone , " margaret explains in her rationale for why she should be considered just as competent as the workers she fills in for . pamela marcotte's sets create a scarily sterile office environment that is creepily realistic . the wry script , by the director and her sister , karen sprecher , is full of subtle humor and poignancy . even when the dilbert-like situations are exaggerated , they always possess gems of frightening truth . although the story is more a comedy of manners coupled with social satire , it takes the time to develop the four women into real characters with interesting backgrounds . the last half of the story concerns a mystery about an office kleptomaniac , but the movie doesn't leave much doubt about the identity of the miscreant . the film creates four individuals whose plights are easy to empathize with and who are naturally funny without trying to be so . with its kafkaesque plot , the characters are more pitiable than hilarious , although they are both and usually at the same time . it is rated pg-13 for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 10 and up although its office-based humor may even be over the heads of most teenagers . 
2	but there is a tiny problem . written by arleen sorkin , and paul slansky and glenn gordon caron , the script of picture perfect takes the typical romantic comedy formula and puts enough spin on it to make it fresh . the intelligent dialog has plenty of funny one-liners , but the film's beauty revolves around the effective character development of the lead . kate's would-be lovers and her challenges at work make for an involving tapestry . as directed by glenn gordon caron , the director of the excellent but relatively unknown clean and sober , the film focuses everything on kate and lets her set the show's pacing . with her terrific looks , her happy and vivacious demeanor and her tenacity , aniston gives a compelling performance as a hyperactive career woman , while making kate an incredibly likable character . " i feel like i can be honest with you , " says the guy as he is being shown the door . darcy is the one who devises the fake picture stratagem . how that plays out makes up the last half of the film . toward the end the story turns bittersweet . the inevitable scene where kate tells the truth is clumsily written and delivered . the ending itself is exactly what you would expect from a typical romantic comedy . one would have wished that the writers could have come up with something fresher . a hard edged surprise ending would have been better but would probably have been dropped after the first test screening . even if the ending is a disappointment , kate is a fun person to hang out with for a couple of hours . picture perfect runs 1 : 45 . it is rated pg-13 for sexual situations and language . the film would be fine for kids around twelve and up . i recommend the film to you and give it * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	mpaa rating : r ( nudity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 95 minutes . a little over an hour into dark city , three of the film's central characters sit in a small boat , rowing slowly through a canal . sutherland prattles on with his plot summary for around five minutes , his wheezing , mannered peter lorre-meets-the elephant man delivery growing more insufferable by the moment , his character rapidly becoming something akin to austin powers' sir basil exposition . it's the sort of lazy , aggravating scene which is all too common in science-fiction/fantasy films , but in dark city it's even more aggravating . you see , sutherland's interminable synopsis consists of three distinct sub-categories : 1 ) stuff already explicitly stated in the equally lazy opening narration ; 2 ) stuff which should have been painfully easy to show rather than tell ; 3 ) stuff a viewer should have been able to figure out by actually watching the preceding hour instead of waiting for someone to give him the gist of it . and therein one can spot why it's a bad idea to take a dark existential thriller and pitch it at 15-year-olds . director and co-writer alex proyas ( the crow ) begins with several intriguing ideas -- the nature of identity , love as present experience versus collected experience , modern paranoia about loss of control -- but he seems so afraid of losing his audience that he keeps slowing down to allow the stragglers to catch up . every time dark city begins building towards a sense of mystery or menace , a convenient , prosaic bit of dialogue breaks the spell to start spelling everything out . i can't even work up much enthusiasm for the look of dark city , with its pale , bald antagonists and a few morphing twists added to the bleak-chic cityscapes of modern science-fantasy . despite its brief flirtations with profound philosophical questions , it's really just another good-looking vessel in which a cast of second-tier stars ( sutherland , jennifer connelly ) and slumming " serious actors " ( sewell , richardson , hurt ) is asked to rattle around for 90 minutes until the special effects budget runs out . it didn't necessarily have to be like that , not with a provocative premise as promising as that of blade runner . it simply takes guts to let a premise like that play itself out , the kind of guts studio executives generally don't have . i wouldn't be surprised to find out that word came down to proyas to compromise his vision , to create something virtually impossible to walk out of saying " i don't get it . " that kind of story-telling buys you long , slow boat rides down a cinematic canal , where explorations of a shattered human mindscape give way to the pointless tour-guide ramblings of sir kiefer exposition . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
0	when home alone was released in 1990 , it was a breath of fresh air , and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely-funny family film . the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel , so , two years later , we were subjected to home alone 2 , which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited . for john hughes , two home alone movies weren't enough ? he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with , including a pathetic box office bomb called baby's day out , last year's live-action 101 dalmatians , and this year's flubber . now , inexplicably , hughes has exhumed not only these worn-out plot elements , but the " home alone " name as well . he's not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was . the villains , pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern , are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber . the movie's climax takes place during a raging snowstorm ? only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable . previously , the most counterfeit-looking snow effects i can remember were in star trek iii . these are far worse . in fact , the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this near-blizzard when a shining sun can be seen . if it's a wonderful life could generate real- looking snow back in the 1940s , why can't home alone 3 , which has a significantly larger budget and '90s technology at its disposal ? there has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of live-action cartoon violence for young children . it's one thing to see wyle e . coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight , but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen . adults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous , but what about five and six-year olds ? not only is home alone 3 unnecessary , but it's offensive . it's an exercise in tediousness , and there isn't a genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end ( unless , by some strange quirk of fate , you have missed every 1990s movie associated with john hughes , and thus haven't seen this stuff before ) . i can't imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure . maybe that's why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in their thumb-sucking years . " for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake . " 
0	date released : varies ( limited distribution ) running length : 1 : 47 rated : nr ( nudity , sex , language , mature themes ) most of these , however , have explored male relationships . the film has its interesting points , but almost all are realized on an intellectual and not an emotional level . there's a great deal of academic discussion on the differences between heterosexual and homosexual relationships , the nature of intimacy , and why there is so much difficulty communicating in modern society . while the viewer may not always agree with the conclusions of the characters , it's impossible to deny that the reasoning is well thought-out and the topics are certainly worth investigation . there's another interesting feature about claire of the moon that may make some male viewers squirm a little . men are not treated particularly well in this film , and writer/director nicole conn makes no apologies for this . how many times have women fit this role in male-oriented movies ? claire of the moon ultimately fails because it does a poor job of entertaining . while the film undoubtedly attempts to pique the intellect , it is , above all else , a love story and , as such , should rouse the emotions as well . for a number of reasons , it proves entirely unable to do so . first and foremost is the amateurish quality of the screenplay . on top of that , the dialogue is unbelievably stilted . people talk like they're reading from an intellectual treatise . i know a lot of people with excellent vocabularies and they don't talk anything like the characters in claire of the moon . the acting isn't going to win any awards either . at their best moments , the principles are merely adequate . their characters lack depth , more often acting as mouthpieces for a philosophy than as the unique people they're supposed to be . worse still are the five or six supporting performers who consistently go annoyingly over-the-top . one character in particular ( caren graham's tara o'hara ) is so awful--a walking cliche with a terrible southern accent--that the film is painful to watch when she's on-screen . finally , the nicole conn's direction isn't much better than her writing . she has a lot of mellow scenery shots with claire in reflective poses that look like they belong on the cover of romance novels . accompanied by a " dreamy " score , these moments are almost comically absurd . then there are the two fantasy sequences , which look and sound like poorly-conceived music videos . there can't be many copies of this film , because the one that i saw ( on the second day of release ) was not in good condition , an indication that the print has been shipped from city-to-city . this is a minor quibble , but it is noticeable , especially at the beginning . while it's possible to applaud the motives of claire of the moon , as well as its message , the project is simply not a strong enough movie to recommend . this is a good example of a small , independent film that boasts neither high production values nor good acting . it is a single-issue picture that's too flawed to be given the serious attention the subject warrants . 
0	gosh , aren't fart jokes funny ? and if you've blown upwards of fifty bucks to take your family to the movies , you'll certainly want lots of them for your entertainment dollar . how about flatulence so intense that it literally sets a restaurant on fire ? now , that would really be funny . right ? the only commendable part of the production is the amazing make-up effects that allow murphy to look like a wide variety of obese characters . the writing credits for this abomination are shared by no less than 5 writers : steve oedekerk , barry w . blaustein , david sheffield , paul weitz and chris weitz . the movie will probably make a bundle , but , surely , they could have come up with more imaginative material than this smelly batch of recycled bathroom humor . they even stoop to having an octogenarian mistakenly eat a large piece of feces . this " r " movie , which is incorrectly rated pg-13 , is actually written with dumbed-down humor that seems designed to appeal to 8-year-old boys' crude sensibilities . but , the movie would certainly not be appropriate for anyone younger than their teenage years . among other offensive scenes are those of killer turds and an animal having anal sex with a human . moreover , crudeness does not equal funny , as the renowned farrelly brothers ( there's something about mary ) demonstrated recently in me , myself & irene , a much better film than nutty professor ii . at least the mpaa correctly rated me , myself & irene as an r . both films share about the same level of coarseness in their brand of attempted humor . there are plenty of subplots involving the rest of the fat klump clan . " i've been taking them like m&ms . " i tried hard to think of good things about the movie other than the make-up . all i can come up with is that janet jackson , as the professor's girlfriend , does have a particularly inviting smile . ( another would be that murphy mumbles half of his lines , which partially spares us from some of the film's inanities . ) that's it . if you're still dead set on wasting your money on this film , don't say i didn't warn you . it is officially rated pg-13 for " crude humor and sex-related material . " consider it an r . it would be acceptable for most teenagers , but i'd certainly advise against anyone seeing it . 
2	without exception , the indian in the cupboard is the best family film to come along thus far in 1995 , topping such notables as pocahontas and the little princess . based on the popular book by lynne reid banks and scripted by et writer melissa mathison , the movie teaches lessons without preaching , and focuses on the magic of relationships rather than that of special effects . this leads to a production as affecting for adults as for children . omri , played with charm and enthusiasm by hal scardino , is an average nine-year old with a very unusual cupboard in his room . the visual effects that mix four-foot actors with their miniature companions are effective , but not ostentatious , and the lack of flash keeps the focus on the characters and their story . suspension of disbelief in the indian in the cupboard is surprisingly easy . this film is about friendships , responsibility , and ethics . the bond between omri and little bear illustrates that , regardless of size , shape , or race , any friendship is a rare and special thing . thirteen years ago , et taught the same lesson to that summer's movie audiences . frank oz , a director who always seeks original and challenging projects ( one of his past successes was little shop of horrors ) , brings an uplifting sense of fun to this film . the indian in the cupboard moves along at a nearly-perfect pace : slowly enough to capture the nuances of the characters' relationships , but quickly enough to avoid stagnation . it deserves a better fate than that normally reserved for similar fare because , ultimately , this movie is not only about magic -- it is magical . 
1	there comes a time in a critic's life when he simply has nothing to say about a film as gruellingly generic as mercury rising , but he's got space to fill so he keeps on jabbering away anyway . this is the kind of action film where dogs jump out of nowhere to spook the audience , where glass shatters in slow motion , and where children are placed in jeopardy . it's the kind of action film which went through a slew of title changes -- from simple simon to simon to mercury falling to mercury rising -- but may as well have been called bruce willis action film project 1998 . it's competent , business-like and utterly uninspired . i suppose mercury rising deserves at least an ounce of credit for trying to make its protagonist human . nice try , bad idea . i don't know who thought it was wise to remake rain man as a gritty thriller , but it's a combination that falls completely flat . though willis is a cut above his action hero contemporaries as an actor , he still can't work miracles with a character reduced to baleful stares and hoarse whispers as he vainly struggles to befriend his troubled charge . it's not just that he has trouble connecting with simon , which is sort of the point -- he has trouble connecting with anyone . it's that kind of creative deja-vu which makes sitting through mercury rising such a chore . it's not that it's a terrible film ; in fact , director harold becker's pacing is a cut above recent genre cousins , the narrative never actively insults , and the performances are solid all the way around . mode , even gets off a sharp little inside joke when he tells a mach-posturing willis " you've been watching too many of those 4-wheel-drive commercials " ( baldwin himself being the television voice of chevy trucks ) . but those are the kind of moments you grasp for when you've seen the same film a dozen times a year for the last five years , when you've written about the same film a dozen times a year for the last five years . if your objective in watching a film like mercury rising is spending a two hour block which will immediately blur into previous two hour blocks , you've found a winner . you may even have something worth writing about it . if so , i've got a couple of column inches you could help fill . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
0	this tolerable but not particularly interesting noir film suffers from a meaningless story , lacklustre direction , and even though , it has a good cast , the two glamorous stars , robert taylor and ava gardner , seem miscast : they are too beautiful for their parts . there was no conviction felt in the two stars succumbing to their pangs of love ; they brought little to the story in the way of true cynical noir feeling , and it is only the heavies , vincent price and charles laughton , who keep the film hopping with their stock villainous portrayals . the film , badly compromised by the romantic directions it headed in , was unable to pick up steam , until the finale , where there is a splendid shootout between taylor and price amidst a fireworks display . but by that time , the story seemed too trite to really matter , and its main theme about the moral dilemma of whether taylor should accept a lot of cash to look the other way or of letting ava go even if she was guilty , because taylor fell in love with her , seemed to hardly matter . he was the only one in the film who was even remotely interesting and who , along with price , seemed to be in the right film . " the bribe " was shot in the mgm studio and has a phony look to it and enough trite dialogue in it to put a few yawns on your kisser . say it often enough and its just a sound without any meaning , anymore . " that could also describe this film , as it lost its purpose early on and never found any true meaning in its story . 
0	and the movie itself , which starts off as by far the worst kids' movie of the year , improves only marginally by the canonical big ending game . don't ask . he is either a clich ? of a mentally-deficient man for whom we are supposed to feel sorry or a hammy actor whose bad slapstick is supposed to make us laugh . we end up just feeling awkward whenever he is on the screen as he speaks in baby talk to jack . smith's performance is the only likable part of the entire movie . the nugget's practice consists of a half dozen simultaneous wrestling matches . the players are only interested in horsing around and couldn't care less if they continue to be slaughtered in every game . one kid is so bored that he knits on the ice . you'll wish that you had brought along your knitting materials to the movie . in short , the story by anne and robert vince is completely ridiculous and far from funny . the nugget's goalie is a semi-blind athlete who can't even see the puck . his name is -- you guessed it ! -- magoo . i suppose that if the mere sight of a chimp in human clothes does it for you , then you might like this movie . i've never been a fan of monkey comedies , but this is one of the worst that i've ever seen . you'll want to head for home about five minutes into mvp . i wish i could say that this movie should have gone direct to video rather than to a theatrical release , but i can't . the film stock for this movie should have gone direct into the incinerator . mvp : most valuable primate runs 1 : 33 . it is rated pg for some mild language and would be acceptable for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 11 , gave it just * 1/2 , complaining about how stupid many of the characters acted , especially the caregiver and the old man in the stands . steven's twin , john , liked the movie , giving it * * * and saying that he liked the way the movie was about hockey . 
1	honestly , if i never see another courtroom scene in a movie , it will be too soon . as soon as i see a witness stand , a couple of guys in suits , and twelve good persons and true , i know i'm in for nothing less than a good old-fashioned lecture . it's jello drama : ready instantly , but usually without much texture . murder in the first has an inherently interesting story at its core , but its makers don't know what to do with it except dress it up in cliches and impress us with cinematographic gymnastics . it's not a bad film ; it's just lazy , a classic example of a writer and director failing to make the most of an idea's potential . murder in the first opens with a risky but effective sequence which shows henri's treatment while in the " dungeon . " the sequence goes on for several minutes , but it is necessary considering how much henri's state of mind comes into play . in fact , director marc rocco doesn't really go far enough . the torture sequences are too romanticized , filmed in slow-motion and backlit like an s&m version of flashdance , when it would have been more appropriate to play the scenes straight so that henri's plight seemed more real . it is a lack of restraint typical of rocco's direction , which looks like he put cinematographer fred murphy in a gyroscope and just set him spinning . you get the impression that rocco thinks this story is basically about crane shots and funky angles . what it should have been about , first and foremost , is the relationship between henri and stamphill , but again rocco and screenwriter dan gordon don't take advantage of opportunities . it's too much a case of the tail wagging the dog , such that by the end of murder in the first i didn't feel the friendship between these two men which should have created its greatest emotional impact . that said , the scenes between bacon and slater are the best thing about murder in the first . though bacon's performance is occasionally indulgent , coming off like renfield with a midwestern twang , he is mostly extremely affecting . it is by far the meatiest role he has had , and he is effective at maintaining the shred of humanity behind henri's glassy stare . one scene in particular , in which slater compares the punishment he received for stealing five dollars to henri's , is a great piece of work because rocco lets the inherent power of the moment work . murder in the first , which should have been most about a connection between two very different men , instead becomes a shouting match , and by trying to make his film important with a capital " i , " marc rocco instead makes it mediocre with a capital " m .

2	walsh , e . g . marshall , david paymer , david hyde pierce director : oliver stone producers : clayton townsend , andrew g . vanja , and oliver stone screenplay : oliver stone , stephen j . rivele , and christopher wilkinson cinematography : robert richardson music : john williams u . s . distributor : hollywood pictures it's always a tricky proposition to make a motion picture based on recent history -- and the more public the episode , the more difficult it is for the film maker to balance drama with accuracy . this is especially true when that film maker is oliver stone , a director known more for self-aggrandizement than for the thoughtful handling of difficult issues . it's entirely because of stone's reputation that the even- handedness of nixon is such a surprise . while not an unassailable portrait of the late president , this movie at least attempts to present nixon as a human being , with all the failings and greatness inherent in a man of his stature . nixon is portrayed an neither demonic nor angelic . this is a rare occasion where stone's script is more concerned with executing a character study than pushing a political agenda . the film even ends with a touching tribute culled from nixon's funeral last year . that's not to say that stone has stuck entirely to the historical record . one wonders if stone didn't include this bit just to incite controversy and raise a few eyebrows . nixon is not a simple regurgitation of historical events . in fact , history is used primarily as the backdrop against which this character study takes place . less a biography than an impressionist's vision , the film may disappoint those expecting a vitriolic attack on someone who is surely not among stone's heroes . but the lead personae , as realized by anthony hopkins , isn't reduced to an unthinking , unfeeling caricature . while nixon is depicted as a paranoid , borderline-megalomaniac , he's also shown to have deep moral convictions , a strong sense of loyalty , and a love of his country . the drama plays out in a shakespearean fashion , with nixon's tragic flaw of hubris clearly in evidence . hopkins is not heavily made up -- and therefore doesn't really look like his character -- but his mannerisms are perfect and he is allowed a full range of facial expressions ( unlike robert duvall in stalin ) . hopkins does far more with acting than fake jowls could ever accomplish . the film's structure is disjointed , especially during the first hour , as the narrative skips back and forth through time from watergate to 1960 to the 1920s and 30s . stone is giving us a snapshot of nixon's life , but it comes in such a random and haphazard fashion that it dims the dramatic impact and dilutes early character development . it's not until the film's second hour , as nixon faces the dilemma of how to end the vietnam war , that hopkins' character starts to click . stone's penchant for bizarre cinematography damages the film more often than not . many of the odd camera angles , film stock switches , and surrealistic superimposed backdrops are distracting rather than effective . unfortunately , this has become one of stone's trademarks ; he seems unable to make a film without making some kind of statement to the effect of : " look at me ! i'm an artist ! " nixon would have been better focused without such grandstanding . there are several memorable scenes in nixon and these , along with hopkins' outstanding portrayal , keep the viewer engaged . nixon really doesn't offer any surprising insights , nor does it break new ground for the director . this is a dynamic -- if flawed -- look at the man who , for better and for worse , changed america's place in the world and its perception of itself . there are few who do not have an opinion of nixon . and , factual or not , there's no denying that nixon has moments when it is nothing short of compelling . 
2	the movie is of epic proportions , length and grandeur . mel gibson , in what i found to be his best role ever , plays the grown up wallace . gibson directs the movie as well . the story is full of fascinating history of which i knew little . i have a good english history background but was surprised at what little early scottish history i knew . the story itself is quite compelling , and the script is excellent . the political intrigue among the scottish nobles makes you wonder whose side they are on . i found myself thinking of gary cooper in the fountainhead and the similarity between his role and that of gibson's . actually , the movie most like braveheart is gettysburg for both had huge and realistic battle scenes with wave after wave of humans charging each other and dying . they are both about old scottish heroes , and in my book , braveheart wins hands down . finally , you may find yourself thinking of the judas story from the bible except here the movie has a plethora of judases . one example of the quality of the script is that the writer manages to introduce a very funny character without it seeming like merely a plot device , which of course it is . i laughed out loud many times . although there was little humor in this serious tale , there was just enough to keep me from ever tiring even though i had to stay seated for three hours . too often period pieces seem like merely exercises in style . i found queen margot to be one such movie . here the wonderful costumes and set decoration feel totally authentic but in a natural way . i felt like i was actually in the thirteenth century where people's faces were frequently dirty and in general personal hygiene was minimal . i have been to scotland many times and it is gorgeous . in a low key but quite impressive way , the cinematography makes one feel the beauty and the isolation of countryside . the music with the recurring and haunting melody of the lone scottish bagpipe sets a sad and yet serene tone and mood . braveheart runs a long , but well worth it , 2 : 52 . i would not want it shorten . it is rated r , but nc-17 would be more appropriate . it is the goriest movie i have ever seen and that too i would not change because it allows one to vicariously live through what actual battles in that period would be like . please be warned that you will see almost every part of the human body being chopped off or stabbed in one scene or another . imagine any physical horror , and there is probably a scene of it in braveheart . nevertheless , there was not one scene where i thought the violence was gratuitous . i would let older teenagers see the movie , but would be careful with impressionable younger ones . i give braveheart a strong recommendation and award it * * * 1/2 . don't miss it . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	starring : jeni courtney , mick lally , richard sheridan , eileen colgan , john lynch director : john sayles producers : sarah green and maggie renzi screenplay : john sayles based on the secret of the ron mor skerry by rosalie k . fry released by skerry movies corporation in content , setting , and cast choice , the secret of roan inish is a departure for writer/director john sayles . his intention , from the beginning , was to create a picture in which irish actors would not be given dialogue that seemed obviously written by a foreigner . and what will it take to restore the ways of the past , something which inspires equal portions of longing and dread ? geographically , sayles may be in unfamiliar territory with the secret of roan inish , but his inimitable style has been imprinted on this movie . two of the director's trademarks--the ability to tell an engrossing story and the development of strong , three-dimensional characters -- are in evidence . with roan inish , sayles has found the perfect balance between the mystical and the concrete . much like into the west , the result is exuberant and compelling . none of the actors in the secret of roan inish are likely to be familiar to american viewers . mick lally , who does a wonderful job as the grandfather , is an accomplished irish thespian whose work is rarely seen overseas . jeni courtney , another impressive child actor , has never before done a screen role . her fiery performance is as much a testimony to her talent as to sayles' direction . there's no doubt that the secret of roan inish is a most atypical motion picture , but in many ways , this is the best kind of movie -- one that takes us to a land where magic is real , and where a little girl can strive to find a lost brother and bring happiness to an entire family . the story , although straightforward , is by no means simple , and there's enough in the secret of roan inish to delight both children and adults . 
2	satyajit ray's 28th and last film , he died in 1992 , is one that he shot in radiant color , and is as close as you can come to being a masterpiece and not be one , it is much better than some of his recent films , which seemed to show his old-fashioned humanistic ideas of what a film should be like , to be in a decline with the modern theater goer's taste . this film moved me a great deal , as i found empathy with his deep feelings about the observations he has made regarding the affects of civilization . the plot is rather plain . this makes sudhindra more suspicious of him than before , as he thinks that he is certainly scholarly and articulate and well-travelled , but he might be this clever because he is really an impostor . the family has no other way of confirming in a hurry if this is really their uncle . ray's choice of traditional music and primitive folk dance numbers , especially when the uncle sees his niece dance with the women members of the santhal tribe , is pulsating to behold and a reminder to us that we shouldn't forget our roots . the opulence and warm-hearted nature of the film overcame the lack of real suspense the film had and its predictability . his light touch and simple human gestures with the camera , poured out a delightfully intellectual array of food for thought , allowing this film to be both visually entertaining and a homage to a great director's creative life , questioning and stirring up his audience to keep knowing more about themselves and the world they live in , as he leaves us with this last eloquent film , one that has his signature firmly on it . 
1	given the score's killer cast ( robert de niro , edward norton , marlon brando and angela bassett ) , you will probably be expecting a lot . start to lower your expectations , because the score plays like a slow motion version of entrapment with de niro attempting a geriatric rendition of catherine zeta-jones . still , de niro gives it his all , which is a lot more than can be said about brando , who phones in his small part . even the usually outstanding norton delivers one of his less memorable performances . bassett , playing a disapproving girlfriend , has a part that would be better cut out entirely . in a script full of fat , hers would be the first character that should go . working from a script created by no less than 4 writers ( daniel e . taylor , kario salem , lem dobbs and scott marshall smith ) , director frank oz ( bowfinger ) tries to move from comedies to thrillers . for some reason , he forgot that thrillers , especially thinly plotted ones like this one , need energy like comedies need laughs . and the writers forgot that thrillers need twists , lots of twists to keep the suspense up . expect to spend most of your time slumped back in your seat rather than on the edge of it . only the brief last act has any punch . one suspects , and hopes , that this movie will be buried at the summer box office by better movies and that the cast will go on to be seen doing much better work in future films . the score runs a long 2 : 03 . it is rated r for language and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up . my son jeffrey , age 12 , gave it * * * . he said that he liked the characters , the techniques of the robbery and plot's twists . in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
2	sometimes you are fortunate to see something so special and unusual that you have trouble writing about it . kenneth branagh's new hamlet affected me that way . every time i picked up my notes to finish writing about it , i would switch to some other review instead . ( during the christmas season , there are so many films opening that i stay behind . sometimes i even have three press screenings at once . you can see why the new york times needs three film critics to cover all the movies . ) so why is there all this buzz about yet another adaptation of william shakespeare's " hamlet " ? afterall , there have been twenty-eight hamlet movies already . surely there is no longer anything new to say . four hours plus a twenty minute intermission to be precise . granted , that for those who hate shakespeare , the idea of sticking around this long will sound like masochism . yet , even people not enamored with the bard may be as blown away by this film as was i . let me explain . branagh chose the film's length for two reasons . first , he wanted to break with tradition and do a full text version of the play . this means that viewers would get to enjoy the many minor scenes that directors eliminate because of time considerations . second , he wanted to allow enough time for the play to breathe . this is the groundbreaking idea that makes the play so uniquely accessible . hamlet has more lines worth pondering than ten other plays , but usually the listener can not pause to reflect on them because the actors are flying through their lines so they can get the movie completed within a traditional length . never i have i understood or appreciated hamlet so completely , and i predict that others fortunate enough to see the movie in its full four hour length will feel the same way . there is much history behind the running time . let me summarize what i heard about it . branagh wanted a four hour version , but the distributors and the theater owners thought it would be a financial disaster for them . normally they could fill the theater twice during that period . moreover , the shorter version will be a 35mm print , whereas the longer will be the original 70mm . we were supposed to see the 70mm four hour version , but the print was " stuck in london , " so we saw a 35mm print of the four hour version instead . like sergio leone's once upon a time in america ( 1984 ) , which has both a truncated and a full length version , the longer one is the one is see . i would drive hours to see the four hour version of hamlet . given there was a massive storm the day i saw it , that is exactly what i did and was it ever worth it . this adaptation of the play is set in the nineteenth century . the exterior scenes were shot at blenheim palace where they used more artificial snow than any movie in history . yes , even more than doctor zhivago . ( the press kit assures us that it is " environmentally friendly " fake snow so you needn't be troubled by that while watching the picture . ) the music by patrick doyle ( sense and sensibility and henry v ) has a haunting and lovely theme as well as dramatic parts full of kettle drums , horns , and wailing choirs . beautifully sad and majestic music so memorable that you may want to buy the cd , the cinematography by alex thomson makes you feel the warmth of the interior and the cold of the exterior . branagh said he did not want " gloomy castles and dour costumes , " and his crew delivered . the sets are as inviting as the text is compelling . branagh is my favorite shakespearean actor and director . anyone doubting his abilities should see his brilliant henry v , which remains his best acting ever . branagh brings an intensity and a focused approach that illuminates every word he speaks . nay it is ; i know not 'seems . ' " his thin lips quiver as he delivers the lines , and he appears as if he may explode at any moment . every actor puts his stamp on shakespeare's most famous lines , " to be , or not to be . " he delivers the speech in a mirror with the camera focused on the mirrored imaged rather than directly on him . as is appropriate , branagh is the star about which the other performers revolve . appropriate both because of his position in the play and because of his talent . nevertheless , the other luminaries in this star studded sky are worth mention and perhaps some oscar consideration . branagh says he purposely cast the film with a host of big names to ensure the audience can " look and see and hear with greater clarity " even the minor roles . i want to get the one exception to this rule out of the way quickly since it is my only criticism of the film . luckily , lemmon has only a few minutes of screen time . the rest of the actors range from quite good to exceptional . besides those already mentioned , derek jacobi gives a controlled and effective reading of the malevolent claudius . interesting choice since jacobi's signature role was as emperor claudius in " i , claudius . " that performance left an indelible mark on his memory of how the play was so " exciting , sexy , dangerous , and violent . " kate winslet ( heavenly creatures , sense and sensibility , and jude ) delivers the best performance of her short but talented career as the fragile and vulnerable ophelia . when ophelia goes mad , you believe it . charlton heston and rosemary harris are perfectly cast as the player king and queen . robin williams is quite funny in the small part of osric , but billy crystal underplays the comic role of the first gravedigger . an incredible motion picture experience . movies this good remind us of the power of the medium . see the four hour version . and try to see the 70mm version that i missed . 70mm gives images a three dimensional realism that the smaller 35mm format can never bring out . i have trouble imagining a more striking visual that the 35mm print i saw . you could see something even better . it is rated pg-13 . there is brief sex , some nudity , and violence . the film would fine for kids say nine or ten and up . i recommend this film to you in the strongest terms whether you like shakespeare or hate him , and i give it my top rating of * * * * . do not miss this film . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	to viewers of comedy central and pbs , rowan atkinson is a familiar face . bean . while bean branches out from the format developed for the television series , it remains faithful to the concepts and constructs that led to its success . part of the reason for this is the involvement of screenwriters richard curtis and robin driscoll , who collaborated on most of the tv episodes . viewers of vintage films will recognize a little of charlie chaplin in atkinson's portrayal . both carrey and atkinson share a fondness for screwball , physical comedy and possess the ability to contort their features into seemingly-impossible expressions , although atkinson's apparently-reserved demeanor makes him seem funnier than carrey . the second is giving the normally-silent title character a few more lines than usual . by his standards , bean is positively loquacious here , making a speech , and , at one point , even being told to " be quiet . " the third , which is a mistake , is attempting to develop the supporting characters beyond their natural roles as victims of mr . bean's blundering . it doesn't work . those individuals , like the plot itself , are throwaways . although bean contains a fair share of bathroom humor , flatulence jokes , and assorted gags featuring bodily fluids , not everything is lowbrow , and this is an aspect that differentiates it from the likes of ace ventura : pet detective . the script contains instances of dry wit , such as detailing the merchandising plans of the grierson gallery for " whistler's mother " ( it's reminiscent of the my dinner with andre action figures from waiting for guffman ) , and some biting dialogue ( bean's description of the painting's subject : " a hideous old bat who looks like she's got a cactus lodged up her backside " ) . this storyline is basically just a setup for a series of variably funny comedy skits . the episodic nature of the narrative leads to some hilarious sequences and a few dull patches . overall , things seem a little stretched out , making it clear that a 30-minute tv slot is a better length for mr . bean than a 90-minute feature film . by the end of bean , the talented atkinson begins to wear out his welcome , and the rest of the cast -- a predominantly lifeless group of actors -- offers little support . despite several side-splitting scenes ( bean's bathroom antics , bean in an amusement park , bean stuffing a turkey , bean examining " whistler's mother " ) , the comedy in the film is too uneven to justify the length . thanks to atkinson , bean is a pleasant diversion , but it's far from the comic masterpiece sought after by bean aficionados and novices alike . " for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake . " 
1	starring : robert deniro , kenneth branagh , helena bonham carter . screenplay : steph lady and frank darabont . director : kenneth branagh . in the first place , this is * not * mary shelley's frankenstein . as iconic and thematically fascinating as shelley's novel might be , it is unfilmable as written , a rambling piece more notable for long philosophical musings than for any action one would consider cinematically ideal . no , while this version may be more faithful than most , it is really kenneth branagh's frankenstein , and therein lies its crucial failing . while ostensibly attempting to stay close to shelley's often tedious narrative , branagh is more frequently indulging his bombastic filmmaking style , giving us the gee-whiz camera work of dead again without any of that film's sense of fun . there are a truckload of bad decisions involved in mary shelley's frankenstein , but the most glaring might be branagh casting himself as the good mad doctor . as talented a shakespearean stage actor as he is , he is also a shakespearean stage actor on film . victor frankenstein is a character defined by torment , but branagh's version of torment often consists of howling and tearing at his hair . the screenplay by steph lady and frank darabont does far too little to establish the oedipal subtext which is the basis for frankenstein's obsession , making branagh's reaction to his mother's death look comically overboard . when nearly a full hour goes by before the creature plays a significant role , frankenstein's characterization needs to be developed more consistently and subtly , and branagh can't pull it off . he also seems to direct that first hour without any thought of the audience . it's true that he's dealing with a script that leap-frogs over twenty years in the first ten minutes , but branagh's editing choices are baffling . the opening sequence , which takes place on a ship in the arctic , is so loud and fast that it borders on the incoherent ; the next twenty minutes are a crashing bore . frankenstein always looks impressive , particularly the mammoth stairway of the frankenstein manor which seems to take on a life of its own , but until the creation sequence branagh spends an awful lot of time doing precious little but creating atmosphere as precociously as possible . the creation sequence does signal a significant improvement in frankenstein , and that is largely due to the surprisingly expressive performance of robert deniro as the creature . even under mounds of gruesome latex , deniro gives the creature an interior life , and some of the scenes which focus on his interaction with a peasant family are extremely touching . but he is frequently failed by branagh's direction , because branagh doesn't want to concentrate on the story's philosophical underpinnings--he wants to film an opera . there are moments of undeniable power in mary shelley's frankenstein , including a horrifying sequence involving the creation of a bride for the creature , and they are so strong that they almost make up for the flotsam between them . unfortunately , for the most part frankenstein the movie ends up a lot like the creature itself : alternately lumbering and chaotic , and a patchwork mess . 
2	sphere , the latest michael crichton novel to be brought to the screen , is a physical and psychological thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat . barry levinson , the director of the excellent and topical movie wag the dog as well as his academy award winning rain man , brings just the right blend of fast-paced action sequences and slower mental exercises . using some of the same scientific deduction techniques as last year's contact , the movie involves your brains as well as your emotions . good film critics develop a sense of what is enough to tell their readers about a movie to give them a feel for it without giving away key plot twists . sphere tests the abilities of critics since several elements of the story that are best left unmentioned are so central to the critique of the movie . i will , as always , try to strike the right balance and in the case of sphere probably give away much less than other reviewers since it is the delight of the surprise that makes this movie so interesting and involving . full names are mandatory in such situations . continuing with her recent movie tradition , stone has no romantic scenes of any kind . the script interlaces just enough humor with the terror to keep from exhausting the audience . " atheist , but i'm flexible , " norman replies with a nervous laughter . the best parts of the movie are not the scary parts , of which several had me jumping in my seat , but the ones where they spend the time to consider the scientific implications of what is happening . he reasons that an alien with emotions is a scary proposition since beings that are happy can turn angry just as easily . with headings like chapters of a book the movie races to its conclusion . as the tension ratchets up , the film has trouble sustaining its momentum . by the last half hour , the picture begins to bog down , and it ends in its hokiest scene of all . i would love to know what the changes were . please drop me a line if you know . ) even though they lose it somewhat in end , the film has so much intelligence and energy than it is well worth seeing . ( there i did it . i got through the whole review without even mentioning the sphere itself , among many other things . it is rated pg-13 for sci-fi action and scary scenes and would be fine for kids around eleven and up , depending upon how prone they are to nightmares . 
2	screenplay : richard kwietniowski , based on the novel by gilber adair . director : richard kwietniowski . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 90 minutes . a widowed british author who studiously avoids all things modern -- or , more precisely , all things _period_ -- de'ath has recently had a completely inadvertent life-changing experience . i'm sure that message was not meant specifically for film critics , but it's a shoe which may fit anyway . much of the humor in the first half of love and death -- and this is , it should be clear , a very sharp comedy -- comes from de'ath's embarassment over the object of his interest . the whole business seems even more shameful to a man of letters who should know better than to watch a film described in a critical summary as having " no redeeming qualities whatsoever . " it's the whole idea of a " guilty pleasure " which love and death takes to task . when he launches into a tangent on film acting at a lecture , he may simply be swooning over ronnie , but he is also attacking a subject with a passion . as perfectly geared towards satire as the phony films-within-a-film may be ( complete with familiar grainy photography and credits like " a huck murphy film " ) , you're forced to move past mocking giggles to acknowledging the genuinely intense response de'ath feels . the credit for that belongs largely to john hurt , who gives a career performance . it's a role which must be perfectly pitched to be sympathetic , because de'ath is , to be frank , a celebrity stalker . hurt makes de'ath absolutely sincere , even if he is the only one who could possibly see greatness in ronnie . such epiphanies are too rare to restrict to the places we're _supposed_ to find epiphanies . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
2	cast : emmanuelle beart , michel serrault , jean-hugues anglade , claire nadeau , francoise brion , michele laroque , michel lonsdale , charles berling , jean-pierre lorit director : claude sautet producer : alain sarde screenplay : claude sautet , jacques fieschi , and yves ulmann cinematography : jean-francois robin music : philippe sarde there's a line near the end of nelly & monsieur arnaud that , for me , sums up the entire movie : " we all want love , but when we find it , we pull back . it scares us . " claude sautet's feature is about the mysteries of the human heart and mind , and , while it doesn't pack the same emotional power as his 1992 film , un coeur en hiver , it deals with many of the same subjects in an equally intelligent manner . some complain that sautet's films are too intellectual , but , like eric rohmer , the film maker uses conversation to delve deeply into the core of his characters . you don't start out feeling much for the men and women who populate his films , but , by the final reel , you empathize with them all . in nelly & monsieur arnaud , sautet injects the finale with a bitter dash of irony -- it's an unexpected twist that underscores his main theme . nelly & monsieur arnaud is as close to a perfectly-acted motion picture as is likely to be found . emmanuelle beart ( manon of the spring , mission impossible ) , one of today's most attractive and accomplished french actresses , emotes as much with her eyes and gestures as with her words . there's a scene where the slight cock of her head gives a poignant negative answer to the question , " are you happy ? " her co-star , michel serrault , matches her scene-for-scene with a towering performance of often restrained , but occasionally unleashed , passion . it's easy to see nelly & monsieur arnaud as a may/december romance , but it's more than that . it's about longing for the forbidden fruit , shielding oneself from disappointment , and holding back from the thing most wanted . sautet's film was nominated for a ton of cesar awards . it won two : best director for sautet and best actor for serrault . both are deserved . this is a leisurely , compelling look at emotions that are common to all human beings . there are times when nelly & monsieur arnaud seems a little sterile , and several secondary relationships don't consistently engage the audience . but when beart and serrault are together on screen , they make the most unusual kind of magic . these are two great actors giving top-notch performances , and the restrained romance they project is fascinating . it's this quality , more than any other , that makes nelly & monsieur arnaud a rewarding motion picture .

" ) with so many players off to fight , however , the talent was thin . the mets had the worst initial season of any 20th century baseball team . baseball's most glaring fault is that it's too long . much too long . certain segments seem to drag interminably with little in the way of color added to the basic historical regurgitation . most of what this series has to offer can be gleaned from a good book on the sport . the analysis is rarely penetrating and the visual elements are typically stale . the moments when baseball shines are too often sandwiched around stretches of dry , straightforward documentary presentation . almost equally disappointing is the film's treatment of the modern era . burns' examination of the '70s and '80s is a spotty , hit-and-miss affair that creates few memorable impressions . baseball is at its strongest when it focuses on one of its three primary themes . the film demonstrates the elasticity of the game's appeal , and you get a sense that no matter how immediately crippling the current players' strike is , the sport will eventually overcome it . the examination of baseball's approach to segregation ( before the mid-'40s ) and integration ( thereafter ) is handled in a thought-provoking and thorough manner . burns' probing of the role of blacks in the sport--both in the negro leagues and later in the major leagues--represents one of the most insightful filmed approaches to the subject . inexplicably , however , the work stoppages of the '70s and '80s are not mentioned . fans in other parts of the country may at times feel slighted , however . and boston , other than being burns' favorite team , is hardly worthy of the amount of exposure it receives . based on relative screen time , one would have to conclude that casey stengel was a more important figure than connie mack , and yogi berra was of greater significance than steve carlton , lou brock , and mike schmidt combined . burns' civil war style of combining photographs with " talking heads , " period music , and voiceover quotes doesn't work as well in baseball , perhaps because the emotional resonance achieved here doesn't match that of stories of a nation torn by war . by the middle of the series , film clips are replacing still photographs , making this documentary's overall format seem more traditional than that of its predecessor . the are several noteworthy " recreations " of partial or entire games . in the end , a non-baseball fan who sticks with this movie for its entirety is likely to learn a lot about the sport and its history , and perhaps gain an understanding of why it inspires such passion in so many people . and every viewer , devotee or not , is herein given the opportunity to appreciate the unique synergy between the progress of the game and american history . baseball is a canvas painted with broad strokes and little detail . burns has invested an incredible amount of effort and passion into a project that is by turns insightful , nostalgic , pedantic , and ( unfortunately ) occasionally dull . " i actually think [baseball] still is at the center of our lives in this country . oh , it has periods when it seems to be eclipsed . but baseball has so inserted itself into the american soul . its strength is uniting people , generation after generation . it's suffering from an anxiety about itself . and you know what ? knowing your own history is the best antidote to that confusion .

0	benedict heinrich , head of a fascist government ) - are in a horror film that shows little affinity for the genre and apart from a few scares , this is a rather tepid effort put forth by the director . scream and scream again was based on peter saxon's novel 'the disoriented man , ' but it is the story that seems out of whack rather than the title . these are the quirky characteristics found throughout the film that makes its humor rather odd and might appeal to certain fans of this genre . the result is a race of emotionless and mindless androids . the film ends with a cryptic warning by fremont that all is not over with yet . this muddled story is not supposed to make sense and it doesn't , it is supposed to shock your senses and if you were thusly shocked , i suppose you got your money's worth out of this b- film . there is no real character study accomplished . the dialogue ranged from being trite to being ludicrous . overall , this was a weakly crafted film that probably has brought to the surface enough undeveloped ideas in it , to make it a somewhat bearable film to view during parts of it and a film that fans of the three horror stars should want to see , if for no other reason but for that alone . 
2	watching almost famous by writer/director cameron crowe ( jerry maguire ) is like enjoying one of those old vinyl lps that are collecting dust in your closet . as you kick back , you can remember your younger days , while listening to some great rock 'n' roll . in an inspired bit of casting , patrick fugit , a kid with sweetly penetrating eyes and an androgynous bowl haircut , plays william . whether anyone will take this boyish figure as a real critic seems questionable at best . -- which he never does -- as she is to say , " i love you . " the good-spirited script softens elaine's image so that we find her a strong , lovable character and not merely a clich ? . lester tells william that it's too bad he missed rock's heyday and that it's all over now . he generously gives william his first assignment -- a small piece writing about black sabbath . " and the chicks are great , right ? " traveling with clearwater are girls that call themselves " band-aids " rather than groupies since they don't have " sex " with band members , just oral sex -- where have we heard that one before ? crudup , who frequently seems so serious in his parts that you wonder if he's having any fun , clearly gets a kick out of his role this time . russell knows that no matter how innocent william looks , he could still be the enemy if he writes something that trashes the band or reveals too many secrets . russell's a trippy philosopher ( " in 11 years , it will be 1984 -- think about it . " ) , who is more profound sober than stoned . the music is great , the concert footage is energetic and john toll's cinematography is luscious . a completely entertaining film , it manages to find a cathartic way to wrap it all up . and it makes this film critic a bit jealous since william's assignment is like the job of a lifetime . almost famous runs 2 : 04 . it is rated r for language , drug content and brief nudity and would be acceptable for most teenagers . 
2	united kingdom , 1995 running length : 1 : 45 mpaa classification : no mpaa /96 , 5/7/96 , and 5/11/96 cast : freddie findlay , aled roberts , andrew lusher , lisa faulkner , christopher lee , robert hardy , edward fox director : justin hardy producers : yoshi nishio screenplay : justin hardy and yoshi nishio cinematography : tim maurice-jones a feast at midnight is a delightfully comic family film that celebrates youthful rebellion . taking place within the cloistered walls of a british boys' school , the story seems somehow removed from time , invoking images from dickens' novels as often as it pulls a term from jurassic park . dryden park is the kind of place where dozens of serious dramas are set ( most about repression and abuse ) , yet co-writer/director justin hardy has something lighter in mind , playing with the dreary " boys' school image " while allowing his narrative to progress in a more upbeat fashion . since it's a family tradition to attend stuffy dryden park , that's where magnus is enrolled . stories about children rebelling against authority are typically grim affairs , and often involve a great deal of melodrama . not so in a feast at midnight , where the unlikely method is the act of cooking , and the medium is decidedly comic . his innocent face and unaffected manner make magnus completely believable . he's a pleasure to watch , and his performance never strikes a wrong chord . equally enchanting is lisa faulkner , who exhibits great appeal in playing an ugly duckling-turned-beautiful girl . while never letting his stern expression slip , lee pokes fun at the grotesque , monstrous image that established his reputation . hardy lampoons everything from masterpiece theater-type dramas to american tv and motion pictures . a feast at midnight is one of those rare family films that offers as much ( if not more ) for adults than children . the way to an audience's heart may be through its stomach , but a feast at midnight provides a delectable , alternative means of entry . 
0	something that is more real than the computer games he is hooked on . the film can't seem to be told without the voiceover from leonardo dicaprio , explaining his thought process and what's going on . he seemed like a much nicer bloke than richard . . . but such is life ! the beach is the real star of the film , as the cinematography of it is scintillating . the film itself wasn't a bad film , as much as it was an empty one . there is just very little to digest here . the slight story is a predictable one , as the drug-dealing farmers mean business , so when richard's four unwanted acquaintances arrive , we know what response to expect from the farmers . it made for some beautiful fantasy shots via computer graphics , but added nothing to the film's story . the film concludes as a lesson that there is no such thing as a paradise on earth , and if there were , it wouldn't remain one for long because man's desires are far-reaching . so it's back to virtual reality for the dicaprio character , after all , the theme of the film seems to imply , maybe that's not so bad a thing to be doing with your life . in an interview he gave for cable tv , he said he didn't mind that this hollywood film took some liberties with his story to juice it up sexually so we can see leonardo romance the beautiful virginie ledoyen and have another affair with tilda swinton , additions that were not part of the novel . the photography of that underwater kiss with ledoyen was sensational , as they were lit up like christmas trees from the opalescent plant life that surrounded them . the romance itself had no sparkles in it . overrated director , danny boyle ( " a life less ordinary " / " trainspotting " / " shallow grave " ) , is skilled at working his magic on films that are basically insubstantial by relying on non-narrative things to do the job , such as the energy from the actors and the beauty in his visual sets . here , he is aided by the wonderfully gifted cinematographer , darius khondji , who makes the beach look like a cross between the figment of one's psychedelic dream and an ongoing computer game , something you can't take your eyes off . it was just too bad that the story didn't have more weight to it , or should i say some weight to it , because this film played mostly like a travelogue . don't blame the actors for what went wrong here , they did their job the best they could . the fault is all in the script .

1	wyatt earp is an epic of a movie made on a grand scale . kevin costner plays wyatt earp from age 20 on . i know that seriously dates me . this is a classic lawrence kasdan movie . he produced , directed , and wrote it . kasdan likes important films that make statements . here he makes a movie full of sweeping grandeur and absolutely wonderful dramatic music ( james newton howard ) that never stops . demille would have the loved it . costner is always interesting to watch , and he is in this movie . with the exception of dennis quaid , the other performances are fine , but nothing special . quaid was badly miscast . for a better doc holiday see the quirkier but fascinating performance by val kilmer in tombstone . wyatt earp is rated pg-13 for a fair amount of blood . teenagers will be fine at it , but keep the little ones away . it runs an incredible 3 : 10 , but feels more like four hours . it got * * from me and a mild thumbs down . if they would have cut out an hour , i could have boosted my rating to * * 1/2 and recommended it , but as it is , i give it a thumbs down . in fact , if they lightened up a bit and did not treat every scene like it was the parting of the red sea , i probably would have even given another 1/2 star . if you go see it , you will leave very tired , but will have some beautiful scenes to remember . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : july 2 , 1994 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	shiloh , a sad but lovable little beagle and one of the cutest dogs around , is back for his second movie in shiloh 2 : shiloh season , a direct-to-video sequel to shiloh , a movie that two years ago garnered so much critical acclaim . the new story about the power of " a little bit of kindness " is full of old-fashioned values and homespun wisdom . it tries hard to teach without being preachy . some of the cast is back from the original , but many are new . dale rosenbloom again writes the script , this time based on the second in phyllis reynolds naylor's shiloh trilogy , which means that we can probably expect a shiloh 3 . he's also a tobacco spitter , which can be pretty gross on the screen and thoroughly defines his character . whereas most kids' movies suffer from having villains that aren't real , judd , a wiry loner , is exactly the explosive type of individual who is so scary in real life . " some people never change , and judd's one of them , " he decides at one point , tired of trying hard to be kind to judd without receiving any positive response from him . generally , adults populate the story to provide prepackaged bits of wisdom for marty to ponder and act upon . " sometimes you get a streak of bad luck that you can't do anything about , and sometimes you get a streak of bad luck that's your own fault , " doc tells marty about the troubles judd has had to face in his life . she tries to show them that even the lowest of the low , like judd , should be judged only on what they know for sure and certain and have seen with their own eyes . of course , marty has personally witnessed how wicked judd can be , but the teacher's point is a good one nevertheless . the movie , which plays like a good episode of a television series , is filled with strong moral lessons if not as much action or interest as it needs . ( small but irritating production mistakes mar its presentation . one of the key nighttime scenes , for example , is lit as bright as day . ) predictable but honest , it just doesn't pack the emotional wallop of the original . still , for a pleasant family film with likeable characters and a moral message around every corner , shiloh 2 fills the bill . it is rated pg for mild thematic elements and would be fine for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 10 , called it " such a sweet little movie " and gave it * * * 1/2 . normally quiet during a movie , he kept speaking up during this one to say how good it was . 
2	in the world of animated feature films , only one production company has managed to come close to the standard set by disney--the one headed by don bluth . fortunately , thumbelina breaks this non-disney trend , presenting a theatrical experience that is lively and enjoyable for both children and adults . disneys animated movies have a threefold strength : the quality of the animation , the energy of the songs , and the clarity of the plot . in all of these areas , thumbelina is close , but not quite up to the level of the little mermaid , the weakest of disney's recent entries . the animation is crisp and visually striking , with careful attention paid to details--a trademark of both bluth and disney . thumbelina is perhaps not as completely-realized as arielle , belle , or jasmine , but she's far better drawn than the women populating all the fringe big-screen cartoons . barry manilow's music isn't as immediately recognizable as that of alan menken , but he does manage a worthy tune or two . one song in particular , " let me be your wings " , co-written by manilow with bruce sussman and jack feldman ( who partnered with menken for disney's live-action newsies ) , is a standout , and every bit the equal of beauty and the beast's title track or aladdin's " a whole new world . " the storyline of thumbelina , adapted from the popular hans christian andersen fable , is relatively uncomplicated , and makes excellent material for an animated romance/adventure . there are several occasions when the plot seems rushed , especially towards the end . while children most likely won't notice this , adults will , although it shouldn't detract much from anyone's enjoyment of the film . the vocal talents of several well-known actors are made use of in thumbelina . carol channing is ms . fieldmouse . entertainment comes in many forms , and thumbelina is among the frothiest available . but the best thing is that not only is it fun--an eminently watchable--but it's a perfect " family film , " capable of pleasing both children and their parents . with the exception of disney fare , this has become an increasingly-rare commodity , and when an opportunity such as this occurs , it should be taken advantage of . 
1	this film must have given lead actor donald sutherland a sense of deja vu . unfortunately , his second exploration of the scenario isn't nearly as good as his first , 1978's creepy invasion of the body snatchers . the creatures , which bear a remarkable resemblance to the face-suckers from the alien movies , have come to earth on a mission of conquest ( at least that's the loose impression that the picture gives--it's not too concerned about motivation ) . director stuart orme's film is fast-paced , apparently more concerned with the action elements of the story than the science fiction ones--not that these are neglected entirely . one of the most fascinating portions of the puppet masters involves an autopsy done on a creature . this scene has a sense of authenticity that is often missing from the rest of the largely comic book-style adventure . attempts at detailed characterization don't work particularly well , and there's a love story that feels as forced as it is superfluous--although even that isn't as unnecessary as the film's final ten minutes . the tactic of having a " second ending " ( a technique that is used often , but rarely accomplished well ) is misplaced in the puppet masters , especially since it includes the movie's only incident of obviously inferior visual effects work . it's refreshing to have a human hero who seems to be on top of the situation . the puppet masters is not a science fiction classic , but it is solidly entertaining . the movie is not so cliche-riddled that is seems hopelessly familiar , nor is it burdened with a complex plot that requires an unpleasant exertion of brain power to unravel . as a halloween season release , this movie delivers exactly what's most desired : cheap thrills . 
1	sternberg had a different vision for the film and after the opening chaotic scenes were told like a straight crime story , the director changed the reality of the silent film and abandoned hecht's version . sternberg gave this film a blend of realism , german expressionism and hollywood sentimentality . this works out fine , as bull is even more successful than before and becomes the uncrowned king of the chicago underworld . bull was portrayed as a burly , physical man with complex emotions . he always wanted to elevate feathers in stature and enjoyed doing it in a crass way , as he gave her jewelry as presents . that he could be generous as well as ruthless and had a laugh that could fill a room with his giant personality , made him a villain who was not one-dimensional . during its time this was an edgy film , but the times have changed and its story doesn't hold up as well today . it's a film that is mostly interesting for its historical contribution to cinema , as it set the conventions for this genre . it is also a visually challenging film , as sternberg filled the screen with symbols and imagery it had never seen before . this changed the way gangster films were made , and the visuals of this film are still considered to be innovative and stylish . some critics have classified this as an example of film noir mainly because of all the alienation and corruption shown . it's not like the film noir of the 1940s , but more like a noir predecessor . interestingly enough , at the first academy awards ceremony in 1929 , the film received its only award , for story writer ben hecht .

0	magic in the water is a boring oreo cookie commercial billed as a feature-length movie for kids . nearly split my side i was laughing so hard at that long series of jokes . the whole script by icel massey and rick stevenson is firmly based in boredom with a little stupidity and cliches thrown in every now and then for variety . among one of the many typical lines is joshua's who describes his camping goals as " i'm doing the man thing here . study death in the face . stuff like that . " don't you wish you had children so eloquent ? the premise of the movie is a recycling of the loch ness monster tale . the therapy sessions are a direct rip off from that equally awful movie , color of night , staring bruce willis . if you are going to copy , copy the worse i guess . orky , whose diet is almost exclusively the insides of oreo cookies , is arguably the most pathetic recent example of special effects . the effect is anything but special . in the water he is a small toy that you could buy for fifty cents . out of the water only his head moves , and his head looks like a piece of blubber which moves like molasses . too bad this movie was not made as a parody . harley jane kozak has had small parts in many other movies . and last , but not least , what did first time director , rick stevenson , think he was doing ? there is a medicine man that wanders through some of the scenes at random . sometimes there is talk of a toxic waste dump . the writers seem to throw in a little bit of everything in the hopes that something will work . although magic in the water is ridiculous , it still manages to scare the kids needlessly in some of the scenes . finally , the ending is an unstructured mess . surprise . surprise . it is rated pg for a few frightening scenes and a little profanity . i recommend one mile as a safe distance , i . e . , i recommend that neither you nor any of your family get within one mile of this movie . if dying of boredom was possible , this movie would be lethal . i do not give it any stars . avoid it at all costs . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	hey , if she smells like beef vegetable soup , that's a good enough reason . a good indication that this movie didn't work for me is that i never cared whether or not nancy travis' harriet was an axe murderer . the characters--and it's not just her's--are so paper-thin that it doesn't make a difference who lives or dies , and who does the killing . there isn't enough life in these people even to consider them caricatures . mysteries are supposed to be complex , intriguing , and beguiling , with the audience unsure of the truth until the very end . in fact , the solution is so obviously telegraphed that it's possible to have the answer fifteen minutes into the movie . of course , given the number of logical flaws in the resolution , it's a safe bet that you won't have gotten everything right . it's impossible to predict things that don't make sense . so , having established that there's no reason to care for the characters and that the murder mystery plot is as feeble as they come , that leaves only the comedy to comment on . as i've said before , any movie can overcome flaws if it's funny enough . john cleese's a fish called wanda is an excellent example of this . not only is the humor banal , it's only fitfully amusing . for every joke that works , there are half a dozen that fall flat . apparently mike myers thinks he's a lot funnier than he actually is . the whole scottish shtick with charlie's father ( also played by myers ) wears thin quickly , but myers keeps pushing it long after it's ceased to elicit more than forced chuckles . there are three nice cameos in the film . arkin is only in a few scenes , so there's not enough time for the gag to get overused . excepting perhaps leslie nielsen , few actors do deadpan better than hartman . there's nothing in so i married an axe murderer to make this film worthwhile entertainment . it's about as unspectacular a production as there is , with the typical level of juvenile comedy that the writer , director , and actors think is funnier than those stuck in a theater watching the picture . sneak previews of so i married an axe murderer paired this movie with weekend at bernie's 2 . the thought of sitting through these films back-to-back makes me shudder . one at a time is bad enough , but both in four hours ? not much better , but an improvement nonetheless . faint praise indeed , considering the competition . 
0	" god , i love methamphetamines -- more than life itself , " confesses ex-tv child star francesca lansfield ( sarah jessica parker ) . scott winant , who was one of the directors of the tv series " my so-called life , " directs 'til there was you . filmed by bobby bukowski in shades of pastel , the movie tries hard , too hard , to be a whimsical , romantic comedy . i've never seen winant's television work , but this movie , winant's first theatrical film , arrived doa at the screening , and his direction as well as the disastrous script by winnie holzman were the culprits . i spent most of the movie staring at the screen in disbelief . the dialog is little more than a collection of snippets of meaningless small talk , and the direction is so muddled that it takes quite a while to sort out what is happening and who is who . the bad news is that when the story does become clear , you will not care . midway through the movie , in a scene with gwen's dad ( michael tucker ) , it looks momentarily as if the film will finally get its footing . her dad , who manages to be both funny and the only believable character in the film , bursts gwen's bubble . " i'm going to tell you something important , " he says while munching candy . " i never loved your mother . she was shocked , and so was i , but then the film went right back to its plastic characters and her dad vanished . ( you can almost hear the director screaming , " get him off my set ; he's not whimsical . " ) perhaps most offensive is the story's attitude toward smoking . it is way cool . you half expected to see a joe camel ad in the closing credits . it used after sex and even instead of sex -- complete with heavy , erotic panting . to complement the film's painfully slow pacing , the unrelenting music by terence blanchard and miles goodman has a staccato piano that will begin to feel like water torture . i felt like the music was trying brainwash me into believing the film's drivel through the music's repetitive romantic rhythms , which had all of the charm of a stuck record needle . " surrounded by rude french people should bring us closer together . " with dialog like this why did the producers go forward with this project ? the movie needs a rewrite and a new director . the cast would work if it had reasonable material . 'til there was you runs 1 : 44 . the film is rated pg-13 for language , sexual suggestions and drug references . the picture is remarkably tame and would be fine for kids 10 and over , but why bother ? i recommend you avoid the film , and i give it a single star for a good cast trapped in awful movie . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	the harshness and dreariness of the story is so pervasive , filled with so much pathos and heart wrenching evil , that it takes a great director such as rivette , to bring life and breath to the soul of the film , to keep out any superfluous material to this already startling story . rivette has made a memorable film , a grand and mesmorizing film , one that towers over other such benign hollywood films relating to this subject matter . her tragic plight is a powerful story , told with perfection of style and purpose , a story that is hard to put out of your mind . 
2	contact is likely to change a lot of perceptions -- not only about the role of humankind in the universe , but about what special effects can do for a movie when they're used in the service of a story , rather than the other way around . contact is that rare big-budget motion picture that places ideas , characters , and plot above everything else . the film takes the richness of astronomer carl sagan's bestselling 1985 novel and re-invents it for the screen , retaining all the power and fascination of the book while adding a visual aspect that will not disappoint devoted fans . contact is as close as recent hollywood productions have come to a perfect example of cinema . all the elements are not only in place , but effectively realized . this is the kind of motion picture that restores one's faith in what can be produced when a large budget is used wisely . the participation of a superlative cast and crew doesn't always guarantee success , but , in this case , the high expectations have been met . the film is directed and co-produced by robert zemeckis , whose last effort was 1994's box office smash , forrest gump . as an on-again/off-again amateur astronomer , one of the first things i noticed about the film was its technical accuracy . this is undoubtedly the result of sagan's influence . all the details are correct ( at least as far as i was able to determine ) ; there are none of the movie cop-outs that film makers occasionally resort to in order to lower the intelligence level of the script . contact is believable in part because it doesn't replace true science with vague terms and gobbledygook . in his novel , sagan was careful to make everything , even the most farfetched parts , theoretically feasible . although the movie changes and condenses significant aspects of the original material , it remains true to this vision . contact opens with an unforgettable sequence that takes the viewer on a tour of the universe . it starts out in a familiar corner of space , with earth filling the screen . it's an amazing trip that only takes several minutes , but presages the wonders that contact's final half-hour holds for the viewer . although contact is rightfully being billed as the story of humanity's first encounter with an extraterrestrial life form , at its heart , it's really more about ellie and her quest for meaning in life . in her own words : " for as long as i can remember , i've been searching for some reason why we're here -- what we're doing here , who are we ? " ellie's trajectory places her on a collision course with answers to those questions , and it's the development of her character , and the resolution of this particular aspect of the story , that makes for a satisfying conclusion . in the end , the science fiction elements become subordinate to the personal ones . in its own unique way , contact offers a little bit of almost everything : drama , romance , suspense , and science fiction . it touches the emotions and the intellect . there are glorious special effects , wonderful acting , and a couple of impressive pyrotechnic displays . the plot contains the most believable approach to this subject matter ever presented in a movie . as he did in forrest gump , robert zemeckis makes excellent use of special effects . the standout sequences are those that take place in deep space and give us an awe-inspiring perception of how incredibly vast the universe is . but digital trickery , both subtle and obvious , is used on other occasions , as well . by carefully editing clips of clinton speeches and using a little creative dubbing , zemeckis makes it seem like the president is directly addressing the specific situations that arise during the course of contact . the cast is strong . tom skerritt and james woods take what could have been one-dimensional characters and develop them into something more . we don't exactly sympathize with them , but we understand their viewpoints . but the star of the film is jodie foster , who brings all of her considerable ability to the part of ellie , and infuses the character with passion , intelligence , and courage . foster deserves another oscar nomination for her work here . instead , in different ways , this movie recalls some of the best science fiction films . in fact , contact can stand on the same level as these and many other classics , and that is one definition of a great movie . if contact falls short in any area , it's an inability to fully develop all of its many subplots , but , given the time limitations of the medium ( the running length is already 2 : 30 ) , that's understandable . this is one of 1997's finest motion pictures , and is a forceful reminder that hollywood is still capable of making magic . " as far as the filmmaking process is concerned , stars are essentially worthless - and absolutely essential . " -- william goldman 
1	that's the most likely question after seeing tar ? rin's x . the most frequent question of those who haven't seen it is about the title . the short answer is that the film has nothing to do with pornography and that it is rated r , not x . telling an apocalyptic story with stirring , visual panache , this japanese animated movie ( anime ) dazzles us with its depressing images and dramatic music . if blade runner were remade into an animated feature by the japanese , this is probably how it would look . from what i was able to piece together it seems to involve the dragons of the heavens , who come from the 7 stars that make up the big dipper , the dragons of the earth and the tokyo power grid . i am not making this up . periodically the narrator stops for a minute and introduces another batch of characters along with their history . imagine that you have never heard of christianity and that you are introduced to it by a single animated movie that covers all the books of the bible . this describes the experience of watching x , which rin directs with a mixmaster approach . the film's images are stunning , but , boy , are they ever violent . the end of the world isn't pretty . as i watched the movie , unable to figure much of it out , i began to wonder why various figures are drawn the way they are . most of them have dime-sized mouths , whereas most of the men have full-sized ones . is this the way that the women keep so fashionably skinny ? in a movie that is deadly serious , the stilted dialog provides unexpected sources of mirth . ( " you're handling the situation so stylishly , i thought it would be unaesthetic to interfere . " ) although one could write this off to bad translations , i'm not buying it . princess mononoke had no such problem , and the ridiculousness of the script for x permeates every scene . if you want to enjoy more than just x's stunning look , perhaps reading the book would help . i can't say . what i do know is that even with my usual copious notes taken during the film , i still couldn't figure it out . the saving grace is that x never made me care that i found it indecipherable . x is dubbed in english and is rated r for violence , gore and some nudity . it would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
1	with its abundance of foreshadowing , flashbacks , and other methods of toying with time and reality , anna campion's feature debut , loaded , enjoys bending the audience's perceptions . add an atmosphere soaked in dark , ominous overtones , and the result is moody and artistic . unfortunately , campion ( who is the sister of the piano's jane ) doesn't invest the same effort into creating characters and smoothing out the narrative as she does shaping the tone . loaded introduces us to seven college-age characters who travel to an out-of-the-way country house to videotape a no-budget horror flick . no one else shares his enthusiasm , but they all participate , either by going in front of the camera or staying behind it . the title has multiple meanings . this loading can lead to anger that has no effective outlet . as strong as the core ideas are , however , campion's presentation is erratic . her script is poorly-paced . there's a protracted introduction that goes nowhere , and features a number of superficial conversations that purport to address " deep " issues . by the time things start happening , the movie is half over . this storytelling method might have worked if it had yielded a field of rich personalities , but these characters are incomplete -- a few unique , individual traits grafted onto the familiar post-generation x angst . the drug sequence is suitably hallucinogenic , although , as in roger avary's killing zoe , it goes on for too long . we see the wood grain of a table turn fluid and birds fly out of the wallpaper . campion effectively uses point-of-view shots during these sequences , but there's a time when becomes tedious . there's a certain artsy pretentiousness about loaded that the thick atmosphere and cleverly-constructed final act can't completely obscure . all the magical , mystical conversations about spirituality and life don't amount to much -- they come across as forced , and only serve to diminish the characters involved . there are times , mostly during the second half , when loaded develops into an eerily-compelling piece of film making , but these instances are offset by the many unsuccessful elements . overall , loaded is a promising debut , but too uneven to be considered much more than a curiosity . 
1	every time i saw the previews for in the name of the father , i wanted to see the show even more since it had some of my favorite movie components : a true story , courtroom drama , detective work , and some of the best acting talent around . sad to say that i only kind of liked this show . this 88% itself was slow and tedious . the acting was good especially by daniel day-lewis although he was not near as good as in the age of innocence . the writer was much more interested in the minutia of prison life than in courtroom scenes or detective work . i don't think so . the scriptwriters and the editor should have given us a lot more courtroom drama and detective work and less retreats about prison life . this is an overly earnest movie about an important subject . it is easy to review the subject rather than the movie . nevertheless , for me , the film only had a few good parts , but these were so outstanding that i give it thumbs up , and rated it * * 1/2 . it is rated r for serious violence . only mature teenagers should see it . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : january 16 , 1994 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	from audacious director paul verhoeven ( starship troopers , basic instinct and showgirls ) , hollow man is erotic , fascinating , imaginative , gory and , yes , a bit scary . the sexually charged script by andrew w . marlowe ( air force one ) uses this romantic triangle as a key subplot . the movie's special effects are amazing . graphic and gory , they show animals and a human going in and out of visibility . try as you may , you will not be able to look away , just like you have to see car accidents even if you know you should cast your eyes away . the script is as humorous as it is inventive . sebastian , for example , tells a great ribald joke involving superman and wonder woman . the movie plays up to men's secret voyeuristic desires -- want to see that gorgeous woman next door ? just slip in unannounced and unseen . -- so men may find the film more exciting than troubling . bacon is creepy and cocky . he plays the type of character you love to hate . " you make it by seizing the moment . " she is clearly an actress who should be cast more often . the film's opening sequence of an innocent mouse being eaten alive by an invisible predator serves notice of what is coming up . if you were expecting some innocuous and cute invisible man movie , you are warned that this isn't it and that you should quickly head for the exit . for those who stay the movie is great fun . the film even thumbs its nose at the mpaa rating board . knowing that the mpaa will allow frontal nudity in an r film so long as it's not male nudity , the director shows bacon's penis flapping as he walks . but it is done with a thermal image so that it can be argued that it wasn't really shown at all . " what would you do if you knew you couldn't be seen ? " an intriguing question which hollow man explores in some obvious but thought-provoking ways . " don't even think about it , " he says about something that he knows he shouldn't do . only in the end , when the film dissolves into a cross between aliens and a typical slasher flick , does it ever let us down some . but in the film's defense , it never takes itself too seriously , so that even the concluding segment is enjoyable . the real difference is that the ending doesn't have quite the freshness of the rest of the picture . it is rated r for strong violence , gore , language , nudity and sexuality and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
1	oliver stone , one of our most visceral directors , rarely makes anything but engaging films . he received oscars for his hard-hitting platoon and born on the fourth of july , but even his films like jfk , which are nothing less than balderdash , are fascinating and involving pieces of filmmaking . like him or hate him or both , his pictures are always in your face . u-turn can be argued to be one of stone's most shocking films since it is shockingly mediocre . people are likely to leave the theater neither engaged nor enraged . every frame is oversaturated with grainy colors , and the images frequently jump as if filmed with a strobe light . his obsession with panning and zooming will have you ready to cry uncle before the end of the first reel . the script by john ridley , which is based on his book " stray dogs , " relies on a stream of quirky characters to create his version of a black comedy . with stone as the director , half of hollywood shows up to take part . now , that's a part i could do . the star of the film , and the only one worth seeing is sean penn . in recent times penn's talent has become increasing evident . here , as in this year's she's so lovely , he steals the show . billy bob thornton plays darrell with a face caked in grease like a cartoon character who just walked into an explosion and with teeth that looks like he's been eating dirt . darrell flashes bobby a smile that says " i am about to take you for everything you have since i'm your only hope of getting out of this hellhole . " why aren't you one of them ? " is voight really this far gone ? why does this once excellent actor only takes roles that are caricatures ? penn saves the film , but just barely . a week after you have seen the show , only the film's bold , but repetitiously tiring cinematographic techniques will remain in your memory . nothing else about the film is unusual enough to be remembered , and that is the tragedy . has stone gone soft ? it is rated r for gore , sex , brief nudity , and profanity . the film would be fine for older teenagers . for penn's performance i give the film a mild recommendation and * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : october 1 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	writer and director gary ross , the writer and creator of big and dave , delights audiences once again with his best fantasy ever in pleasantville . like most teens , they blow all of this off , worrying more about their own popularity at school than the issues of the day . reese witherspoon delivers a dead-on performance as a sarcastic teen , who is aghast to be thrown into the plastic 1950s . the whole first half of the movie , as the kids cope and alter their new environment , is comedy at its best . intelligently written , the film's first part produces such a stream of laughter that you may need a second viewing to catch all the spoken humor and sight gags . breakfast , which is in danger of touching the ceiling , consists of stacks of dozens of pancakes , waffles , and toast . everything , absolutely everything , has always gone perfectly in pleasantville . like most television facades , there are a few things missing , like toilets in the bathroom stalls and words in the books , but the townsfolk don't mind . the movie explores change through the power of reading as well as sex . it is too bad that pleasantville had to come out the same year as the truman show since they will inevitably be compared . next to an almost perfect film like the truman show , pleasantville isn't as quite as good , having many fewer memorable lines for one and lacking the talent of a jim carrey for another , but this should not be allowed to detract from the incredible brilliance of pleasantville . as dazzlingly filmed by john lindley in a gorgeous black and white , the movie slowly develops color in small places like roses and tongues , until it bursts into a bouquet of saturated colors by the end . how and why things turn color is one of the mysteries that the story slowly reveals . at first the reason seems simple and almost trite , and then the complete rationale behind the colorization becomes the story's key turning point . visually it is a stunning technical achievement . once color appears in this innovative film , women's make-up is shown to be able to take on an entirely different role . starting as a hilarious comedy , the story transforms carefully into a serious satire on life's insanities . although it starts off as a romp , the film ends up with more messages than you can count , all of them delivered delicately but powerfully . part science fiction , the story asks the age-old question of what would happen to the future if you could alter the past ? moreover , would the results be what you expect and want ? david worries about this a lot , but jennifer is more interested in freeing the people from their chains and the consequences be damned . the movie contains many great small performances . the story has many surprises . you yell " cat ! " leaves them staring at you . put a bed on display that is twice the width of the standard issue single bed . unheard of . it is rated pg-13 for sexuality , mature themes and some profanity and would be fine for kids 12 and up . 
0	an uneven production marred by some ethnic slurs against a black butler ( muse ) and by holes in the mystery story , yet had its moments of sheer joy and ends up being a below average entry but can still be enjoyed as your typical charlie chan formula mystery story . this part of the investigation was slapstick comedy and ridiculous . there were also a healthy dosage of slurs against the hindus ; such as , the cops saying : " they all look alike to me . " " how many more ali baba's are there ? " the film was not tightly scripted as the story just didn't make sense , making it not logical to follow who the chief suspects were and what they were up to . also , we never learn why the planes are being sabotaged . too many tacked on explanations still can't clear up all the discrepancies , but that shouldn't really matter to the die-hard fans of the series . 
1	the film highlights the interactions of the likable but weakminded lukas and the vibrant emmy ( sophie rois ) to tell its sad tale . it is a dark morality tale , excitingly shot , about the powerful ones acting petty and cruel , while the peasants act with dignity and courage . ruzowitzky's film throws out many political ideas , gives one a true sense of what collective hatred and what class warfare are like . the film has many different moods to it : ranging from dark comedy to free-spirited romance to bitter violence . it is a well-made film ; it clearly shows how injustice is part of a system that enslaves people . 
1	babyfever is a henry jaglom movie , and his movies are an acquired taste . it was one of my favorite movies of the 80s . jaglom's style is that of a homemade documentary where the actors and actresses are told to act like they are not acting . he did not appear in the movie which surprised me since he is usually in his pictures . almost all of the movie happens during a 2 hour baby shower . to add a bit of comic relief , there is a side plot about the " rich " husband whose house is being used for the shower . the movie within the movie is great . the women are very funny and insightful with many great lines . i've tried that - it does no good . that is not what i want , i want a baby . " these one-on-one interviews are fascinating , and i can easily recommend this part of the show . most of the movie however consists of the awkward acting and dialog of the shower itself . this part is trite and tedious . the wheeler dealer subplot is kind of a nice diversion but nothing special . all of the techniques , operations , and drugs they discuss may sound foreign to some , but sounded familiar to me . it is a close call , but i can not recommend the movie because the main part was too banal and poorly acted . overall , i rate it * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	screenplay : lee david zlotoff . director : lee david zlotoff . maybe they smelled a female-appeal hit like fried green tomatoes ; maybe they liked the idea of countering the hollywood filth-monger mentality by supporting a film produced by clergy ; maybe , just maybe , they were genuinely touched by the story . whatever the reason , they have themselves a film which doesn't just jerk tears -- it slaps , kicks , pinches and pleads for them . the spitfire grill may be positive and uplifting , but it is so aggressive in the pursuit of your sympathy that it becomes exhausting . on its most basic level , the spitfire grill is yet another in a long line of films about benevolent strangers who teach intransigent folks a lesson in tolerance , and again the lead character is perhaps the most troubled , but not really the character who grows and changes . she is the sympathetic core of the film , and we grow to care about whether she will be able to find redemption . unfortunately , we never get to see her experience that redemption , and it is something of a cheat . it is never nearly as important to us that hannah makes peace with her demons , or that nahum learns to be accepting , or that any particular person ends up with the grill , but those are the only scraps we are tossed to give the spitfire grill any sense of consequence . in place of consequence , writer/director lee david zlotoff provides a film which often feels like a string of feel-good cliches , scored by james horner , the master of feel-good cliche music . zlotoff never misses the opportunity to send out scenes like tear-seeking missiles , scenes which might have been effective individually but en masse serve only to batter you insensible . if my description seems cruelly cynical , it is only because the spitfire grill numbs you with its pathos . in its own way , it is just as shallow as an action film which is just one explosion after another . the story goes that the spitfire grill was " commissioned " by a collective of catholic priests who wanted to back a film with " positive human values , " and i suppose you could say that they got what they ordered . everyone in gilead eventually does the right thing , and it is the kind of film which will probably end up on bob dole's hit parade . but in the course of injecting those human values , lee david zlotoff didn't bother to inject many human beings -- gilead , maine and nearly everyone in it ( particularly the terminally irrascible hannah ) seems plucked from a pepperidge farm commercial . alison elliott's performance is strong enough that , for a while , you might think the spitfire grill is about something , but it isn't about people whose troubles make you emotional . it's more of an endurance contest between you and your supply of facial tissues . 
0	this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled blue-collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times . it is hard to tell what is independent about this film ; it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam . it is the debut film for the director , who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults , a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s , where the mind-set of all the characters depicted is grounded , but to see it in the 1990s is a different story : it is old news . the introduction of the wise-guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit , are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tour-de-force performance by the star of the film , adrien brody as ray . the title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman-10b , which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film . you should be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that don't make sense : its constant brainless chatter between the buddies , their uneventful growing pains , and the despair of their lives , make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them . there is nothing i have seen so far to like about ray . he is undependable , mean-spirited , and stupid . as for ray's gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off , the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen . there was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting , though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star . because of his intensity and looks , he reminds me of sean penn . 
1	rush hour , regardless of what you may have read , is not a jackie chan movie . whereas it is true that jackie chan , one of the more engagingly delightful actors around , does appear in the movie , it is not the typical chan project to showcase his comedic brand of martial arts skills . director brett ratner , director of the widely-panned money talks , lacks much sense of action or comedic timing . rush hour drifts aimlessly for large portions , especially when chan isn't in the frame . the script by joel cohen and alec sokolow has some good laughs , but it isn't written nearly smart enough and frequently feels the need to sink to bad racial humor . people who haven't seen the talented chan in action may not be as disappointed as those who have become his fans . non-fans will undoubtedly enjoy the few times chan is allowed to cut loose , but those who have seen him at his best will likely be frustrated . chan's charms come as much from his sweet cherubic demeanor as his athletic skills and daring stunts . rush hour features chan as an untypically dour character whose seriousness gets in the way of his allure as an action hero with childlike innocence . philip baker hall and many other fine character actors are given nothing to do in the picture but collect a paycheck . viewers' degree of tolerance for tucker's brand of over-the-top , slapstick humor will be a major determinate of how much they like rush hour . at times he is extremely funny . most of the film plods along with the audience hoping that jackie will finally get some more screen time and be allowed to show off his skills . the only completely successful part of the film is the series of outtakes shown during the closing credits . but any film where the outtakes are dramatically better than the " intakes " is clearly in trouble . if the director had thrown out the script , left the set , and just filmed the characters ad-libbing , he would have had a superior product . it is rated pg-13 for violence and profanity and would be fine for kids around ten and up . 
2	it has been over a year now since i last gave a movie a full four stars , but i saw one this weekend that got my * * * * rating . i can only describe the age of innocence as devastating . martin scorsese described it as his " most violent film " . this is from a director who brought you taxi driver and raging bull . the violence in the film is strictly mental . there is no physical violence or even threats of any . the " violence " is strictly mental because the film , set in the late 1800s , is about repression and entrapment in an age of carefully prescribed moral actions . the sex in the film is mainly some great handholding although there are a few kisses . the cinematography by michael ballhaus is spectacular and deserves an oscar . the casting was excellent ( daniel day-lewis as newland archer , michelle pfeiffer as ellen olenska , and winona ryder as may welland ) , and the acting and directing near perfect . numerous oscar possibilities in this film . you could feel the repression of a society where you must act in a certain way and where most rules were extremely strict and yet most were implicit and unspoken . depending on your sex it would be hard not to identify with one of the key actor or actresses . you feel repressed when you left the theater . when the movie was over , i could hardly move . it was the same feeling i got when i first saw aliens . i just set there staring at a blank screen . the movie left such a strong impression on me that words seem inadequate to describe it . i thought the editing ( thelma schoonmaker ) perfect and would not want to see a single frame removed . the movie is rated pg although what it did to keep it from being rated g is not clear . anyone older than 8 could see it , but you probably need to be at least 15 to begin to truly understand it . this is a gem of a movie ; a near perfect movie . i award it * * * * and recommend this movie strongly . don't miss it ! * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	after seeing an ad of an airplane in a thunderstorm , readers might accidentally believe that the name of the movie turbulence refers to some atmospheric condition . the title refers to the state of mind of writers jonathan brett , steven e . de souza , and john herzfeld when they composed the script . i would like to issue a challenge to viewers of this film by director robert butler . why don't you take along an abacus and try to count the number of actions that either make no sense or are just outright ludicrous ? so that not too many more of you waste your money on this monstrosity , i will tell you several of them , but rest assured that i have just scratched the surface . if you are worried about my giving away part of the plot , i will probably not tell you much more than the trailers , but i will use many examples to illustrate my points . the script is so bad that i was laughing very loudly at all the wrong places . here is a question for you . you are sitting in a plane seat . trick question . you stay of course . i have lots more questions for you . let's say you are a federal marshal and your prisoner goes to the bathroom . do you think it is necessary to keep a close eye on him ? here are two of my favorites questions . and if you are the last person left flying the plane and the plane is on the verge of free-fall , do you think you'd take off your seat belt to roam around the plane to check on the rest of flight crew ? as you may guess , this misguided trust will soon pass and the real hero of the tale will emerge , flight attendant teri . this shamelessly manipulative story titillates the audience with a never-to-be sex scene as a prelude to more violence . " yes , but what if this sophisticated plane , " asks teri , " flies into an unsophisticated storm ? " and surprise , the scene is lifted straight out of a schlock horror film . halfway through this abysmal picture , i began to think of the roman emperors . i wanted so bad to stand up , turn my thumbs down , and yell , " kill 'em all . " what five albums would you pick ? " it is rated r for gory violence , implied rape , and profanity . the show would probably be okay for older teenagers who like horror flicks . i hated this movie and recommend everyone avoid it . i give it 1/2 of a star for the special effects . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : january 10 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	screenplay : pat proft . producers : pat proft , james g . robinson and bernd eichinger . director : pat proft . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( sexual innuendo , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 85 minutes . " leslie nielsen _is_ leslie nielsen " reads a tongue-in-cheek opening credit that opens wrongfully accused , and no irony could be more bitter . once upon a time nielsen was a b-movie dramatic actor who re-invented himself as a deadpan comedian thanks to the zucker-abrahams-zucker team , who cast him in airplane ! magoo . the one-time serious actor who used to play straight man so successfully against absurdist parody turned into a self-parody , mugging ever more shamelessly as he became typecast as the prat-falling dope . you can expect more of the same -- leslie nielsen once again _as_ leslie nielsen -- in wrongfully accused , the latest in a seemingly endless string of films this summer from zaz alumni . this one , written and directed by hot shots ! i don't know whether the strained comedy of wrongfully accused would have seemed any fresher if it hadn't come hard on the heels of mafia ! and baseketball , but it certainly doesn't help . proft tries to keep the gags coming fast enough to obscure the tedium -- perhaps believing he can convince an audience that a hundred lame jokes add up to one decent one -- but the gags are worse than uninspired . they're uninspired and redundant , the kind of stuff that makes you suspect proft and jim abrahams were sitting in a room together as they were hashing out this film and mafia ! , how else to explain the fact that both films include a shot of a man leaving a lipstick print from a kiss , and a computer generated tongue emerging from someone's ear , and shots at michael flatley ? those re-cycled gags are enough to make wrongfully accused feel ridiculously tired . nielsen's performance merely compounds the misery . he has become such a flashing red light for self-defeating satire that he simply can't play the role he once played : the slack-faced observer of anarchy . directors have decided it's easier to get the audience to laugh at nielsen than it is to write anything funny to which he can react . . . or , more appropriately , _not_ react . wrongfully accused features nielsen at his least appealing , throwing out rolled eyes , grimaces and misguided reaction takes by the truckload . instead of providing an incongruous presence that contributes to the humor , he becomes a vaguely pathetic aging class clown . i realize that subtlety has never been the forte of genre parody , but there are scattered moments when wrongfully accused appears to have a decent idea that's not head-smackingly obvious . the best laugh , one i'm sure was unintentional , comes from the 30-second cameo by sandra bernhard which belies her prominent featuring in the credits . it seems like a clever jab at julianne moore's cutting-room-floor performance in the fugitive , especially when nielsen refers to getting information from bernhard's character in a scene we never see . it's probably too much to expect that level of insider satire to be sustained , especially when it's so much easier to have nielsen bang his head on a low bridge while standing on the bow of the titanic . that's about the level of humor you can expect when a film's number one comedic weapon is leslie nielsen _as_ leslie nielsen . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
1	this theme has been done better many times before and in a superior way in such films as " shane ( 53 ) " and in clint's own " high plains drifter ( 72 ) . " this film adds little to the genre , except it is a visually stunning film as photographed by bruce surtees and clint's heroics are enjoyable to watch , as he unabashedly brings back many of the western's classic confrontational scenes , such as the showdown on main street and of the helpless man made to dance as the gunslingers fire away at his feet . otherwise , this is a somewhat disappointing venture , not because it isn't well-acted or directed , but because it is so stale that it becomes uninvolving . they are a rough looking bunch of desperadoes , all wearing long dusters , giving the final shootout , a very recognizable western touch . it's a fine film for those who don't mind that hero-worshipping is a good chunk of the plot , and that what was metaphorically hinted at never develops because of the film's awkward presentation . 
2	this debut indie film for director steven soderbergh is a stimulating but perverse psychological drama . the film is invasive sexually , but not in an explicit way , as there is no nudity and the film eschews sensationalism for an honest verbal character study . it is more interested in telling about the gulf between what is felt and what is perceived , as the main characters try to articulate what is at the root of their problems . at the cannes film festival , this low budget film , made for about $1 . 2 million , deservedly won la palme d'or for best film and the best actor award for james spader . this is much more than a voyeuristic film , as everything becomes personal . the script is intelligent ; the acting is superb ; and , the director has elicited spontaneous and natural performances , weaving it into a film where having a conversation about masturbation is as natural as talking about the weather . this is a film where sex is always kept as an intriguing mystery and a part of the story that adds spice to the wry humor of the events . and the trophy wife , can only respond , " i like the stability and john's promotion . " all the sexual ambiguity they both have for each other changes into a real liking they have for each other and an acceptance of how they are damaged goods but have the possibilty of changing for the better . the clever story becomes very emotionally satisfying , even if it ties things up a little too neatly . 
0	director : mel smith . a couple of years ago , director barry levinson made a movie based on a twenty-year-old idea . this pet project was loud , heavy-handed and self-indulgent , and clearly showed why it hadn't been made twenty years earlier : it wasn't a very good idea . however , levinson had acquired the cachet to make any movie he wanted to make , so he made toys . george lucas has even more cachet , and he also decided to produce a twenty-year-old idea . radioland murders is an attempt at farce that is simply chaotic and grating , and its frantic pace can't disguise the fact that it just isn't funny . however , there is a lot more going on backstage than onstage . for nearly its entire first hour , radioland murders succeeded primarily in giving me a terrible headache . the story rockets from character to character , lingering just long enough to let us see that each one is defined almost exclusively by a single annoying character trait . subtle nuance in characterization may be too much to expect from a broad comedy like radioland murders , but it's still a problem when virtually the entire cast is so irritatingly one-note that you begin hoping various characters will be the next to die . they are also stuck with dialogue that must have had whiskers on it in 1939 , like the ever-uproarious " you may think you know what i know , but i don't think you know what you think you know " bit . the slapstick is better , but it too is simply too stale to sustain the energy . every time he does so , radioland murders just stops dead , and it's not worth the jerky ride simply to see cameos by billy barty , rosemary clooney and george burns . ultimately , that decision is indicative of what is most wrong with radioland murders : no one seems clear exactly what it is supposed to be . a backstage farce a la noises off ? a romantic comedy ? lucas and his team of screenwriters seem to want it all , and as a result they end up without much of anything . radioland murders is one of those unfortunate films which equates loud and fast with entertaining , when in reality it's simply noisy and busy . 
1	cast : til schweiger , joachim krol , katja riemann , rufus beck , antonia lang director : sonke wortmann producer : bernd eichinger screenplay : sonke wortmann cinematography : gernot roll music : torsten breuer u . s . distributor : orion pictures classics although sonke wortmann's 1994 german film has a few things going for it , it's hard to understand why it was such a big hit in its native country . in addition to possessing a plot that approaches sexual issues ( both homosexual and heterosexual ) with refreshing candor and unselfconsciousness , maybe . . . maybe unfortunately , these assets can't bandage the film's fundamental flaw . as a comedy , it's only sporadically funny , and , as a drama , it lacks emotional depth . maybe . . . maybe not is clumsily constructed . it meanders , and doesn't seem to have a clear goal , except to say that it's possible for a gay man and a straight man to be friends without sleeping together . that's not an especially compelling statement , and this isn't an overly- interesting forum in which to present it . the conclusion is open-ended , and , while that might be okay for a more serious film , it's a drawback for something attempting to be a light comedy . norbert , a shy , nerdy sort of guy , is not-so-secretly attracted to axel , but the hunky hetero either doesn't notice , or pretends not to ( the film never makes it clear which is the case ) . ultimately , maybe . . . maybe i think we're supposed to identify with the axel , although it's difficult to say for sure , because he's such a self-centered jerk . it's far easier to relate to the doro , the neglected girlfriend , or norbert , the lonely gay man , but neither comes close to matching axel for screen time . maybe . . . maybe not is his film , but he's the least likable person in it . it's tough to enjoy a movie like this -- especially one that's supposed to be a comedy -- when you have to work not to hate the main character . most of the genuinely funny moments arise out of familiar comic setups : the stranger hiding in the closet , a case of mistaken identity , and someone arriving home earlier than expected . although there are laughs to be had from each of these situations , it's easy ( bordering on cheap ) humor . more interesting are wortmann's sly observations of how the homosexual culture stereotypes the heterosexual one . too often , however , the jokes fall flat . it doesn't take much insight to identify the numerous failed attempts at humor . the acting is good , even if character development is weak . maybe . . . maybe not certainly has good intentions , but , as every movie-goer knows , that's only a starting point . this film does little to build on its foundation . when it comes to seeing this movie , " maybe not " seems the best advice . 
1	one of the most important elements of any romantic comedy is that mysterious , unquantifiable quality referred to as " chemistry . " some couples have it ; others don't--that's a simple fact of films . how well the leads work together often determines whether a movie is successful or not . in the case of only you , norman jewison's latest production , actors marisa tomei and robert downey , jr . don't fully connect . there are times when the embers start to smolder , but a fire never ignites . as is the case with almost every motion picture in the genre , originality is not only you's strong suit . everyone going to the movie knows what's going to happen in the end--the only question is whether the path leading there will be more enjoyable than insipid . in this case , it is , but there's a lot missing as well . only you is entertaining without being exceptionally accomplished . the storyline has the advantage of including several minor twists designed to play upon the audience's expectations , and the rewrites of diane drake's script offer an alternative explanation for those who resolutely refuse to acknowledge the existence of destiny . amidst all the requisite formulaic situations , there are moments of surprising cleverness . unfortunately , tomei and downey appear less made for each other than their characters supposedly are . when harry met sally , the cutting edge , and even this summer's it could happen to you ( to name a few ) all worked to some degree because it's easy to accept that the lead characters fall in love . in only you , that impossible-to-define connection is weak . one of the problems may be that downey isn't in the first forty-five minutes of the film and when he finally appears , things seem to be rushed . or it could be that marisa tomei's faith is so focused on destiny that she never has an opportunity to develop a personality . tomei's energetic performance merely makes her hyperactively flat . the effect is obviously intentional , as shown by the inclusion of a scene at the " mouth of truth " that echoes roman holiday ( downey does a great vocal imitation of gregory peck ) . some will doubtlessly compare only you to jewison's most popular romantic comedy , moonstruck . similarities , however , are mostly superficial . moonstruck forged living , breathing characters from a keen script . only you doesn't do nearly as much , nor is its source material as impressive . despite some underlying ideas about forging one's own destiny , this is a essentially a light , inoffensive movie that will appeal to those who aren't seeking more than a bubbly romance . 
2	still gordon has a problem with which many will be able to identify . his poetry shows up in his advertising copy , but that is not enough for gordon . " poetry , advertising -- it's all the same words only in different order , " he argues . the enthralling movie has broad appeal from dilbert fans to romantics . the movie argues convincingly that we should all follow our hearts and our passions when it comes to work and to love . as the tenacious gordon comstock , richard e . grant shows the frustrations and the joys of one embarking on a tricky journey , trying to make money at something one really cares about . the bitingly funny script tells it like it is , while always displaying a big heart . " professionally speaking , you've entered a totally blind alley . " even if such jobs are common place , it isn't often that the boss tells you this during the hiring interview . lovingly directed by robert bierman , the film contains wonderfully evocative music by mike batt . inviting and magically happy , the music with its warm nostalgic feeling matches perfectly the handsome , 1930s sets and the golden cinematography . the little story meanders delightfully like a small brook cutting through lush fields . romantic , poignant , and exhilarating , the movie always rings true . with little laughs around every turn the film is as easy to watch as it is subtly substantial . it is full of messages without ever seeming to have many . " you can't beat that for value . " and this charming little movie gives full value from its beginning to its happy ending . " remember , " rosemary reminds gordon . follow your dreams , argues the movie , and you will be free . it is not rated but probably would be pg-13 for sexual situations . the film would be fine for kids around twelve and up . 
0	it doesn't have to be peeping through a bedroom window or watching a couple making love through a telescope . the seductive power of voyeurism is the knowledge that you're watching something real--not acted or scripted--and the players in the drama have no idea they're under scrutiny . it's addictive , and those hooked on it can become more involved in living the lives of others than their own . while the book is not a psychological or artistic milestone , it makes for compulsive page-turning . the story is entertaining and focused ( until the end ) , and the characters seem real . in the decisions made to turn the novel into a movie , all of that was lost . in the movie , voyeurism is a plot device in a script that goes nowhere and whose effete and implausible resolution leaves 50% of the audience's questions unanswered . if we really cared about the movie or its poorly developed characters , this might be a blow , but sliver is so badly put together that its abrupt conclusion is likely to provoke little response . personally , i don't have a problem with a movie changing the story of the book from which it has been adapted , as long as the changes are sensible and effective . the strengths of the original story are muted and the weaknesses magnified . the ending is nowhere to be found , and what appears in the movie is so disjointed and contradictory that it leaves the viewer feeling cold and cheated . because of writer eszterhas and actress stone , comparisons with basic instinct are unavoidable . actually , any similarities are superficial . there's a lot of nudity ( but no icepicks ) and a few deaths but , aside from eszterhas' often-embarrassing dialogue , the two films aren't that close . as if it isn't bad enough that the script needs a major re-write , this lackluster production suffers from other problems . sharon stone , who was effective as the femme fatale of basic instinct , shows a lack of aptitude in playing the woman-in-distress . her emotional range in sliver is limited and she fails to generate much sympathy . william baldwin's portrayal is too bland for a character with the depth of passion and emotion that zeke is supposed to have . tom berenger puts a great deal of energy into what is essentially a thankless role ( his character isn't in the book ) , but little that we see or learn about jack landsford makes much sense . the gem in the rough of sliver is polly walker ( the spoiled heiress of enchanted april , who phillip noyce also directed in patriot games ) , although she's on-screen for too few scenes . production-wise , sliver has the look and feel of something from mtv . the incidental music is intrusive and the quick-cuts are distracting . with the movie's focus on video , it's odd that the visuals are so pedestrian . there is also a sense of heavy editing . at least one scene referred to explicitly has been cut out . with thrillers , it's difficult to say who will like what . certainly , those who are looking for a good whodunnit won't find it in sliver . equally displeased with this film will be the moviegoer looking for a fast-paced film . even those who loved basic instinct may be disappointed--sliver has little of the tension and relentless energy that marked verhoeven's 1992 movie . all-in-all , there's little here to please anyone , and those who loved levin's book are bound to leave the theater disgusted . 
1	offbeat suspense story , with some romance thrown in , is a fast-moving crime caper , taking place mostly in a library . it's a spirited film , with enough cheap freudian explanations about the forger and his associate to keep you in stitches with its freudianisms . sanders's typical suave and maniacal performance , plus the b&w noir-like lighting for the film , give it a mysterious look , and the many twists in the plot and its unusual location , make it a better- than- usual b-movie . 
2	shown at the philadelphia festival of world cinema running length : 1 : 10 mpaa classification : not rated ( mature themes , profanity , violence ) alongside hoop dreams , this is one of the best documentaries i've seen chronicling the difficulties of coming of age in the inner city amidst pervasive violence , drug use , and prostitution . the results of these taped diaries are at times shocking , often moving , and always gripping . it's one thing for a professional film maker to come into a situation and document what's happening ; it's something entirely different for one of the participants to do so . teen dreams' greatest strength is its perspective . but frank's story is not without optimism . la traun's story is the most upbeat . it is a stirring triple portrait , and we come to understand frank , adawna , and la traun through their own words and thoughts . without the filter of a professional film maker , there is a starkness to this work which is often missing from other , similarly-themed documentaries . 
2	this story is very colorfully photographed and has very little dialogue . the final story is surreal and is very comical . marzieh meshkini is the wife of noted iranian film director mohsen makhmalbaf . he served as the film's screenwriter . even though they are different women depicted , it might as well be the same woman because the film is a metaphor for all iranian women . strangely enough , the iranian censors wanted the director to cut this part because they found it too erotic . we know exactly how she feels and how determined she is not to be bullied by them , as we clearly see her animated facial expressions . in any case , it is evident from this episode that a divorce can be attained quite easily by a man . this is an irresistible film . i ate it up as quickly as i used to lick an ice cream cone when i was a kid . you can learn more about iran from watching a movie like this one than you can by following the news stories reported by the media . 
2	having lived through and somehow survived the cultural revolutions of the late 60s and early 70s american style , not fully aware of what the french upheaval was all about , except to notice that there was more of an identification over there between the working-class and intellectuals , and not the same usage of hallucinogenic drugs and anti-vietnam protests that was sweeping the american landscape . his pick-up line to her is , " i don't have time to have a drink with you but can i have your telephone number . " this " take me seriously " three and a half-hour film is surprisingly never dull , and is always diverting and titillating in its sexual characterization of these three rather likable and vulnerable participants in experimental living , that has its ups and downs as far as their compulsive libertine tendencies go . with all the so-called sexual freedom they have , it is discernible that there seems to be a lot of tension around them , making one wonder really if they are enjoying themselves more than their bourgeoisie counterparts are . all the quirkiness and nonsensical palaver of childish 1970s rebellion is seen here , along with a strong sense of connecting with others of the similar mind-set , allowing sex to be the liberating experience that it should be for them , if what they are into is to be taken seriously as some kind of revoluntionary statement . this is not your typical hollywood romantic happy ending for a film , but one that is very fitting for this film . it is worth noting , that the director of this seminal work , jean eustache , killed himself at age 42 in 1981 , and that certainly some parts of this film were based on his real-life experiences . the acting is superb . the only thing that is impressive about his intellect , was that he is often seen carrying a book by proust under his arms as he goes to the cafe to read , which is bookmarked to the story about " the captive . " all the women are special in their roles , making us look at them bodily-wise as well as at their mind . i see very little differences between the 1973 sexual mores and the 1999 ones . the later year is when i saw this film on video for the first time . how this film plays out , depends on one's perspective about sex and relationships , and how important they are ; if , perhaps , they are the most important worldly concerns one has , even more important than money or career or philosophy , then this film should prove to not only be entertaining but mindful . if thought of , as otherwise , then the film could still prove to be a most revealing study of how women look at men , especially men who think they are real smoothies . it also should indicate that women often choose these smoothies over other men because they like to play games with men and feel comfortable being around such men . what the film accomplishes , is to not rely on its plot and on any particular message , but to allow things to happen as they normally would , relying on the compelling nature of the actors to garner our interest , and our natural curiousity about what makes us love one another until it reaches the surface of some common understanding . that this was successfully done , can be attested by me from my own experiences and how important sex was for me in forming a relationship during the 1970s , it also seemed to shape my attitudes in love and in the sense i had of the world . sex always seems to be revolutionary because it is never static , it is never quite done in the same way . this film shows no signs of its age , it is impressive enough for me to watch today as it was for me to live vicariously through it in my thoughts of the 1970s . i think that the filmmaker could do no wrong in this film , every gesture and endless chat seemed so terribly right . and if the film is not an optimistic one , then that is just the way the filmmaker saw the situation of the lovers .

" quentin tarantino , however , has managed the near-impossible : improve upon the extraordinary . pulp fiction shows what can happen when a talented and accomplished filmmaker reaches his apex . this film is one wild ride . writer/director tarantino has merged film noir with the gangster tale and pulled them both into the '90s . as definitive as francis ford coppola's godfather saga was for the '70s , so is pulp fiction for today's generation . some have wondered whether tarantino can create women of strength and independence equal to his men . pulp fiction supplies the answer with a resounding affirmation . both sexes are rendered with similar depth and insight . pulp fiction's three tales are structured to intersect and overlap at key points , even though they are not presented in chronological order . tarantino arranges his initial scene to dovetail with his final one in a remarkable example of closure . those confused by the structure will see everything clearly once the final line is spoken . sometimes , it appears , helping out marsellus is not without its complications . as was the case in reservoir dogs , tarantino's crisp dialogue sparkles . the vulgarity-laced monologues and conversations ripple with humor and are ripe with points to ponder . foot massages , hamburgers , comfortable silence , a gold watch , pot bellies , divine intervention , and filthy animals--all these and more receive the writer's attention as he presents meaningless issues in an intensely-fascinating and almost lyrical fashion . who else ( except perhaps david mamet ) can make profanity sound so poetic ? whether it's an effect of the script , the direction , or something else , these two turn in surprisingly strong performances . and they're not the only ones . all the details are executed to perfection . ironies abound in the smallest situations . and it takes a director of rare talent to find the humor in an ugly , bloody situation . mixing the original with the derivative , tarantino pushes pulp fiction in directions that are both anticipated and unexpected . relentless in its pace , pulp fiction is as exhausting as it is exhilarating . yet there is considerably more to this film than a speed with good actors . with this film , every layer that you peel away leads to something deeper and richer . it's a rare film that can say that , and a rarer one that can do it in the manner that this one has . 
2	feast of july is a movie based on an h . e . bates novel . for those of us who have read his books or seen any of the wonderful masterpiece theater adaptations on tv ( " love for lydia " , " country matters " , etc . ) , we know right away that something special is about occur when we see bates name . his stories are quiet ones with much depth and heavy characterizations . they tear at your heart . the movie feast of july ranks among the best of the bates movies and mini-series . first time movie director christopher menaul ( who did the great " prime suspect i " on tv ) does a brilliant job of moving bates to the big screen without removing any of the small aspects that makes bates's works so special . it would have been a temptation to try to jazz up the script with more dialog or to direct the actors to be more lively , but he showed great control and confidence in his material . he knew that he had a strong cast , and he could rely on the story and on facial expressions and body language to tell much of the tale . bates teaches us all about the human spirit , and menaul trusted his audience not to get bored , but to pay attention and get wrapped up in an entrancing story . she is having an extremely realistic miscarriage . with a single image the director and some great acting have already captured our heart . i rarely want to cry three minutes into a show as i did then . although it was a novel , it feels like a short story since it has such simplicity and yet great intensity . even the little parts of the story are special . the sets appear to be extremely accurate recreations of the period . quite compelling . the cinematography by peter sova is incredible . where do i begin with so many examples ? let me cite just two . in the fog scenes , the characters move through the fog like sad black ghosts as only their outline shows . in the scene of the lighting of the gas lamps on the street at night and of the dinners lit only by oil lamps , the pictures are realistically dark and yet possess a warm glow as if it is a metaphor of the attempt for inner peace of all of the characters . all of the actors and actresses delivery terrific performances . it is hard to single out any since it is an ensemble piece of acting . i guess embeth davidtz is my favorite , but all were so good . with only a few lines , gemma jones steals most of the scenes she is in . the dialog as written by bates and as carefully and lovingly adapted for the screen by christopher neame , is sparse and yet carefully constructed for maximum effect . each of the characters is special in some way . finally , the ending of the movie is excellent and left me gripping the chair as the credits started to roll . it is rated r for sex and violence . it would be excellent for teenagers of all ages to see it . i highly recommend this heart wrenching tragedy to you , and i give it * * * 1/2 . with a little stronger middle , it could have gotten my top rating . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : october 31 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	this scorsese " mean streets " type of film has been done too many times and often much better than it was done here , for it to have much of an impact . it was mildly entertaining , setting a wiseguy mood in a wealthy suburban area instead of using the usual locale of the gritty urban streets . but the film had such a pat look to it , i just couldn't help feel that it was phony , an annual staging of a movie about wannabe mafia youths that seems to be the dream-baby of almost every new indie director . it seemed to be striving to get some laughs , release some suburban angst , while trying to find the missing ingredient in its tale of innocence lost . . . which it never found . the 26-year-old first-time director rob weiss , has this low-budget film put all its cards on the action table , moving it along at a fast clip . the weakness of this plot , is that the friendship among the three never seemed to be anything but a superficial one , yet we are supposed to believe it is packed with a great deal of emotion at present . billy is just a bad egg , a weasel . it is difficult to find one thing about him that is likable . i also found it hard to believe that he became a big-time criminal , he just seemed to be too punky . the problem with this creepy friendship tale , one solely based on criminal schemes and drug deals , is ultimately the problem with this film -- because when the friendship breaks up , who cares ! and if we don't care , the film becomes empty , though it's good for a few laughs . 
1	the director is clearly more concerned with artful flourishes , elizabeth's lustfulness , and the modern ways to look upon a queen trying to be a ruler of men , rather than exploring further the tragic and specific drama of the times . this one's primarily a costume piece melodrama that enjoyably emphasizes the conspiracies surrounding the so-called virgin queen , who is destined to rule england's golden age for some 40 years . it was a scene that seemed out of place when compared to the rest of the film , even though it was a striking and memorable scene . elizabeth is a film with a propensity for depicting spacious castles that have dark interiors and characters who have dark intentions . elizabeth creates a panoramic view of 16th century england and its intrigues . it is a film that does a better job making elizabeth a vivid characterization , than it does of providing unforgettable dialogue and good storytelling . cate blanchett becomes elizabeth , giving her a modern feminist voice and a dark look inside her soul , in a daring performance that works out rather well , considering the film was emotionally flat and uninvolving .

1	the movie then moves to the past and brings us up to the present in a straight forward chronological sequence . this historical footnote is an effect way of reminding american viewers that the real california natives are mexicans and the immigrants are the actually the americans who took over california and redefined the social structure . here the family was reminiscent of the large italian families in the godfather albeit the sanchez family's many brushes with the law were not near as dramatic or as often . the acting by esai morales and elpidia carrillo was the best . morales gives a performance full of life . his performance was the most interesting to me although jimmy smits had the character with the most anger and potential . for a small role , elpidia carrillo won over my heart . the cinematography was of equal quality . every scene appeared to be filmed in the last ten minute glow of sunset . many scenes were actually filmed then , you can tell by observing the shadows . for a show so well constructed and which tries so hard to do for mexican americans what films like to live did for the chinese , i must admit i was extremely frustrated by it . like a rock skimming across a pond but never getting wet , we meet , but only briefly , numerous characters . we are told innumerable stories some of which they have little time to act out but feel compelled to tell us anyway . watching the movie it is as if your neighbor invites you over to tell you the story of his vacation , flashes 800 slides in front of you and then wishes you good-bye . you leave knowing very little about a lot of places , but not knowing anything in much depth . contrast this script with that of to live which also spanned 3 decades . in that movie , the scenes lasted much longer , and we got to know the characters much better . she should have cut out more scenes and gave the ones left more substance . another , albeit smaller problem , is with the believability . were this not being presented documentary style , one could ignore plausibility , but not as presented . surely she could have hitchhiked , earned money for bus fare or something . it is in english , but with the first ten minutes in spanish with english subtitles . it is rated r for knife fights , some blood , a little profanity , and brief nudity , but it is a mild r . this movie would be fine for teenagers to see on their own , but i do not think it is appropriate for younger children . i found the picture too frustrating to recommend it , but i do award it * * for great intentions and partial success . in the small theater where i saw it , everyone left early except me . i don't think they missed anything since after a while the surface skimming got repetitious . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : may 22 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	screenplay : chuck pfarrer and jonathan lemkin . director : antony hoffman . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , adult themes , brief nudity , profanity ) running time : 106 minutes . some genre films tease you with the prospect that they can be something more substantial before degenerating into stupidity and cliche . red planet at least does viewers the courtesy of not wasting their time with such futile hopes . and that scientist burchenal ( tom sizemore ) , he sure has an ego , which undoubtedly will create some sort of character tension down the road . dim-wittedness in hollywood action films is only to be expected at this point in cinema history . vaguely pretentious dim-wittedness is pretty inexcusable . you see , earth has become nearly uninhabitable due to environmental degradation , and our only hope of survival is creating a survivable atmosphere elsewhere , but something has gone screwy because oxygen readings have suddenly dropped . at certain points in red planet , you can't help but wonder why anyone wasted time on a back story at all . though the very survival of the human race is theoretically at stake , the film seems interested in that point only to the extent that it can be included in press notes , in absurd declarations like , " it's a smart movie that posits the question , what if man fails to do the things necessary to live on earth ? " in fact , red planet resolutely refuses to deal with anything beyond the basic goals of its characters to find a way back to earth . what exactly was the reason that no one could detect any oxygen , when it turns out there's a whole lot of it around ? and why flirt with the notion that there's some intelligence bent on thwarting the terraforming effort , only to make the real villain of the piece the crew's resident malfunctioning evil robot ? silly questions , of course , since red planet is kind enough to alert you so quickly to its minimalist intentions . the characters spout dialogue that alternates between inane exposition and pointless self-characterization . " we're sexually attracted to one another , so i hope neither one of us dies , " say bowman and gallagher , though not in so many words . " i sure wish it didn't take 40 minutes for you to answer , " says bowman after sending a radio message to earth , actually in so many words , just to let us know the writers knew at least one science fact . it's a wonderful irony in red planet that it places so much weight on the fate of these six characters , only to make them utterly weightless as actual characters . at odd intervals , something happens to slap the film out of its oxygen-deprived stupor . most of them involve moss , whose strong presence occasionally tricks you into thinking the film is better than it is . one involves a great shot of the mars lander taking a tumble for which it certainly wasn't designed . and , sadly , many others involve the pleasure of watching one or another of the annoying characters meet an untimely demise . as directed by rookie feature director antony hoffman , this is a lame special effects-driven action film that can't even be bothered to provide a handful of visceral thrills . lacking big-time action excitement , competent story-telling or any desire to prevent you from walking out scratching deep trenches into your head , red planet is simply a planet-sized waste of time . but at least it only wastes a few minutes of your time before making that obvious . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
0	stiles ( 10 things i hate about you ) just does not have the body of a ballerina . would you cast danny devito to try out for the nba ? don't get me wrong , the only good part of the movie is their relationship together . the problem is that they don't fit the script , and even if they did , this is not a movie worth making . between its lame dance sequences is more dead air time than a radio station during a long power blackout . the movie , directed by thomas carter and written by duane adler and cheryl edwards , never can decide what kind of movie it wants to be . sometimes it's a sappy melodrama . sometimes it tries to be a hard hitting drama about jealousy among the races over interracial dating . sometimes it is about male bonding ( " blood is thicker than blondes . " ) and sometimes , finally , we get around to dancing , but the choreography is so awkward and the editing so choppy that you probably won't care . at this point , sara refuses to dance anymore or even talk about it . along the way we are taught many dubious moral lessons . the kids all get fake ids and drink illegally in a fancy nightclub in elegant clothes . and then there's the issue of violence . yes , this whole script is lifted from lots of other films and plays , most notably west side story . but in those , the actions have some amount of credibility . here people are shot , but the dreamy background music makes it seem downright romantic and not especially painful . i like stiles and thomas together . i did not like the movie in which they found themselves stuck . it is rated pg-13 for violence , sexual content , language and brief drug references and would be acceptable for teenagers . my son jeffrey , age 11 , gave the picture just * * . he thought it was too slow , the whole malakai character was unnecessary , and he didn't like sara's relationship with her parents . 
1	just in case we miss the similarities , the movie has jagger say things like " make my day ! " and lest we miss the connection between elliot's brand of jewish humor and woody allen's , there is a dream sequence in which elliot sounds just like woody . about an undercover cop who investigates international crimes in the world of fashion models , this movie within the movie has the potential for some nice parody but get little screen time . most of the comedy is flat and obvious . like a jet without enough power to lift off the runway , the film just taxis around slowly . slack pacing is deadly for comedy , especially for one like this in which the good lines are few and far between . even the best lines aren't anything to write home about . " i think i need something more neutral on the walls , " joey says in the film's best interchange .

2	anne de salvo is a talented actress who usually plays supporting roles . if you see her , you will probably recognize her . women without implants is an extremely funny comedy about women's breasts . the film is much less risque than you might guess , and de salvo just signed a deal to get it shown on the lifetime cable network on march 9th . i suspect she will be able to show it without editing since , as funny as it is , it is never very explicit . as always , i will keep my reviews even less explicit and g rated . each has a theory as to which is the best brand and why . as in all of the show , every line is precious . de salvo's script has humor that hits the mark with enough truth in every line to make the laughs bite . this is no ugly film with a handheld camera and a low budget look . the print looks great with a hazy warmth . even the editing ( adam bernardi ) is crisp and dramatic . although it is a short film , there are several great scenes . i will not reveal her actions then nor what she does at the trip to the plastic surgeon , but rest assured that you are in for many laughs and several surprises . after the film was over , i got to ask the director some questions . i was surprised to find out that the script was not ad libbed at all . she wrote every word of the script before the project started . it has the naturalness of some actresses sitting down together and starting to cut up to see what material they could improvise . de salvo said the message she is trying to give in the film is , " what's right for you is right for you , and it's nobody else's business . " the film does exactly what she set out to do and delights and charms its audience in the process . women without implants runs just 20 minutes , but there is so much in it , i thought it was twice that long . it is not rated , but would probably be pg-13 for the frank conversations . the film would be fine for kids 10 and up . i enjoyed this funny , short film so i recommend it and give it * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : january 30 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	so what's on your ideal movie checklist ? let's take a look at director luis mandoki's message in a bottle and see how it stacks up . check . with kevin costner , robin wright penn and paul newman , you've got them in spades . gorgeous images ? thanks to caleb deschanel's dazzling cinematography of glistening ocean waters and warm interior sets , you can put a big checkmark there . believable romantic chemistry ? another check . costner and penn are wonderful together and just as awkward as lovers in real life would be . how does your personal ranking system handle intelligent stars stuck in a heavily clich ? d drama ? in this case the whole audience knows what several of the key turning points have to be , and they're right . and how many credits do you deduct when a completely ridiculous and implausible ending comes totally out of left field for the sole purpose of mass audience manipulation . do you feel violated as a viewer ? in a movie that is as inviting and charming as it is annoying and infuriating , how to evaluate it is a tough call . sometimes you're captivated , and other times you're exasperated . will the good outweigh the bad for you ? maybe one of those personality tests would help . if you are in the hopelessly romantic category , you'll probably like the film's soap opera predictability and emotional shenanigans . on the other hand , if you' re more analytic , well ? you get the idea . teresa is a beautifully shy sort who bursts into girlish giggles when she feels unsure of herself . until this clich ? d scene , they have a romance that's heavy on cuddling . for one , dodge claims that his son's coffee is so terrible he shouldn't foist it off on any potential girlfriends . after a long romance that is quite sweet but meanders frequently , the movie comes to its maudlin conclusion . the result is a mixed bag of a movie ? just right for some viewers but perhaps too clich ? d for others . message in a bottle runs too long at 2 : 12 . the movie is rated for pg-13 for sexuality and a little profanity and would be fine for kids 11 and up . 
0	it astonishes me that two films with essentially the same story can be of such different quality . henri-georges clouzot's 1955 murder mystery , diabolique , was a taut , atmosphere-saturated thriller filled with unexpected twists and turns . jeremiah chechik's ill-advised rip- off is a lame hollywood attempt to re-create a similarly suspenseful experience . i suppose it's possible to argue that , because clouzot's picture was made over forty years ago , a remake isn't unreasonable . the problem is , the original diabolique was as much a cinematic landmark as hitchcock's psycho ( clouzot and hitchcock had a tremendous influence on each other ) . one should not undertake remaking a great film lightly , if at all . unfortunately , in this case , " integrity " wasn't a concept the film makers were concerned with . modernizing diabolique also means adding some exploitative elements . isabelle adjani disrobes early in the film for no apparent reason other than to give viewers a chance to ogle her . there's also a steamy sex scene featuring nicole and guy that serves no purpose -- we already know that the two are lovers . as was the case with the american rendition of the vanishing , the film makers here have decided to change the ending . gone is the deliciously diabolical finale of clouzot's picture , replaced by something that's unambiguous , unambitious , and manifestly unoriginal . don roos' routine conclusion is the kind of massive cop-out likely to disappoint anyone hoping for something fresh . isabelle adjani gives a horrible performance , overacting almost every scene . there were instances when her expressions of speechless horror reminded me of fay wray's exaggerated reaction to king kong ( albeit without the screams ) . sharon stone and chazz palminteri are barely adequate as cartoon-like characters , displaying little range in one-dimensional roles . the only one who does anything with her part is kathy bates , but her energetic portrayal as a cynical detective is largely wasted . everything seems to be wrong with this version of diabolique . the acting is subpar , the direction is pedestrian , and the screenplay is moronic . certain lines are laughably bad ( " it's not like you burnt the toast , mia . the cinematographer has unsuccessfully attempted to recapture the original's eerie , black-and-white atmosphere by using everything from inappropriately-placed shadows to foggy rainstorms . little about this diabolique is worthwhile , and nothing is laudable . my advice is to ignore the remake and rent the original . 
1	directed by kitano without any of dirty harry's comedic flourishes and without the character depth of kitano's more successful fireworks , the movie does start promisingly . in his mind the world is easily dichotomized into the victims and the punks -- his favorite expression being " damned punk . " violent cop , which has almost no music and little ambient noise , possesses a serenity that is periodically punctured by random acts of increasingly horrific violence . kitano's acting is always intriguing , but the thin story has trouble holding the viewer's interest . starting off as a character study , the picture quickly degrades into just a collection of stylized acts of violence . the intensity of kitano's acting and directing has to be respected even if they become increasingly difficult to admire as the story grinds on . the english translation of the dialog sometimes becomes laughably sparse . coach me . " the minimal plot involves drugs , but the plot is just a ruse . the whole point of the picture is to let azuma demonstrate his sadomasochistic behaviors . and so is the movie -- violently crazy . the film is in japanese with english subtitles . it is not rated but would be an r for strong violence , drug use and sex . the film would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are older and mature . 
1	a screwball comedy set in harrisburg , pa . , in 1988 , where the ethics for the main characters become so twisted allowing everyone in the film to be perceived as either an incompetent jerk or an incompetent crook . nora ephron directs this farce with the aim to mine all the laughs taken from the foibles of the slow-witted characters and pull all the nuggets out of their characterizations that adam resnick scripted , as the film holds up rather well until the clumsily navigated tidied up ending , which made no ethical sense . the film's main assets are in the sterling cast , who all have a flair for making their roles brim with comedy . the key ingredient to this comedy , is john travolta , who was never better in a comic role , and the good chemistry between him and lisa kudrow , who as a sexpot with a heart of steel , is just fabulous in making her character both despicable and amusingly likable . we see in the opening moments , that he's a narcissistic jerk but one who's so corny and willing to please , that he's oddly acceptable as a human being . it was a brilliant comic set-up , which gave the film a delicious comic aroma . for this one mistake , he is made to suffer for it during the entire film . his slow-thinking process and keen sense of timing to draw out the comic situation , made his role a very funny one . this was a satisfying comedy ( the best way to judge a comedy is if you are laughing -- and , i was ) . it was effortlessly well-acted , with plenty of sight gags and changes of facial expression on the bewildered characters to make almost every scene a funny one . " lucky numbers " didn't hit the jackpot , as the story was too shallow to allow for that , but i got some good comedy action for the price of the movie ticket . 
2	cast : alan arkin , pedro cardoso , fernanda torres , luiz fernand guimares , claudia abreu , nelson dantas , matheus nachtergaele director : bruno barreto producers : lucy barreto screenplay : leopoldo serran based on the novel o que isso , companheiro by fernando gabeira cinematography : felix monti music : stewart copeland u . s . distributor : miramax films in portuguese and english with subtitles these are just two of the issues addressed by bruno barreto's behind-the- scenes look into the politics of revolution and terrorism , and how the best intentions often lead to ugly results . while there are many revolutionary groups , most are confused and fragmented . four days in september works to some degree as a thriller , but it's more effective as a drama . the film makes a number of telling points about the consequences of adopting violence as a legitimate means of revolution . those words , and the epilogue that follows , underscore barreto's point that revolution ( or terrorism , depending on your viewpoint ) is more likely to generate disillusionment than heroism . renee tends to his head wound and offers soothing words of comfort . it's no longer a matter of slogans , but of flesh-and-blood human beings . but the flawed nature of their plans makes this film all the more believable ( it is based on a true story ) . another aspect of the movie that enhances its credibility is the way barreto works to detail the interpersonal relationships among members of the movement , such as the animosity between fernando and jonas and the sexual tension between maria and fernando . the film's best performance is given by american actor alan arkin , who successfully essays a cultured man attempting to retain his dignity in a nearly-impossible situation . as fernando , pedro cardoso does a solid job of presenting the disintegration of a idealist . indeed , at times , the movie treads through familiar territory ? this isn't exactly a unique perspective ? but the intelligence and passion in barreto's approach lift the film to a higher level . this motion picture is not groundbreaking , but it is fascinating and thought-provoking , and offers a little suspense to enliven the drama . - ingmar bergman 
0	moviegoers should be experimental , but not downright foolish . i knew i was taking a significant risk by trying another movie with alec baldwin in it , but when i saw eric roberts name on heaven's prisoners' opening credits as well , pain hit , and i realized what trouble i was in . baldwin's last flick , the juror , was a major bomb and most of his other recent films have been equally unsuccessful . don't get me wrong , both actors possess great talent , but it is coupled with a death wish when it comes to finding scripts and with an excessive ego that leads to heavy overacting . eric roberts hasn't given a good performance since 1983 in his brilliant star 80 . i tried , i promise i tried to like this show . liking a script ( scott frank and harley peyton based on a book by james lee burke ) that is so bad , as i will shortly demonstrate , that you want to laugh at it rather than with it is not easy . these actors are not the sort you turn loose on their own . let me see if i can give you a feel for this turkey . he starts the movie by confessing , " i want a drink . i want a drink all the time . " sure . that would sure scare me if i didn't break out in uncontrollable laughter first . later he really frightens poor larry with , " if i were you , i'd find another zip code . " whew . see what i mean about this sizzling dialog ? it isn't only dave that gets to say these stupid things . well , that would certainly make the police lineup go faster . oh yes , all of the leads can never make up their minds about their accents which fade in and out like the tide . break your ear plugs if you come . there are lots of explosions and general loud sounds as people get shot at and beat up in about every other scene . the film is needlessly gory , but the biggest sadist is editor william steinkamp who lets the show go on for what seems forever . i was ready to walk out , but the show at been going on for almost an hour and a half , so i decided to stay in deference to my wife who was not visibly as bored as i was . i was shocked to find the film go on for almost another hour past that . one final good note , the atmosphere of the louisiana bayous is great . heaven's prisoners supposedly runs 2 : 10 , but i think it may have been longer . it is rated r for some nudity , some bad language , and lots of violence . it would be okay for most teenagers . be wary of any movie that is not screened in advance to the local critics as this one was not . based on the large size of my audience , this seems an effective strategy . do not come anywhere near this disaster . i give the film 1/2 of a star , but only for the atmosphere . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	starring : jasper salen , stellan skarsgaard , basia frydman , niclas olund . it may be my imagination , but the last two years seem to have been a particularly good time to be a young actor . whether it's representative of some societal yearning for a return to innocence , a rare influx of young talent , or some happy confluence of the two , coming-of-age dramas have become nearly as ubiquitous as hugh grant . none of which makes a good one any less desirable , and the slingshot is a good one indeed , a sharply written swedish import with a singular perspective and exceptional performances . but in spite of his many obstacles , roland navigates through his difficult world with determination and an inventive spirit . as with the other recent films i mentioned , the slingshot rests squarely on the small shoulders of its young star , and jasper salen is up to the task . with a round , open face reminiscent of a christmas story's peter billingsley , salen manages to convey both innocence and toughness in the delicate balancing act required by ake sandgren's adaptation . while many things happen * to * roland , he is never merely a receptacle . roland is always thinking , and it is this intelligence that comes through in salen's performance . although the slingshot is , as one might expect , primarily episodic , it is still rich enough thematically that it never feels like merely a loose collection of scenes . foremost among these themes is the clash of capitalism and socialism , personified by roland himself . when roland shows a cat his newly refurbished bike and says to it , " that's mine , " it is as succinct a statement of rebellion as one might imagine . the slingshot's key failing may be that it tries to do too much , and some of the scenes begin to seem repetitive . the obligatory moment of sexual awakening seems just that--obligatory--and ends with a scene surprisingly lacking in emotional punch . those relationships , particularly roland's complex interaction with his father , are what make the slingshot memorable . thanks to jasper salen's splendid work , the slingshot takes its place as a worthy addition to the list of fine coming-of-age films . 
1	screenplay : pamela gray . director : tony goldwyn . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , nudity , profanity , adult themes , drug use ) running time : 105 minutes . a walk on the moon is a coming-of-age film , which may lead you to expect the fetishizing of adolescent sexual experimentation ; it's set during 1969's summer of love -- and at woodstock , no less -- which may lead you to expect even more " wonder years " -esque navel-gazing than usual . there are some pleasant surprises in a walk on the moon , actor tony goldwyn's directing debut , but the most pleasant may be that it's mature . taking a unique perspective on that singularly revolutionizing american summer , it's a simple , occasionally corny story with enough wisdom to realize that comings-of-age don't happen exclusively to teenagers . this summer seems certain to be something different , however . pearl's story is a particularly interesting one to set during a time of social upheaval . though gray occasionally turns her subtext into overly melodramatic text ( alison : " you had your chance to be the kid ! " pearl : " no , i didn't ! " ) , a walk on the moon generally lets diane lane's solid performance bring out pearl's conflicts . goldwyn also does a nice job of creating his 1960s catskills milieu as a distinct , amusing time and place . the portrayals do occasionally drift into the stereotypical , notably tovah feldshuh as marty's predictably iron-willed , oy-spouting mother , but the characters still maintain a sense of individuality even within their own world . when the throng of counterculture kids descends on this world for the generation-defining concert -- including a quick skinny-dip in the camp's private lake -- it provides a well-realized picture of the new freedom that calls to pearl . the only reason a walk on the moon feels awkward is that it fumbles the sub-plot involving alison's own adventures . they take a half-hearted middle ground when one of the two extremes -- focusing entirely on pearl or making the two stories equally significant -- would have been genuinely effective . fortunately , when a walk on the moon sticks with pearl's growth -- including getting to know who her husband _really_ is for the first time -- it's an appealing character study . from its atmosphere to its acting , it's a nicely grown-up story of growing up , not just physically but emotionally . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
2	combine the talents of director robert altman and actors kenneth branagh and robert duvall , and you have the apparent recipe for a motion picture worth waiting for . but , although the gingerbread man is a finely-tuned example of mainstream entertainment , and holds the audience's interest for most of its running length , it is a little disappointing . perhaps the problem is that the story was written by john grisham , and , as one might expect , it doesn't stray far from the standard grisham formula . or maybe it's that altman has gotten lazy recently . following the less-than-stellar ready to wear and kansas city , the gingerbread man ( a blatantly commercial effort ) isn't likely to appease those questing for the next altman masterpiece . one of altman's strengths , most evident in films like nashville and short cuts , is character development , so it's no surprise that we are introduced to a gallery of interesting individuals . altman ratchets up the tension during this section of the film , providing a few genuine edge-of-the- seat moments . it's in the final half hour that the gingerbread man starts to lose its way . the denouement and ending , while in keeping with what we expect from a grisham-penned tale , are pedestrian , offering only contrived surprises . nevertheless , in part because i had invested so much into the characters over the film's better first two-thirds , i was able to accept , if not applaud , the resolution . the plot has its share of logical flaws , but that's standard for all but the very best thrillers . the gingerbread man's undeniable primary strength is the level of acting . branagh , whose training in shakespeare gives him a tendency to overact ( see mary shelly's frankenstein if you don't believe me ) , gives a perfectly-modulated performance under altman's direction . branagh's nick is strong , decisive , and obviously human . embeth davidtz , who has essayed a number of roles since her eye-opening turn in schindler's list , does her best work here since the holocaust drama , easily surpassing her bland turn in the recent fallen . ( this may be the only time hannah's acting hasn't stuck out like a sore thumb . ) the only flat portrayal belongs to famke janssen ( as nick's ex-wife ) , but at least she's better here than she was in deep rising . at its best , the gingerbread man evokes memories of alfred hitchcock , the master of suspense who used every tool at his disposal to trick , cajole , and manipulate the audience into a state of heightened anxiety . one of the mechanisms employed here by altman is the weather - - it always seems to be raining , and the approach of the hurricane promises even more wind and water . fortunately , the storm sequences are impressively filmed and serve to enhance the atmosphere , rather than drown it ( like in hard rain ) . although the gingerbread man has its faults , there are enough fine moments and solid performances to more than balance them out . while altman aficionados may be disappointed by the conventional nature of the production , fans of writer john grisham ( who gets story , but not screenplay , credit ) will probably feel right at home . the legal thriller has become grisham's home field , and the gingerbread man , with an accomplished director at the helm , is as worthwhile as anything he has helped bring to the screen . the result is an entertaining and sporadically engrossing two hours . - ingmar bergman 
1	there are also some interesting casting choices he makes such as , a cameo for angie dickinson as gwyneth's grandmother and the noted singer huey newton in a starring role , whose expressions and looks reminded me of sydney pollack . this story is the most bizarre and implausible , but it has the strength of bringing out a number of small truths that add up , allowing the film to maintain a quirky sense of justification for its messiness . its impact is helped greatly by the engagingly nuanced performances of giamatti and braugher . the two things this film has going for it in spades , is the lively karaoke music and the unpredictability of its comedy , which gives the film a very fresh feel , even overcoming the nonsense of its interconnected stories and awkward sense of drama . these stories don't exactly connect for these disenfranchised folks , but it shows what happens to them psychologically when they come to a crossroads in omaha , making it appear to be the super bowl for dreamers in the world of karaoke -- their chance to heal their wounded egos as they steal someone else's talent for a few moments and call it theirs . the film starts off in a karaoke bar in tulsa , where ricky is a karaoke hustler , if there is such an animal as that , it's new to me -- but his thing is to bet other performers that he can top them , betting a huge sum of money over the usual $100 first-place prize . there is also a trip to omaha for the winner , where the competition is national and the prize money is significantly higher at $5 , 000 , but considering the way money has been thrown around in contests with less skill than this one , this is still a very low figure as a payoff . she does a marvelous rendition of " bette davis eyes . " but their story was rather tame , as there was nothing touching about their relationship and nothing revealed that wasn't expected , it played as if something was left out but that it wasn't important to find out what that was . yet their chemistry was good together , making their story most watchable one . the story that seemed the most forced was the cabbie and the whore on the run one . this vignette took its dramatics too seriously and explained their obvious emergency relationship in too fine a matter for how absurd it all seemed . i must applaud the film for not emphasizing the competition at the contest , as so many recent commercial films have in such films , and for taking a chance and going for some dramatic fireworks in a screwball comedy . that it doesn't always come together as a fluid film , is pushed aside by how zany and entertaining it was , with a good sense of energy released through some risks that were taken by not trying to put together a familiar film . i have a good feeling about this film and think it will stay around as a cult favorite and grow in status over the years . 
1	screenplay : chris mcquarrie , bryan singer and michael feit dougan . director : bryan singer . public access is an ambitious , stylish film that manages to find itself both inches from brilliance and inches from complete impenitrability . it's a dark tale of family values gone awry , and manages to establish an effective tone of simmering menace . the problems really begin when that simmer should be turning into a boil . the first half of public access is thoroughly intriguing , introducing whiley in a manner that makes it clear that something about him is not quite right , but keeps you guessing as to what exactly it is . as long as whiley remains a mystery , public access is a gripping drama . what were whiley's motivations , or do they even matter ? a climactic confrontation between whiley and a vocal critic was disappointingly short on tension , and the pivotal montage which brings the film to a close seems so deliberately opaque that it's just off-putting . viewers of public access will likely find immediate similarities to david lynch's blue velvet . director and co-writer bryan singer seems not at all shy about paying homage to influences like lynch , alan parker and the coen brothers . unfortunately , he never quite combines all these elements into a style all his own . the interjection of a couple of eccentric public access programs is jarring , and leads the viewer to believe that public access is going to be * about * cable television , which it absolutely is not . nothing in singer's direction really stands out except lingering shots of a ceiling fan and a glass of water which scream " meaningful . " the technical credits are superb , particularly the evocative score and taut editing , both by san jose native john ottman . i do wish to single out ron marquette's performance as a creepy triumph . he provides a solid counterpoint to the naturalistic performances of the townspeople , and his rendering of whiley pritcher almost sells public access singlehandedly . when it comes right down to it , though , access isn't accessible enough , and it doesn't sprint to the finish . 
2	shown at the philadelphia festival of world cinema u . s . release date : june 1995 running length : 1 : 59 mpaa classification : not rated ( rape , violence , mature themes , sexual situations ) cast : seema biswas , nirmal pandey , manoj bajpai , rajesh vivek , raghuvir yadav , govind namdeo director : shekhar kapur producer : sundeep s . bedi screenplay : mala sen cinematography : ashok mehta music : nusrat fateh ali khan u . s . distributor : arrow releasing in hindi with subtitles controversy is swirling around bandit queen , likely to be one of 1995's most discussed features . supposedly based on the real-life experiences of a modern indian folk hero named phoolan devi , the authenticity of the film's script is now under attack by none other than the subject herself . at this point , there is enough confusion surrounding the factual accuracy of the movie that its claim to be " a true story " should be accepted with reservations . nevertheless , regardless of its historical veracity , bandit queen is an excellent examination of caste discrimination , human suffering , and the role of women in india's changing culture . the first is a quote shown on-screen at the film's start : " animals , drums , illiterates , low castes and women are worthy of being beaten . " the picture of human indignity and suffering painted by bandit queen is on par with that of schindler's list . as the nazis treated the jews like animals , so too do the upper caste indians regard those born into poverty and squalor . compared to some of the indignities experienced by devi , death would have been quick and merciful . when it comes , devi's revenge is indeed a dish best served cold . making the film was an undeniable challenge for director kapur , an upper-caste hindu who , along with writer mala sen , based as much of bandit queen on interpretations of what devi didn't say in her diaries as on what she did say . there is also no doubt that the movie will have a vastly different impact in its country of origin than in the west , where we bring a foreign cultural perspective to a viewing . but there's no question that this is the sort of picture capable of causing waves of world wide contention , regardless of how true or untrue particular elements are . fiction can often have as much impact as fact , especially if it is well-grounded in reality . tightly-paced , powerfully-written , and well-acted , bandit queen is a first-rate adventure movie . like schindler's list , there is no political diatribe here . the film manages to grip the audience in a way that no preachy commentary ever will . devi , as strikingly portrayed by actress seema biswas , becomes real , and it doesn't take long for us to feel her seething rage at the mountain of injustices rising above her . it is uncomfortable to sympathize with someone who becomes so ruthless and uncompromising , but that is the gut-wrenching path along which director kapur drags us . bandit queen is not for the squeamish , or for those who prefer not to be challenged or unsettled by a motion picture . because , whatever your feelings about the movie or its protagonist , bandit queen will not leave you apathetic . 
0	date released : 8/26/94 running length : 1 : 59 rated : r ( violence , language , sexual situations , mature themes , excessively gimmicky photography ) despite his reputation as one of america's foremost " serious " filmmakers , oliver stone's name under the " director " caption does not guarantee a good movie . i learned that lesson while enduring the seemingly-endless tedium of the doors , and was reminded of it during some of the long , drawn-out portions of jfk . however , nothing that stone has directed--or misdirected--prepared me for the grotesque mess that is natural born killers . his reaction is understandable . while it's impossible to tell what kind of movie this would have been served up " straight , " it's a safe bet that it couldn't have been worse . in its current form , natural born killers is treading uncomfortably close to even cowgirls get the blues territory , and that's not a good place for a movie to be . the problem is , this is a one- note movie . it repeatedly hammers home the same point until the audience is bludgeoned into senselessness . man bites dog attacked the subject with more finesse and wit . then there are the visuals--a virtual cornucopia of photographic tricks . stone frequently switches not only from color to black-and-white , but from one film stock to another . he uses a variety of angles and filters . animation , slow motion , fast motion , rear screen projection--he doesn't miss a gimmick . at times it becomes difficult , if not impossible , to focus on the story with all that's going on . used sparingly , these sorts of devices can be very effective ( see zentropa for an example ) . stone , however , doesn't know the meaning of moderation or subtlety , and opts instead for something that is excessive and self-indulgent . it's as if he wants to shout out the statement : " look at what i can do ! i'm an artist ! " ultimately , the story doesn't carry much importance . the actors aren't much more crucial than the plot , dwarfed as they are by the camerawork . there are some clever bits here and there . the i love mallory sitcom parody ( featuring rodney dangerfield and edie mcclurg ) is amusing--and a little sinister , especially considering how the laugh track is manipulated . the use of clips from old shows like leave it to beaver works , as do some of the animated inserts . the soundtrack's blend of more than seventy musical cues provides a balanced counterpoint to the visual blitz . however , the good parts of this film , meager as they are , can't do much to help . message or not , natural born killers is an example of narcissistic film making . next time , oliver , try to restrain yourself-at least a little . 
0	bruce paltrow's duets , a would-be comedy about competitive karaoke singing , is about as much fun to watch as a bad karaoke singer . actually , it's worse , since the karaoke singers in the film aren't bad enough to laugh at . instead , too many of them are so good that you wonder if they're lip-synching . with its low energy and its leaden script , the movie has almost nothing going for it except the presence of bruce's daughter gwyneth in the cast . watching the intelligent gwyneth paltrow trying to play a dumb character like liv is at best disconcerting and at worst embarrassing . about the only part of their routine that's memorable is liv's beatific smile . the movie's best on-going joke involves todd's inability to use any of his 800 , 000 frequent flyer miles . " it's a rush like you won't believe ! " replies one of its participants . one of the many problems with duets , besides being a comedy that's not funny , is that this " rush " is never present on the screen . the movie leaves us with one question . why did gwyneth paltrow agree to do this movie ? sometimes even parents have really bad ideas . duets runs 1 : 52 . it is rated r for language and some sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers . 
1	screenplay : mark verheiden . director : peter hyams . a muscular action hero with a thick accent stars in a science fiction film about traveling into the past to change the future . no , i'm not talking about the terminator , although i suspect the similarity is more than coincidental . jean-claude van damme has labored through several virtually indistinguishable testosterone fests without discovering his breakout hit , so timecop must have seemed like the perfect opportunity . and it will probably do what it was intended to do , expanding van damme's audience the way the terminator expanded arnold schwarzenegger's . it's an energetic film that doesn't skimp on the action , but it suffers from an over-convoluted storyline that pushes the logic meter * way * into the red zone . however , those are not the issues which hamper timecop most . there is more fundamental foolishness , like what exactly the t . e . c . either there has been an inordinate number of rogue timecops , or there was a spectacular level of stupidity involved in not destroying the other machine . one also wonders why assassins from the future can't be slightly less obtrusive than extras from the road warrior . while reuben is good working with sketchy material , the character appears too late and disappears too soon to leave any kind of impact on the story . everything about the fielding character feels contrived , sloppy and , worst of all , completely unnecessary . director peter hyams went a little nuts in the editing room , making some of van damme's fight scenes look like they were lit with a strobe , but they are mostly creative and well- choreographed ; only the final showdown drags on a bit . the special effects are sharp , and the computer-generated snap-back look to the characters' movements through time is inventive and well-handled . the production values are generally impressive , and action fans will not be too disappointed . the real pleasant surprise of timecop turns out to be the acting of jean-claude van damme . yes , that's right , i said acting . though still sometimes difficult to understand through his belgian accent , van damme is an appealing performer who looks comfortable on screen , something steven seagal has yet to accomplish . timecop isn't exactly a demanding film for an actor , but van damme shows that he can provide texture , something a bit more substantive than roundhouse kicks . he also gets to work off a suitably nasty villain in ron silver , who is perfectly cast , and has a nice chemistry with the too-little-seen mia sara . it's too bad timecop often feels bloated and preposterous , because there's a bit of heart lurking beneath the hardware . it's just a bit too uneven to take advantage of its strengths . 
1	tales from the crypt presents bordello of blood it's curious how one of the most inventive made-for-cable tv series ( hbo's tales from the crypt ) could turn into one of the most toothless movie series to haunt multiplexes . bordello of blood is the second tales from the crypt feature , following in the dismal wake left by 1995's demon knight , one of that year's worst pictures . at least this followup keeps to the basic sprit of the program that spawned it . bordello of blood is a macabre , jokey affair that could give buffy the vampire slayer a run for its money as the silliest undead story of the decade . comic dennis miller is on hand as rafe guttman , the hero of the piece . miller , who got bumped off early in the net , stays around much longer here , which is fortunate , since his wisecracking is bordello of blood's most obvious asset . miller makes this movie ; without him , i would be fishing for nice things to say . several of his one-liners are legitimately funny , and the offhand manner in which he confronts the vampires is worth at least a smile . chris sarandon plays a rather dull televangelist . the film makes a lot of jokes at the expense of the religious right , but , considering that it's such an easy target , the humor seems recycled . frankly , there isn't much of a plot . the exposition exists for three purposes : to gather a lot of half-naked women together , to display as much gore as can be crammed into ninety minutes ( actually , from dusk till dawn's total probably tops bordello of blood's ) , and to give miller an arena for his verbal ripostes . the whole thing works in a campy sort of way , but this movie definitely should not be confused with " good " cinema . just because it's bad , though , doesn't mean that it can't have a certain entertainment value . presumably , that's exactly what the film makers intended . men go in , but they don't come out -- at least not in one piece . they are , i presume , too worked up by lilith's unique method of french kissing . it's a heartfelt sort of activity . i'm almost embarrassed to admit that i liked parts of bordello of blood -- it is , after all , a pretty sick motion picture . alas , the sense of bloody good fun gets stretched too thin . there's not enough material here to sustain the running length , and the film goes through dead patches ( most of which occur when miller isn't on screen ) . all of the stuff with chris sarandon is a waste of time that should have been relegated to the cutting room floor -- except that would have trimmed bordello of blood to an unacceptably short sixty minutes or so . so , although this movie is an improvement over the dreadful demon knight ( then again , almost anything would be ) , it still hasn't convinced me that tales of the crypt belongs on the big screen . as for the film's commercial potential , i'm afraid it hasn't got much . at best , much like buffy , it will attain cult status . such is , after all , the deserved fate of movies like this . 
1	screenplay : mike myers & michael mccullers . director : jay roach . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , adult humor ) running time : 95 minutes . first , this must be said : i was wrong about the original austin powers : international man of mystery . in 1997 , i gave the film an unenthusiastic , noting that writer/star mike myers' infatuation with old " saturday night live " sketches and characters blunted the truly inspired comic moments . i'm still pretty comfortable with my rating , though a recent second viewing suggested i may have been slightly stingy ( dr . evil alone is too hilarious not to warrant at least a mild recommendation ) . no , i was wrong in a suggestion i made for improvement . austin powers : the spy who shagged me proves that a different temporal setting wouldn't have changed anything , because myers used a different temporal setting and _didn't_ change anything . faster than you can say basil exposition ( michael york ) , austin has a time machine of his own , and pops back to swinging london . the exact nature of that something evil is , of course , entirely beside the point . the spy who shagged me is at its goofy best when it's most self-aware , mocking film conventions of all sorts . when myers finds a comic target -- starbucks , the music of the 80s , star wars' opening narrative crawl -- he knows how to use it . the original austin powers was at its most wearying when myers took a joke and beat all semblance of life out of it for several agonizing minutes . he's at it again this time , and he's using identical gags he already exhausted in the previous film . even the original's best sequence -- the evil family therapy session -- is revisited as a " jerry springer " episode . and when myers does come up with a new concept , he still insists on using it twice , or twice as long as necessary . we've all come to expect sequels that recycle huge chunks of the original , usually in the action genre . when a satirical comedy loses its sense of discovery , there's not much reason for it to exist . the one major change is the 1969 setting , though there doesn't seem to be much point to it . mostly , it's a lot more of the same . that's a bad thing when we're talking about making the same mistakes twice . austin powers fans will surely be ready to forgive myers' lapses in imagination . others will be left trying to figure out where this promising series could actually reach its potential . maybe the 1950s next time ? see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	the happy but silly rex harrison musical doctor dolittle has been remade into half of a good movie , albeit without any songs . the new movie's menagerie of talking animals , while not exactly babe cute , are quite funny . if the animals could have just eaten all of the humans in the beginning , the animals could have starred in a first-rate production . the terminally boring humans with their dismal lines and their lethargic acting kill an otherwise promising picture . when the animals talk , prepare to laugh . sometimes the humor is directed only at the adults as when one dog in the pound confesses , " i am keyser soze . " " please don't fix me , " he whines . " i won't look at another girl ever . i swear . " the animals are good at physical comedy as well . jumping like a perpetual motion machine , he keeps demanding with a hyperactive cadence , " throw me the ball ; throw me the ball . " the movie's jokes contain so much crude and sexual humor that the filmmakers appear to be targeting an audience just a year or two shy of teenagehood , but the animal antics seem aimed more at the kindergarten and younger grade school set . the one-joke movie wears out its welcome quickly . there are many laughs , but there would have been a lot more if we could have gotten rid of those abysmal humans . it is rated pg-13 for profanity and crude humor and would be fine for kids around nine and up . my son jeffrey , age 9 , laughed long and hard during the movie . 
2	sirens is a witty , fanciful , and wonderfully upbeat comedy with a dramatic side as well . the women , i believe , are all relatively newcomers to the screen . all of the performances were delightful . the nude models were played like pixies . when they smile , joy leaps through your heart . many great scenes in the show . the pixies swinging in the glimmering moonlight was magical . there was a drunk who said an unprintable 2 word phrase again and again that was very funny . the cinematography ( geoff burton ) was superb . the night scenes with the exaggerated back lighting of the moon were lovely . duigan directed them so that it seemed as if these actors and actresses had been working together forever . it is rated r . if a lot of female and male full frontal nudity is a problem for you , then skip sirens since it is best described as a very nude enchanted april ; otherwise , i recommend this show to you and give it * * * . it is a fine show for teenagers unless they are sensitive to nudity . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : march 14 , 1994 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	frankie starlight is ambitious , and , as is often true of movies that attempt too much , it's only partially successful . parts work ; parts don't . individual enjoyment of frankie starlight will largely depend upon which aspects of the film you choose to focus on . frankie starlight's ambitious agenda is to transform the events of nightstalk from text to screen images by means of lengthy flashbacks . characterization becomes spotty as the film gropes for an anchor . the last third of the movie is by far the best . there's more emotional depth to frank's relationship with his soul mate than is initially obvious , with director michael lindsay-hogg handling this aspect of his film adeptly . the actors give heartfelt performances and the script avoids the trap of emotional artifice which ruins so many screen romances . frank eventually becomes an amateur astronomer , and many of the film's best sequences take place on a rooftop with thousands of points of light twinkling in the darkened canopy above . more scenes like these would have been welcome . connections , both made and missed , and the vagaries of life that lead us to react differently to the same people in diverse circumstances , form frankie starlight's thematic backbone . as with most of the film's other aspects , these are generally successful as they pertain to frank , but rarely work with bernadette . parillaud's acting is too flat , and the sketchiness of the screenplay , which follows her life in broad strokes with few details , doesn't help . we're sure how and why frank connects with others ; the same can rarely be said about his mother . frankie starlight is more satisfying taken as a whole than when its individual parts are examined . the film is flawed , but there's still enough magic and genuine emotion to make for a pleasant movie-going experience . affability is perhaps frankie starlight's strongest quality . no matter how many problems you uncover along the way , when the final credits roll , you're more likely to be smiling than frowning . 
1	a minimal story that is too thin for a feature film . it is about urban deterioration and alienation in taiwan as seen just seven days before 2000 and leading up to the 'new millennium . ' it makes one act like a bug , crawling on all fours and so on , as the victim first shows flu-like symptoms . at the 1998 cannes film festival , this taiwanese-french drama won a fipresci award , given by international critics . what i liked best about it were the half dozen musical numbers sung by grace chang , as the two tenants lip-synch and dance along to the tunes . the film would be interrupted by the fantasy scenes , where the dressed-up protagonists would go into their lively cabaret-like song and dance routine . some of the lively songs to counter the non-action scenes were : 'oh calypso , ' 'go away don't come back , ' 'i want you to-what i want is your love , ' 'gesundheit , ' and 'i don't care who you are . ' this film was initiated as part of the french tv series of one-hour end-of-millennium dramas . its appeal will probably be most appreciated by the music lovers of those old hong kong films ( grace chang was a popular singer in the china of the 1950s ) , and those admirers of french directors rivette and demy , whose musicals are also followed by strange stories and a dead-pan humor . it also should appeal to those who want to see the unusual , and their reward might be that this is a film that makes them think they have something to think about . for me , nothing much happened in this intriguing kafka-like idea for a film to rise above its leaky promises . it needed more of a story and protagonists with more personality , in order for it to feel more alive . 
1	the fifth element uses one of the newest tricks in the science fiction motion picture handbook : perform a visual and aural assault on viewers in the vain hope that they won't notice the lack of substance , logic , and intelligence . for a few recent examples of where this tactic has been employed , check out stargate , independence day , and judge dredd . the fifth element , the summer of 1997's first big-budget disappointment , is right at home in such company . a lot of money was spent on this film , but $100 million doesn't guarantee a good product . maybe someone should have thought of spending a few more dollars on a better script . going into the film , i was guardedly optimistic . as a result of what i'd seen in the two-minute theatrical trailer , visions of blade runner danced in my head ( i guarantee that no one in their right mind would make such a ludicrous association after seeing the fifth element ) . i figured that if anyone could handle the task of putting together a rousing science fiction adventure with bruce willis in the lead , it was besson . alas , such is not the case . what can i say about the storyline ? there's not much there , and what there is , doesn't make a lot of sense . if you see the fifth element , do not , under any circumstances , attempt to reason out what's going on . in general , science fiction tales play fast and loose with reality , but here , it's so flagrant that even a moment's intelligent consideration of what's on the screen will shatter any hope of suspending disbelief . nothing can stop this nearly-omnipotent enemy ( which looks like the genesis planet from the star trek movies ) except the fifth element -- the most powerful weapon ever devised . the fifth element is populated by all manner of flashed , bangs , and booms . new york city , circa 2200 , has been rendered with eye-popping splendor by the effects wizards at digital domain . ( check out rush hour in the future if you think it's bad now ! ) bright colors -- reds , oranges , and yellows -- are in evidence everywhere , from bruce willis' outfit to milla jovovich's hair . on a purely visceral level , it's impossible to deny that the fifth element has an impact . when it comes time to discuss the rest of the movie , however , there's not much to talk about . when a wisecracking actor like bruce willis and a hammy performer like gary oldman are reduced to ineffectual bystanders , there's a problem . willis and oldman don't have much to do , and , when they're on screen , they fade into the background , dwarfed by the special effects . willis , whose john mclane is the die hard series , is used to taking center stage , but he can't compete with the visual busy-ness of the fifth element , and that makes him a pretty dull hero . meanwhile , with her fiery hair and occasionally-revealing costumes , jovovich makes an impression , although her effectiveness has little to do with acting and less to do with dialogue ( she doesn't have much to say ) . only chris tucker , who plays an insanely energetic , over-the-top talk show host ( a loquacious dennis rodman in outer space ) manages to hold his own amidst the digital chaos , but his outrageousness starts to wear thin after about two minutes . i will give besson some credit . he never takes things too seriously , which is a good idea , because a somber version of the fifth element would have made it a candidate for the year's bottom 10 list . the director , working from a comic book-type script that he co-wrote with robert mark kamen ( and which bears a certain resemblance to one of the segments of heavy metal ) , injects a ton of offbeat , sporadically- effective humor into the movie , frequently causing the fifth element to cross over the line into self-parody . this unique approach kills any possible sense of adventure or suspense ( the numerous action scenes are obligatory and perfunctory , and never remotely exciting ) , but it at least offers something unusual . after all , in keeping with the " epic " sweep demanded by such an obese budget , the film had to clock in at over two hours , even though there's no excuse for a movie with so little going on to last for so long . at least the payoff is worthwhile in a campy sense . where else can you see sweat rung from a handkerchief become integral to saving the world ? besson may have misfired with the fifth element , but at least he does it with flair and a sense of humor . 
2	screenplay : malcolm bradbury . director : john schlesinger . cold comfort farm is directed with such sparkle and confidence that i almost couldn't believe john schlesinger was behind the camera . . . at least not the john schlesinger whose recent contributions to the cinematic canon were suspense misfires like pacific heights , the innocent and eye for an eye . even in his glory days of midnight cowboy , the day of the locust and marathon man , one would hardly say that " light-hearted " was an adjective applicable to his work . yet here we find schlesinger tackling the much-beloved stella gibbons novel , a parody with a giddy and irreverent tone , and nailing it . cold comfort farm is thoroughly entertaining and consistently surprising . a literary satire is a real challenge to film -- it's like trying to pull the humor out of that annual contest to duplicate hemingway's prose style and put it on screen -- but screenwriter malcolm bradbury has come up with the clever premise of following flora's budding writing career . grasping at the perfect metaphor for a sunset ( she can never quite figure out what " the golden orb " is supposed to do ) over her open d . h . lawrence novels , flora allows us a bit of insight into the florid writing gibbons was winking at . but cold comfort farm is even more successful at turning the conventions of those genres' plots upside down . those secrets turn out to be red herrings ; it doesn't matter _what_ they are , only that everyone at cold comfort farm is living under the weight of those long-past events , waiting for someone like flora to come along and push each of them in the direction of the one thing that will make them genuinely excited . the result is some hilarious moments and sharp performances , as we watch amos improvising a sermon before his church of ( literally ) quivering brethren , and seth grabbing his chance at big-screen stardom , and the characters are rendered with a refreshing lack of concern over whether they are being condescended to . that is a criticism some detractors have leveled against cold comfort farm , and i think they are missing the point . but schlesinger and bradbury show gibbons' characters with an eye to the basic desire for happiness which flora is trying to uncover . flora brings a breath of life to cold comfort farm , and schlesinger's cold comfort farm brings a breath of life to a decidedly musty film season . 
1	a coke can as soccer ball ? writer/director khyentse norbu's the cup is an innocent little picture that suffers from being a one-idea movie . if the characters in it were not monks , then the only reaction would be to write off the formulaic picture as a lame and amateurish version of the kids' big game movie that has been done hundreds of times before and usually much better . whether the mere fact that the cast is composed of monks can supply enough charm to make you ignore all of its shortcomings , only you can judge . for myself , the charm quickly wore thin . sounding harmless enough , he gives permission for the event . ending in the traditional big game , this time a televised one , the predictable movie has few surprises . as soon as you see their rag-tag electronics setup , you know they'll have trouble with it . and given the feel-good tone of the story , you can be sure that it will be resolved successfully . the film is in tibetan and hindi with english subtitles . it is rated g and would be suitable for all ages . 
2	with a mostly female cast and a poetic title , it might be easy to assume that paradise road is a 1997 version of mike newell's effervescent enchanted april . however , apart from those stated similarities , there's little to connect the two films . paradise road shifts the focus to the lesser-known , but no less inhumane , conditions in the pacific . based on the memoirs of survivors , this movie peels away one more layer of the atrocities associated with the second world war . and the means that the prisoners devise to lift their spirits are , to say the least , unique . yet , even though paradise road is ultimately about the triumph over adversity , the script never forgets that for everyone who overcomes seemingly-impossible obstacles , there are many who stumble along the way , never to rise again . the exceptionally strong cast showcases american , british , and australian actresses , all of whom show an astonishing willingness to appear in physically unflattering circumstances ( no makeup , hair and skin caked with drying mud ) . paradise road is less a tearjerker than an honest examination of the bonds that are formed during extreme situations . although there are some heart-wrenching moments , and several scenes of potentially- disturbing violence , the film never descends to the level of cheap melodrama . instead , it opts for something deeper and more meaningful by allowing us to follow a group of well-rounded characters on a journey with a strong spiritual component . paradise road not only pays tribute to the human will to live , but it is a testament to music's lasting power to heal and uplift . ultimately , paradise road isn't as deeply sad or depressing as a holocaust film , for , although several characters do not survive the movie , the goal of the japanese is punishment and humiliation , not genocide . and , while one of paradise road's themes is the barbarity of war , it manages to present its case without demonizing the japanese ( indeed , it goes to great pains to paint a few of them as sympathetic ) . instead , the film succeeds by humanizing the kinds of survivors who are often pictured as wretched , faceless victims . paradise road owes its existence to writer/director bruce beresford , one of the most inconsistent film makers working today . 
1	producers : laurence mark and roger birnbaum . director : mark steven johnson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 113 minutes . at least they prepared me right off the bat , right there in the credits . i didn't need to wait long to understand how many liberties , thanks to an admirably forthright screen credit : " suggested by the novel _a prayer for owen meany_ . " not " inspired by , " not " based on , " not even " loosely based on " like the 1995 travesty of _the scarlet letter_ . i wish i had known johnson was taking suggestions , because i might have offered a few . right about there , all similarity to the source material ends . sure , a few individual details remain , notably a school christmas pageant which goes dreadfully awry , but even that element is given an ill-advised twist . the film's simon , like his literary counterpart , has a preternaturally mature sense of existential purpose , an almost arrogant belief that god intends great things for him . it makes no sense for that character -- who schemes in the novel to be the baby jesus in the nativity play because he thinks only he can do the role justice -- to be turned into a grumpy and reluctant christ-child . johnson goes for the cheap laughs of projectile vomiting and pre-pubescent groping rather when he should be trying to maintain some consistency in his characterizations . i don't mean to suggest that simon birch is an awful film , particularly if you walk in like most viewers with no knowledge of irving's novel . the friendship between joe and simon is unique and well-developed , though the more experienced mazzello makes first-time screen actor smith look quite self-conscious at times . the first half of simon birch is generally satisfying , a sprightly and quirky reminiscence cast in the autumn tones of aaron e . schneider's cinematography . it's the latter half , which diverges most sharply from irving's story , that goes most horribly wrong . the music score ( by the ever-cloying marc shaiman ) begins reminding us every several seconds that it's time to weep , eventually building to the orchestral equivalent of yanking out your nose hairs one at a time . with its " oh by the way , in case you're a complete moron , here's the moral of the story " punch line of dialogue , simon birch is less emotionally cathartic than it is emotionally insulting . johnson doesn't just streamline irving's sprawling narrative , he dumb-lines it , casting everything in the broadest tear-jerker strokes . what a waste of a singular story to turn it into a trite hallmark card of a dramatic experience . the power of suggestion sure can make people do foolish things . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
0	this wasn't a bad film , as much as it was a mediocre one . it is taken from a paper thin story by the renown pulp writer of the vox populi , john grisham ( the screenplay is credited to al hayes , but rumored to have been re-written by robert altman ) . it was directed with misdirection by the legendary director robert altman ( m * a * s * h ( 69 ) , mccabe & mrs . miller ( 71 ) , the long goodbye ( 73 ) , nashville ( 75 ) ) , who has never directed a thriller quite like this one before , and shows with this film that his enormous talent , probably , does not lie with this genre . the only thing that saves this movie from being a complete bust is the marvelously energetic cast . they took this inane formula story seriously and did a fine job in keeping it going . branagh might be a capable british shakespearian actor , but he has a tendency to chew up his scenes , which he does here , to the further detriment of the film . that altman did such a haphazard job in directing this thriller , is proven in the first fifteen minutes of the movie , when he gives away the plot by anxiously holding his attention too long on an obvious set-up situation . as a result , with all the tension taken out of the film , in the very beginning of it , the only reason for seeing the rest of the film has become dissolved into watching how well the actors could work without a well-developed story . when the best part of the movie for me , is watching the hurricane take place , and i know that the weather conditions has little to do with the story , except as setting a mood , then i'm certain that i haven't been swept away by this film . there was , as far as i could tell , no particular character development of the principal players , no intense drama taking place , no new insights into the judicial system , or compassion felt for any one remotely connected with this story . i found myself trying to figure out why there is such a huge market for grisham's stories , and it sure beats me . . . the film becomes an actor's studio venture , with the following characters acting out their supporting roles with varying degrees of effectiveness : clyde pell ( robert downey jr . ) appears to be the most likable one in the film , playing a fun-loving alcoholic private dick and buddy of magruder . they all make an earnest contribution to a film that would have served altman better if it wasn't so thin a story he was telling . 
0	" in all , the filmmaker shot 115 minutes of interlocking scenes to cover all the possibilities of [mr . payback] ; just 20 minutes make it on screen . a viewer would have to see this film 25 to 30 times before it became repetitive . " mr . payback , billed as " the world's first interactive movie " , is part motion picture , part video game , and all gimmick . roughly once every sixty seconds during the twenty-odd minute running length , the audience is given a chance to vote for one of three options displayed on-screen . it's like the cinematic version of a " choose your own adventure " book . the short film is about the length of an average tv sitcom . unfortunately , the intelligence level isn't much higher . if not for the novelty of pushing the buttons on the joystick , this would easily be one of the worst theatrical experiences of the year . it's juvenile , poorly acted , and the script seems aimed at the average thirteen-year old , hormone-crazed male . payback is technically inferior to most low-budget pictures . colors are oversaturated , glare is noticeable , and the image is frequently blurred . the audio is loud , but little more can be said in its defense . michael tavera's score sounds as cheap and shoddy as the entire production appears . one or two jokes work , but that's a poor payoff even for something this short . as a movie , mr . as the introduction of a new form of entertainment , it's scarcely more impressive . after this viewing , it's my opinion that " interactive " movies should die a quick death , going the way of " smell-o-vision " . perhaps the experience would have been more palatable had i been drunk . that's the only way i can imagine getting anything worthwhile out of this . 
2	" mirrors should reflect a little before throwing back images . " georges auric , cocteau's lifelong musical collaborator , said that he wanted to compose the score for an animated cartoon . cocteau was asked to provide a scenario . this became " the blood of a poet , " still one of the most widely viewed of all cocteau's screenworks . there has never been a film quite like le sang d'un poete . cocteau used all his energy and his diverse talents in a medium that was new to him , as this film represented an aesthetic milestone in his career . was it nonsense or serious filmmaking ? in my opinion , a little of both , though the result of the film is a serious work . this 60 minute film is ostensibly , a work on the nature of creating art . special weightless effects were obtained by camera trickery to show the little girl flying up to the ceiling and the poet moving painfully along the corridor wall . once cocteau discovered that he could turn shooting disasters into excellent footage , he was off on a career of making films that carried his trait of creating trick shots : the miraculous mirror and mercury scene in orphee , the live arms holding the candelabra from the walls of la belle et la bete , and the accelerated time sequences of flowers opening in le testament d'orphee are only a few examples of the trick shots he used in his later films . for cocteau , poetry is a coat-of-arms . the film ends with the message : mortal tedium of immortality . in the last frame , an industrial chimney shown in the beginning of the film , finally collapses and all material things are crushed . so much of this film is mysterious and vague , undoubtedly autobiographical in content and motif : cocteau himself always denied the presence of hidden symbolism in the film , but word got about that it had anti-christian undercurrents . this was really not so , according to cocteau , but the false rumor did its damage . it greatly distressed the noailles . the life-line of the movie is its imagery , which can be interpreted many different ways , emphasizing cocteau's view that art disclaimed the world of ordinary appearances and projected vision to be a symbolic representation that must be continually changing , because if it doesn't it will be dead like classicism is and it will cease to exist . the director was afraid that the avant-garde movement would die one day like all other artistic movements have . because of its unusual theme and style and unpredictability , this is a film that deserves the high accolades many film critics have bestowed upon it . it resolutely shows how the filmmaker communicates into the spirit world , and he does so without being pretentious . 
2	in an age in which comedies seem to come only in two flavors , mean and meaner ( or crude and cruder ) , christopher guest's best in show is a delightful change of pace . it's a good-spirited comedy that gets laughs the old-fashioned way with sweetness and charm . guest , whose specialty is mockumentaries , acted in this is spinal tap and acted in , directed and co-wrote waiting for guffman , which he does again for best in show . with a terrific ensemble cast , many of whom appeared in waiting for guffman , the story moves from one hilarious episode to another . although christopher guest and eugene levy are credited as the writers , the press notes say that most of the lines were purposely improvised , which adds to the mock authenticity . or is it the other way round ? no one can play the hyperactive bitch role with more charm and grace than posey , who may be best known for her role as tom hank's live-in girlfriend in you've got mail . the beauty of the casting is the way that the actors don't seem like actors at all but just ordinary folks . and the most ordinary of the lot is the movie's co-writer eugene levy , who plays gerry fleck , a gregarious bad-dresser . at our press screening , one of the critics got so into it that he yelled , " oh shut-up ! " best in show is the kind of movie that has you forgetting that it is a movie . i don't want to give too much away , but the winner of the big show is a real dog . after the canine equivalent of the big game ending , the movie has an extended epilogue that is perhaps the best part of the picture . but with a film this funny , it is hard to pick favorites . it is rated pg-13 for language and sex-related material and would be fine for kids around 11 and up . 
0	douglas fairbanks plays his first action hero role as zorro , the sort of part he will play for the rest of his film career , before this very popular film he was cast only in light comedies . he is dressed in a black mask-and- cape , which gave the role a certain amount of appeal to audiences . the film is not much on character study , instead it's filled with action sequences and a melodramatic love story between zorro , who hides his true identity of being the son of the aristocratic rancher don alejandro ( de gray ) , and the sweet lolita pukido ( marguerite ) . there is no mistake about who the goodguys and who the badguys are in this childlike adventure story . it reminded me of a charlie chaplin routine , the one where he's the tramp and is kicking the cop in his behind . the film disappointed me in many ways , not the least being , that his plan to help the poor , seemed misplaced , and that this was more a story of aristocrats and those of wealth versus bad politicians rather than the robin hood story it projected itself to be . it was really a stretch to believe that the noble zorro was anything but a rich aristocrat having a bit of sport , and finding love with someone he could have easily found love with anyway without going through his masquerade . the story itself was a cliche , featuring his cardboard-typed father wanting his son not to be an idler and make something of himself , while the son feigns being fatigued all the time and acting effeminate , performing silly magic tricks when he should be seriously courting the eligible senorita his father fixed him up with . it was the type of part you can almost expect to see in a film like this , and one that is void of any real human emotions . there are no surprises in this predictable costume actioner , but it is pleasantly shot in b&w with a tinted look to it . it should please those who like their films to be lighthearted . because it was such a successful film box-office wise and was a precursor to the type of film hollywood is noted for putting forth , it could be interesting just to see how this silent yarn compares with the viewer's take on the more modern action films . 
2	acting like loud-mouthed frat boys , these guys work the phones cold calling other guys to offer them deals that , correctly , sound too good to be true . that's it . " and if you not willing to lie and cajole every second , you're not cut out for their firm . in his one emotional scene towards the end , his acting comes across as awkward and staged . but the film's bright script and crisp pacing more than compensate for this weakness in the casting . " clean up your life , then we can talk . " but they don't appear to enjoy it much . " you're got to admit to yourself it's not charity work and enjoy it or get out , " she advises him . the ending is wrapped up too neatly and conventionally , but , up until then , the movie takes you on an exhilarating ride . the spirit of the film is best encapsulated in the only extracurricular activity that the guys really seem to enjoy . the film would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
1	although crude , this reoccurring scene manages to be funny every time . williams is hilarious . he mispronounces every term possible and manages to keep the audience in stitches with every joke . the director of the movie , chris columbus , has done many good movies , but my personal favorites of his are mrs . in nine months , i am sad to report , he delivers a highly uneven movie . sometimes the jokes work and other times , they are quite tedious . the script , also by chris columbus , is based on a french movie of the same name . columbus's script oscillated between great humor and mean spiritedness . the script did shine in parts . it was fresh , fast paced , and enormously funny . for an inside joke , watch what is on the movie marquee when they race past it in one of the scenes . finally , if you see the picture , stay through the credits , and you will get to see the baby pictures of all of the stars . several of the characters were so obnoxious that every time they were on the screen you wanted to stare at your feet . the entire dwyer family was in that category . marty dwyer was played by tom arnold at his absolute worst , and gail dwyer was acted by joan cusack who gave a miserable performance . the dwyer children could be poster kids for planned parenthood . in addition to the excellent acting of williams , i thought grant and moore were both quite good and believable . everyone knows grant's work , but people may not be familiar with moore's . the scenes not involving the dwyer family were well paced . all traces of the dwyer family should have been obliterated . i give a mild thumbs up to nine months nevertheless . the two lead characters plus williams were worth going to see . i award the movie * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

0	ask the typical moviegoer about a film , and what you will be told about are the stars and the plot . with few exceptions , the director is never mentioned . and the writers are totally ignored . excess baggage can serve as an object lesson in the importance of an intelligent script and a director with a sense of vision . for stars the picture was to have the talented alicia silverstone and christopher walken , and the setup for the story showed great promise . the resulting film , however , leaves much to be desired . screenwriters max d . adams , dick clement and ian la frenais fashion the outline of their characters but never bother to fill them in . the dialog is as sparse as it is meaningless , making the movie seem like a partially finished body of work that was rushed into production before it was completed . director marco brambilla , whose only other film was demolition man , crafts a story without context or compass . the film appears to be a dark comedy , but dark comedies have impressive atmospherics and are , shall we say , funny . this remarkably humorless movie has a laugh count of one -- an unprintable line of silverstone's that occurs 45 minutes into the film . jean-yves escoffier's pedestrian cinematography has no discernible look to it , rendering it as uninviting as the soliloquies of the actors . someone to guide me through life . silverstone brings nothing to the role and rarely rises above her poorly written part . her character , like all of the characters in the story , is unsympathetically drawn . the movie is populated by people who are more walking enigmas than flesh-and-blood human beings . if an unexpected tornado had killed all of the characters , none of them would have been worth mourning . this sounds better than it is due to the director's inability to stage compelling scenes . rarely is what they say worth hearing , so perhaps the paucity of lines is a blessing in disguise . benicio del toro , as the thief , sleepwalks through most of the picture , waking periodically to mumble some incomprehensible lines . he will speak the lines written , but he will not show one scintilla of emotion . when christopher walken shows up as emily's uncle ray , the film briefly looks promising again , since walken is the master of the creepy . the director manages to confuse walken too . the only differences is that he looks incredibly sad . you would be too if you were stuck in this movie . when the inevitable conclusion finally comes , it is not clear what the director of this sleep-inducing picture had intended to accomplish . his slightly mean-spirited film wasn't funny , gave no message and touched no emotional nerves . i left as confused as the actors . excess baggage runs 1 : 41 . it is rated pg-13 for violence , drinking , and sexual dialog . the film would be fine for teenagers and those a bit younger . i do not recommend the picture , and i give it a generous * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	even today , it remains a popular video rental in this country . the press kit likens its restoration work to that for the hugely popular star wars special edition series . rather than add visuals to existing scenes as lucas did , petersen includes much more already existing footage . the original release of das boot ran 2 : 29 . the director's cut adds a full hour , and the rumor is that the director originally wanted to add two hours . what is similar to the star wars restoration is the treatment of the sound . petersen and company completely redesigned and re-recorded new sound effects . the result is impressive . the original sound received one of the film's five oscar nominations so the foundation for the digital remastering is substantial . there is no question that the changed sound improves the picture . toward the end of the review , i'll compare the original with the remake in terms of the material added . in many films the director does not play a dominant role ; liar liar was one recent example . in others , such as last year's secrets & lies , the director takes total control and molds the film into his vision . he went on to hollywood where he came up with several thrillers -- the best being in the line of fire with clint eastwood , john malkovich , and rene russo . the trailers look quite promising . prochnow gives a brilliant performance as the stoic captain who takes a cynical view of the war and his role in it . " like i'm on a children's crusade . " even with a large cast , the director manages to make the characters distinguishable and engaging . the simple but chillingly realistic script succeeds not through its memorable lines , of which there are precious few , but because of the situations it creates . the ensemble cast does the rest . remember , a submarine is like library . there is no talking allowed when it is open for business . instead of dialog we have some of the most complex and emotive facial expressions in any film . petersen says his vision for the film was , " to show the gritty and terrible reality of war and to combine it with a highly entertaining story and fast-paced action style that would pull audiences into the experience of these young men . " no matter whose side you were on in ww ii , these actors earn your empathy . moreover , petersen's engrossing storytelling abilities will have you on the edge of your seat for the entire picture . during the battle scenes i found my mouth kept hanging open as i wondered if this was going to be the depth charge that would blow them to smithereens . in 1982 das boot was the most expensive german film ever made up to that time . the result aimed for realism , not flash . the chief criticism of the picture stems from its main attribute : it is , arguably , the most claustrophobic film ever constructed . and yet , many small scenes , such as the one of the crew singing their favorite song , " it's a long way to tipperary , " illustrates the crew's humanity . although certainly a technical tour de force , the film occupies a much more important place in cinematic history . it shows up on many best films of all times lists , and other directors like steven spielberg cite its influence on their work . in one of the best anti-war films ever , there is no preaching against war . the film makes its powerful statement without needing to proclaim its message . when the movie was originally released i saw it first with subtitles and then in a dubbed version . although the dubbing was well done , the subtitled version is much better . and , i am thankful to report , the director's cut is subtitled . one of the beauties of it having been fifteen years since i saw the movie is that i had forgotten most of the details and remembered only the impressions it made on me . i will not reveal the ending in the hopes that you either have forgotten it or have never seen it . i found the ending surprising , but perfect . i promised to tell you which version i preferred -- the original or the director's cut . first , let me say that i cannot imagine your not wanting to see this director's cut if you have any serious interest in film . it is an expansive vision of a seminal picture that demands to be seen . i loved the director's cut and give it my highest rating . all of this notwithstanding , the original version with its tighter focus is the better of the two . the restoration , however , does have the improved soundtrack , and the original can no longer be seen in theaters . although das boot is a picture that can work on a small screen , its impact can only be fully felt in a theater . see it before it moves to video . i suspect its theatrical run will be brief so act now or you may never again have the chance . it is rated r for war violence , rear male nudity and some profanity . it would be fine for teenagers . i give the film my strongest recommendation and top rating of * * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , sexual situations ) running time : 101 minutes . my fellow americans is a buddy comedy . it is a bickering buddy comedy . it is a bickering-buddies-on-the-road comedy . in short , my fellow americans has about as generic a basic premise as there is in hollywood . so how does it end up so improbably entertaining ? because when it comes to film-making , story isn't even half the story -- execution is king . my fellow americans uses the familiar plot as a starting point , adds a script with just enough lively turns , and casts two consummate professionals in the lead roles . the result is a simple but engaging studio comedy , energized by the wonderful pairing of jack lemmon and james garner . you're going to see a lot of critics referring to my fellow americans as grumpy old presidents , and it's not just because jack lemmon is on board that comparisons to the grumpy old . . . films are appropriate . the most notable similarity is that my fellow americans also bases much of its humor on the notion that senior citizens spewing forth profanities are intrinsically hilarious ; no fewer than nineteen separate expletives season the dialogue of lemmon and garner . it is an unfortunate decision , if for no other reason than that it is unnecessary . political rivals should have more personalized gibes at their disposal , and indeed the script features a few nice zingers aimed at the stereotypes of each party . it would have been nice to see more -- and more pointed -- barbs , particularly like those aimed at haney's dim-witted vice-president ( john heard ) , whose mispronunciation of a single word may provide the film's biggest laugh . insult humor only goes as far as the slingers of the insults , though , and my fellow americans rises well above its material simply because lemmon and garner bring out the best in each other . lemmon's kramer is the more complete character , a politician who so desperately needs approval that he has become an over-eager joke . while kramer is the guy you can be sure promised everything to everybody , garner's douglas is the charismatic charmer who probably didn't have to . garner has long been one of the best actors around at playing the put-upon grouch , and it is a delight simply to see him in a leading role on the big screen again . the two are both perfectly matched and perfectly mis-matched ; there is something about their veteran interaction which makes the most mundane situations sing with comic confidence . there isn't much segal can do with the sentimental angle in the script , as the ex-presidents' encounter with an average american family leads them to ask the " duh " -inspiring question of whether politicians may be out of touch with their constituents . all these problems my fellow americans has , yet i laughed harder than i had any reason to expect . handed the sow's ear of a standard buddy-caper script , jack lemmon and james garner were able to turn it into a purse . . . perhaps not silk , but surprisingly smooth nonetheless . 
0	after seeing and admiring wesley snipes's work in the recent and preposterous film murder at 1600 , i viewed one of his earlier films , passenger 57 . when passenger 57 was released in 1992 , i carefully avoided it because its reviews were abysmal . today i see most films , promising or not , so i can review them . without this policy , i would have never seen private parts or liar liar , both of which i loved , so there is something to be said for the see-them-all principle . ) like murder at 1600 , passenger 57's script ( by dan gordon and david loughery ) takes an already questionable premise and contorts it beyond any hope of credibility . hopeless plots have only two successful strategies , either go for parody or cast a strong lead and hope the lead can carry the film . passenger 57 has exactly one jewel -- snipes . although snipes sometimes seems too smart for his character , his performance is always interesting , albeit not as good as in murder at 1600 . the plot , such as it is , surrounds the hijacking of a plane by terrorists . bruce payne , whose specialty seems to be playing in numerous obscure movies , plays the terrorist leader charles rane . payne relies on his ever shifting eyes to express emotion . his performance is the sort that elicits laughter at the wrong times . elizabeth hurley plays his side kick , sabrina ritchie . her acting relies on a silly collection of sneers . most of the cast plays the material dead seriously , except for ernie lively as chief biggs . lively did not get the message on the film's intent and goes for pure parody as the racist southern cop with an iq only slightly higher than his age . although somewhat out-of-place , he is just ridiculous enough to be funny . director kevin hooks , whose most recent film was fled , likes lots of guns and action to keep up the energy . passenger 57 provides brainless entertainment for couch potatoes , but little more . it is rated r for violence . the film would be fine for teenagers . although i enjoyed watching snipes , i cannot recommend the film and can only give the picture * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	screenplay : richard lagravenese . director : richard lagravenese . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , drug use , brief nudity ) running time : 93 minutes . no , it's not the plot for an episode of " ally mcbeal , " though it sure seems like it at times . writer and first-time director richard lagravenese sets up living out loud as a wistful comedy about adults reaching a point in their lives where they wonder if it's too late to make up for their bad decisions . at least initially , it appears that living out loud is going to balance the stories of its two main characters , and that's when the film is at its best . devito's performance may be his best screen work to date , finding the romanticism at the heart of pat's irresponsibility . playing a decent guy is one of an actor's toughest challenges , but devito makes pat a genuinely decent guy who's also an interesting guy . with queen latifah added to the mix as a singer with unique relationship issues , there's an earthy counter-point for hunter's nervous energy . the importance of that counter-point is only truly evident when it's gone . at 93 minutes , living out loud feels strangely incomplete , perhaps because pat vanishes into the background in the final half of the film and judith takes over completely . unfortunately , a little of judith goes a long way . while it's easy to sympathize with her situation , it's much harder to sympathize with her , because -- to put it bluntly -- she grows annoying to spend time with . holly hunter is a very talented actress , but here she acts with mannerisms instead of finding the character's emotional center . she plays judith like an alien investigating the world -- an interesting choice for a character in existential crisis , but one that underlines things rather than letting them unfold . in nearly every scene , you can see hunter's acting muscles bulging and flexing . living out loud still manages to be somewhat satisfying , largely thanks to devito and lagravenese . for a writer making his first venture into directing , lagravenese shows a solid cinematic sensibility , though he does also let the camera linger on people delivering dialogue . it's wonderful to find a writer actually writing for grown-ups , and some of his tart lines and absurdist fantasy situations are fun in bits and pieces , but ultimately living out loud is a frustrating experience . all that's missing is a computer-generated baby dancing to " hooked on a feeling .

2	does the world need another mob movie ? just the facts ma'am . the mob in this movie is neither glamorous nor particularly horrifying - just a bunch of working-class stiffs out to make a living . others , such as being " whacked , " certainly exceed the fear of being downsized . at least if you lose your job , in most firms death is not part of the severance package . director mike newell , whose recent work has been with such wonderful , lighthearted comedies as four weddings and a funeral , sets a factual tone from the beginning . the gangsters in this film are much more human and accessible characters . they perform terrible deeds certainly , but none are awarded the mythical and heroic status most such pictures bestow on hoodlums . just as actors get into character for a part and have trouble breaking out , so does joe . it's difficult keeping the family together if you can only see them sporadically . all of this notwithstanding , pistone was one of the most important fbi plants ever . pacino's lefty looks at first like a consummate professional crook . ( as you watch their antics , you realize that the moniker wiseguy has such great irony . " thirty years i'm busting my hump , " complains lefty . " what have i got ? " " who am i ? i'm a spoke on a wheel . " together pacino and depp turn in two fascinating performances with believable macho chemistry between the two of them . the story concentrates on relationships and political intrigues rather than violence . a well developed subplot deals with the difficulties of donnie's home life and tells this part of the story with a realism i have not seen before . you empathize with the wife and kids , and yet depp transfers the feeling of being trapped so that you can understand both sides . " i am them . " their inept therapist gives them lectures full of jargon that are so far off base that they border on parody . the script is highly polished . director mike newell's skill can be seen throughout . this can be seen in potentially the most horrific act of violence in the picture . newell shows just enough so that the actions are clear , but he does not let his cameras linger . the resulting image possesses a humorously macabre feeling . joe couldn't leave his work at the office like most of us . if you think you have seen it all when it comes to the mob , think again . even if you could care less about organized crime , donnie brasco is as interesting an exploration of the human spirit and failings as it is a story about crime and moral turpitude . it is rated r for violence , profanity , and sexuality . it would be fine for most teenagers . i highly recommend the film to you and give it * * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 102 minutes . somehow , there's something even more icky about an exploitative and routine horror film that tarts up its exploitation and routineness with plenty of style . such is the case with neil jordan's in dreams , a psychological thriller which lets its atmospheric creepiness disintegrate into a trite chase-n-terrorize puree . for a while , it looks like in dreams is going to be a thriller of a different stripe , something as dramatically and visually compelling as it is viscerally shocking . the story takes claire on a descent into genuine madness , the kind that makes a character truly unpredictable and interesting to watch . partly it seems rushed , with scenes slammed together too quickly to develop the necessary foreboding . and partly it seems mean-spirited , using graphic murders for shock value or imperiled children for sympathy value , rather than building interest in the characters . over its final 45 minutes , in dreams begins a slow but steady descent from potent psychological thriller to careless mess . to be fair to downey , the role is a serial killer cliche -- he's a norman bates momma's boy with _serious_ gender role issues -- without a remotely sympathetic quality , dashing hopes of a mind-game showdown into the rocks . instead it's all guns and sharp objects , running and screaming , until a bleak , unsatisfying and confounding resolution . it's a huge disappointment coming from neil jordan , a film-maker who has consistently made films that defied expectations -- the company of wolves , the crying game , the butcher boy . in a sad way , that's exactly what he does here . just when you expect in dreams might turn out to be a memorably disturbing horror film , it turns out to be a gutless , nihilistic tease . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
1	to make artistic films in a repressed country is very difficult , but to make documentaries for an amateur filmmaker can work simply because he is an amateur and is not expected to be after something politically dangerous , therefore he is thought of as less of a risk to those governments . kieslowski went from making documentaries to making this fictional film , and in some ways this film is semi-autobiographical , as it is about what power there is in the camera , especially for one who is an artist . philip is the central focus of the film , as he undergoes a transformation of personality . it seems that even though he didn't intend to , he hurts those who are not responsible for what he does . this is a political spoof on the artist's role and limits in communist poland and a comedy , as it comically exaggerates the film buff's growing pathology and voyeuristic tendencies . the power in the story was in the subtle reminders , showing that behind the obvious censorship , there is a real censorship problem for everyone , it is not only in the conflicts between the artist and the authorities-- but , for both the artist and the viewer who must demand that the truth and integrity of the work be preserved . poland is a good example of such a battlefield , with the then state-owned film industry in charge of funding projects , documentary films are sometimes the best records of such history , unless you have the artistic deftness , like kieslowski has shown , to make a film as wickedly ironical as this one is and get it past the censors . since the film's theme has been done many times before , and the comic efforts of the film were rather flat , what made this film provocative , was the absorbing performance by jerzy stuhr , who would become a regular in many of the director's later films , which spanned a career of over 20 years . and for showing that struggle through stuhr's eyes , the film is memorable , though it is not one of the director's top-flight artistic works , yet it is still worth seeing . 
0	cast : chris farley , matthew perry , eugene levy , kevin dunn , david packer , lisa barbuscia director : christopher guest producer : denise di novi screenplay : mark nutter & tom wolfe & boyd hale cinematography : adam kimmel , kenneth macmillan music : jeffrey c . j . vanston u . s . distributor : warner brothers several days after having seen this movie , i'm still trying to determine what director christopher guest , a man whose sense of humor i usually appreciate , found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes . this is a dreadful motion picture ? a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio . there's a kind of desperation in the movie's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is ; the manic style betrays itself as a last-ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script . this setup leads to a lot of shouting , a great deal of lunacy , and very few laughs . farley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing , but , aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle , his heart doesn't seem to be in it . as a foil for farley and an antidote to his runaway energy , perry lacks the necessary edge of the proverbial straight man . i'm not a big fan of david spade , and i didn't like tommy boy , but at least he and farley worked well together . as far as the supporting players go , none of them makes more than a fleeting impression . eugene levy is wasted , and kevin dunn is about as interesting here as he is in godzilla . frankly , it's a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly come from christopher guest , the brilliant comic force behind such films as this is spinal tap , the big picture , and waiting for guffman . although guest gets the costumes right , this nearly-inconsequential success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution . the special effects , such as they are , are execrable . for an example of some really poor blue screen work , look at the scenes where the characters are shooting the rapids ( they're obviously getting buckets of water thrown on them ) and where farley is being carried off by an eagle . even though farley didn't have the most stellar of acting careers , he doesn't deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by almost heroes . while some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a few guffaws from 12-year old boys , the level of comedy in almost heroes falls far below the level of sophomoric . farley fans who see this film as a way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty , since it takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this cinematic torture session .

1	it is a movie populated with sweet , non-offensive characters . it is told as if it were a true story and yet the tone of the film is that of an aesop fable . it is the sort of show that will undoubtedly work its charm on many of you . although the movie is billed as the latest hugh grant flick , it is an ensemble cast . the movie is about the fix . the story is predictable which is probably okay since it is a fable and not a mystery . the characters are all played with great and consistent gusto by all of the cast . all she needs do is give her infectious smile at the right time and the screen lights up . hugh grant ( so wonderful in four weddings and a funeral and sirens among others ) gave a nice performance , but not his best . it is his goal and the script he wrote that was my problem with the picture . for me the characters , while cute , were not credible enough to be believable nor humorous enough to be funny . to me it was an attempt at droll humor that failed . i almost felt guilty about not caring more for a sweet little movie with carefully drawn characters , effective cinematography ( vernon layton ) , and dramatic music ( stephen endelman ) . i found the slow pacing by the editor ( david martin ) and the low key tone of the dialog boring and even sleep inducing at points . the englishman who went up a hill , but came down a mountain runs fairly short at 1 : 38 , but it felt much longer . it is a g show that tried and succeeded in getting its more marketable pg rating by throwing in a few mild cuss words . no one would be harmed by seeing this show , but i can not see how it would appeal to kids under 8 . i award the movie * * for good acting , but give it a mild thumbs down as it just did not work for me . i have trouble with shows with elevated saccharine levels . you may fall in love with this movie if you have a higher tolerance . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : may 19 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	sometimes there is no better demonstration of a concept poorly executed than the same concept well executed . take tumbleweeds , for instance . sound familiar ? it should -- the plot is virtually identical to that of the current susan sarandon/natalie portman film anywhere but here . tumbleweeds just happens to be a rich character study that feels genuinely human , instead of like a hollywood construct . it doesn't start out looking that way . the wacky set pieces smack of contrivance , turning tumbleweeds into a low-budget variation on mainstream tales of female bonding . even the hand-held camera work starts to seem more like a contrivance than a tool to evoke a sense of urgency the very grittiness o'connor is aiming for becomes just another brand of glossiness . newcomer kimberly j . brown's performance as ava , which had seemed too rough around the edges , develops into something intriguing and unique , not at all the typical mature-beyond-her-years , foul-mouthed-beyond-prime-time movie kid . janet mcteer's brassy mary jo similarly blossoms into a character easy to understand but considerably harder to pin down . the relationship between the two shows all the twists , turns and knots of a complex mother/daughter pairing , but there's never a sense of manufactured conflict . these people behave like real people ; their battles don't sound scripted , and their interdependent affection is thoroughly convincing . brown and mcteer are both pretty darned good , but the reason tumbleweeds starts to work so well is that o'connor doesn't force the story to rest entirely on their shoulders . tumbleweeds gives its two central characters a context in which to operate , something sadly lacking in anywhere but here . verisimilitude isn't necessary for every kind of film , but it's fairly useful in a character study . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
0	director : john mctiernan . mpaa rating : r ( violence , gore , adult themes ) running time : 104 minutes . from the department of token praise : give john mctiernan and michael crichton some credit for an action film in which the hero is an arab . all right , so the arab hero is played by a spaniard -- hollywood needs to crawl before it can stagger in a remotely straight line . the problem with the 13th warrior isn't its multicultural sensitivity , but the unlikely context in which that subtext is placed . at its core , the film is the kind of swords-and-shields romp little seen since the early '80s heyday of schwarzenegger as conan the barbarian and singer as the beastmaster . that the bonding occurs between rambunctious polytheistic nordic guys and a devout muslim gives the narrative a funky anachronistic flavor -- " dungeons and dragons " for the " why can't we all just get along " '90s . there's nothing automatically off-putting about watching men exchanging prayers in the first millennium -- it's not as though the 20th century introduced the concept of tolerance . it just happens to be the most obvious example of the 13th warrior's insistence on attending to subplots and subtext when it hasn't provided the basic framework for an adventure . ibn fahdlan's norse comrades are so interchangeable and lacking in personality that the press notes identify them both by name and by some trait that might jog the memory -- " helfdane ( fat ) , " " ragnar ( dour ) , " and so on . the wendol remain shadowy and indistinct , never developing into truly threatening villains despite the gasps that accompany the mention of their name . meanwhile , there's time spent on a blink-and-you'll-miss-it romantic interlude for ibn fahdlan , and a bit of norse political intrigue which exists largely to provide one character a chance to scowl and flip his fur cloak dramatically every time he appears on screen . thank heavens for the occasional anarchic battle scene to remind us that this is in fact an adventure film . those battle scenes certainly serve their visceral purpose , perhaps enough so to please the blood 'n' guts crowd . it's just that the whole mess is often too busy to get down to business . on the one hand , it's sort of a nice touch , emphasizing the culture clash with which ibn fahdlan must contend ; on the other hand , it makes the scene such a jumble of cuts and translations that it grows dizzying . mctiernan has toyed with a pseudo-profound action film , and wound up with only a pseudo-action film , another noble effort to file in the department of token praise . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	after i'd seen this movie , someone asked me who the good guys were . i had a hard time answering , and that points out one of geronimo's fundamental flaws . for the most part , its characterizations are so weak and ambivalent that the audience finds it difficult to develop much feeling for any of the people we encounter on screen , regardless of whether they're white or native american . this is a beautifully-photographed motion picture , although cinematographer lloyd ahern has a tendency to overuse red and amber filters . if nothing else , geronimo at least has the look of an epic . wes studi , the cherokee actor who gave such an impassioned portrayal of magua in last year's the last of the mohicans , is more subdued as geronimo . gatewood is supposed to be torn by duty to his country and sympathy with a people his government is about to betray , but patric does such a poor job of bringing to the fore anything but surface emotions that we lose all interest in his character and , as a result , the film loses much of its appeal . gene hackman and robert duvall don't give their best performances here , but they're entirely believable , and they elevate the film a level during their scenes . in a more interesting role , duvall is al sieber , an apache hunter who admits to a grudging respect for his arch rival geronimo . although patric's flat performance doesn't help matters , it's the confused and boring script that ultimately proves to be geronimo's undoing . the battle scenes are wonderful , but much of the exposition between them is tedious in the extreme . also , the movie doesn't seem to know which side to sympathize with . instead of that indecision leading to a gritty result , it creates ambivalence and apathy . geronimo is not a bad movie , but neither does it live up to its promise . the legend itself may be fascinating , but this treatment doesn't have the life necessary to be of more than passing interest . those expecting another dances with wolves had better look elsewhere . 
1	this worked , making for a crafty production , mainly because it left much of the horror scenes to the viewer's imagination . hammer studio also exploited the x rating it received , which meant only those over 18 could attend , as it launched a massive ad campaign which brought in the crowds to find out why such a rating and also by making the x part of the film's title--the quatermass xperiment , it kept the public's attention on its ad campaign . yet the monster remains a sympathetic figure . it was an easy film to watch , as it had its creative moments in the dark . it offered better entertainment value than most big-budget sci-fi films . 
1	it is even suggested that c ? sar isn't disfigured at all . perhaps , he's told , he's like those anorexic teenage girls who just think they're fat . welcome to the escher world of writer and director alejandro amen ? bar's open your eyes ( abre los ojos ) , a movie that delights in playing tricks with our minds . dreams within dreams within dreams are some of its more straightforward stratagems . as a purposely-confusing mind game of what's real and what's a mirage , the story has an undeniable attraction . like trying to finish the sunday crossword puzzle before your spouse , you're likely to stay glued to the screen . but when it's over , you won't have much more to take away than the puzzle's solution . the characters act like disconnected figures in a video game . the latter character should have been eliminated entirely . with its richly textured music and its striking cinematography , the movie is a feast for the ears and eyes . as the story drags and turns increasingly bizarre , its handsome production makes up for many of its shortfalls . never a bad movie , it's more of a near miss , unlike the other recent spanish film , the lovers of the arctic circle , which is nearly perfect . both films play games with reality and time sequences . c ? sar's experiences are just " one of those candid camera jokes , " antonio suggests . perhaps . when they finally reveal the big secret in the end , you're liable to just shake your head -- both because it's so ludicrous and because you can easily and correctly write the epilogue . the latter is so obvious as to be trite . open your eyes runs too long at 1 : 50 . the film is in rapid fire spanish with english subtitles . it is rated r for sex , nudity , profanity and violence and would be fine for older teenagers . 
1	spain's prolific and visually audacious writer/director carlos saura ( tango ) is back this time with a film , goya in bordeaux , about the famous painter francisco de goya , played by the even more prolific spanish actor francisco rabal ( tie me up ! tie me down ! ) . the picture won several appropriately named " goyas , " the spanish equivalent of the oscars , for best actor , cinematography , set design and make-up . shot entirely on a sound stage , the surreal film opens with the image of a gutted beef carcass , being hauled up to dry . as the camera pulls in tight on the bloody flesh , the editor dissolves the frame into one of goya's face . listening to these ramblings of an old man is rather like trying to assemble a puzzle in which you've lost most of the pieces . much more than that isn't clear . to evaluate goya in bordeaux on the storyline and dialog , however , misses the point of the film . saura is a visual stylist and his works have to be evaluated on that level . think of this as a cinematic opera , and you'll get the idea . for this reason , whenever roque ba ? os's wonderful period music plays and the actors shut up , the movie soars . the corollary to this , however , is that when the film , as it frequently does , sticks to traditional dialog sans music , it quickly grinds to a halt . but pump up the sound , turn on the fog machine and let those actors stroll by in lavish costumes , powdery wigs and make-up , and you have grand opera for just the price of a movie ticket . the film is in spanish with english subtitles . it is rated r for some sexuality and violent imagery and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
2	cast : thomas kretschmann , dominique horwitz , jochen nickel , sebastian rudolph , dana vavrova director : joseph vilsmaier producers : hanno huth , guenter rohrbach , and joseph vilsmaier screenplay : juergen buescher , johannes m . m . it's so easy -- too easy , in fact -- for a war movie to turn into a celebration of blood , death , and mayhem . occasionally , however , a rare and powerful war movie reaches the screen -- one that delivers a visceral anti- violence message with the force of a punch to the gut . stalingrad , a 1993 german/swedish co-production from guenter rohrbach , the producer of das boot , is such a picture . in the tradition of apocalypse now , platoon , and a midnight clear , it uses graphic violence to condemn war . by the end , it no longer matters whether they live or die -- in almost every way , they're already gone . the psychologically destructive power of war is most clearly illustrated through the changes undergone by hans . there isolated moments of human triumph in stalingrad -- like a russian and german exchanging bread for meat , and hans setting a woman free instead of raping her . but these are exceptions . stalingrad's disturbing power comes through its portrayal of the horrific -- decapitations , amputations , grizzly deaths , and mutilations . nothing is gratuitous ; everything is effective . stalingrad is packed with tension , and the battle sequences are startlingly realistic , but it's the inescapable message that lingers . 
2	kristin scott thomas's narration occupies only about ninety seconds of the dazzling documentary microcosmos , which made it even easier to hear every comment in an audience composed largely of families with young children . ordinarily , the prospect of an afternoon spent with a crowd of garrulous youngsters might send me screaming for an iv drip of valium , but the 75 minutes i spent in microcosmos may have been the most uplifting 75 minutes i've spent in a theater in years . here were 9- and 10-year-olds asking questions about insects , enraptured by the natural world , chattering excitedly in the lobby afterwards about their favorite scenes . it was one of those rare occasions when a film left me a bit more optimistic about our collective future as inquisitive beings . it is a simple enough concept ( though the process was anything but simple ) , but what makes microcosmos so consistently enthralling is the ability of nuridsany and perennou to find stories in their tiny subjects , stories which give them a personality . mating is not shown in clinical detail with a dry narrative description -- instead , two snails meet , caress and embrace in a strangely beautiful moment set to a soaring aria . in perhaps the film's most memorable sequence , a sacred scarab beetle rolls a small ball of dung until he is halted by a briar jutting out of the ground . the ability of that sequence to turn a beetle into a hero demonstrates that nuridsany and perennou have a talent most feature film-makers only dream about . most of us have seen nature footage of birds or amphibians which made the insects the insects upon which they snacked insignificant bit players in the food chain . microcosmos is like a novel based on another novel's supporting characters , turning sub-plots into life stories . one exceptional shot captures the bird's eye through the entrance to the ants' tunnels like an ogre peeping through a keyhole at his prey ; another represents the bird as a monstrous shadow . the film-makers want to show you parts of our world you may have taken for granted , and to show you in a way which grabs you as a narrative as much as an entomology lesson . in fact , the only time microcosmos sags is when it does resemble conventional nature footage . it is interesting watching a spider speed-wrap a grasshopper caught in its web , but it is a purely intellectual interest ; the same is true of a spider which constructs a kind of underwater diving bell for itself . these are moments which might make you go " hmmm , " but they don't fascinate you like a battle between stag beetles which seems to personalize the combatants . yet one of the best moments in the stag beetle sequence is a seemingly throwaway scene of another , smaller insect being tossed to the ground during the titanic struggle like a nameless patron in a western bar room brawl . it seems that even within this world there are supporting characters , and the wonderful thing about microcosmos is that you find yourself waiting for nuridsany and perennou to follow the unfortunate fellow on his own adventure , to the delight of children and adults alike . 
2	sound familiar ? of course , it's a coincidence that switchback , which uses this critical plot device , is opening in the wake of a mammoth late-october snow storm that crippled the american midwest , but it's great timing . paramount pictures couldn't have come up with a better release date if they'd planned it . these are the diverse strands that screenwriter jeb stuart weaves together into the tapestry of switchback , his taut , intelligent directorial debut . unlike most thrillers , switchback doesn't move at a breakneck pace that camouflages flaws by ceaseless action and non-stop edge-of-the-seat moments . by the time the final reel unspools , we've spent time with each of these men and have come to understand a measure of what makes them tick . that's not to say that there's no tension in switchback . stuart , who wrote the fugitive and is helming a motion picture for the first time , crafts the movie in a fashion that builds tautness gradually . ice , snow , mountainous heights , and racing trains all contribute to switchback's growing sense of unease , which culminates in an ending that , sadly , is all-too- routine . but , while the finale is anticlimactic ( and even a little silly ) , it's easily the weakest aspect of an otherwise well-realized narrative . while switchback doesn't boast any " a-line " stars , all of the roles are well-cast and each of the performers does a laudable job . danny glover ( last seen floundering in gone fishin' ) , one of hollywood's most likable actors , plays the kind of helpful , cheerful character that he is often associated with . jared leto ( prefontaine ) adds the right note of ambiguity to lane to make us uncertain about his sincerity and intentions . but , as good as these three are , the scene-stealer is r . lee ermey ( prefontaine ) , whose sheriff buck olmstead takes over the screen as one of the year's most memorable supporting characters . ermey's performance as the moral , practical , cynical law man is nothing short of superb . switchback avoids many of the staple aspects of serial killer movies . first and foremost , this is not a whodunit . while i have gone to great pains not to reveal the killer's identity in this review , it's not much of a secret . there are enough clues littered around that it's possible to finger him twenty minutes into the film , and the truth is explicitly revealed before the halfway point . secondly , stuart successfully avoids turning the picture into a routine chase . in fact , for much of the movie , it's not clear exactly how everything is going to fit together in the end . aside from the obligatory nature of the ending , if there's one complaint i have about switchback , it's that there are times when the characters seem too smart -- but that's infinitely better than the alternative . like the game and kiss the girls , switchback features an elaborately-structured contest between the hero and the villain . of these three movies , this one is the best , because it takes the time to develop its characters and doesn't force-feed us increasingly difficult- to-swallow plot twists . as the title implies , the storyline for switchback does feature a few unexpected curves , but it doesn't try to dazzle us with narrative contortions . in the end , the film is almost more disturbing than it is exhausting , but you'll leave the theater with a sense of grim satisfaction . for switchback , jeb stuart can be credited with a job well done . " for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake . " 
0	the pelican brief has a lot in common with this summer's the firm . both were directed by " prestige " directors , and both were constructed from the " slicker is better " model of thriller-making . in short , the pelican brief might as well * be * the firm : an overlong , over-plotted , instantly forgettable entertainment sporadically enlivened by decent supporting performances . unfortunately , it doesn't have gene hackman . technically , the pelican brief is just fine . james horner's score works well , even if it does depend overmuch on dissonant piano chords and wood block percussion . the problem with the pelican brief , the movie , is the same thing that's wrong with the pelican brief , the book : there's not a single interesting or original thing happening , either from a story or character perspective . the big conspiracy at the heart of the story is both insipid and insulting to one's intelligence . it's impossible to accept that no one considered the possibility of spacing out the assassinations , or being slightly more creative than putting a bullet in the head of a man who was on a respirator . there's only one possible reason for such stupidity : there wouldn't have been anything for a clever law student to sniff out . grisham's story is loaded with implausibilities and the payoff it offers for accepting them is simply not worth it . the characters in pakula's adaptation don't fare much better . there is not a shred of back story , nothing to suggest why she pursues the assassination story , nothing to make her anything but a positively bland lady in distress . to her credit , roberts' reaction to an explosion is gripping , and she's thoroughly convincing at suggesting dazed trauma , but dazed and traumatized is about as fara as this role goes . denzel washington , one of the most talented and charismatic leading men around , has an equally blank slate with gray grantham ; somehow he manages to act circles around a part where there's really nothing there . only hume cronyn , in a single scene as the aging justice rosenberg , has any spark . no one else has a thing to work with . the firm was no piece of art , but at least its characters were reasonably fleshed out for the screen . the pelican brief asked me to sit through nearly two and a half hours of repetitive chases involving people i didn't care about . a third grisham adaptation , the client , is on its way next year . i suppose it's too much to ask that he's learned to write an interesting story by now . 
2	this is one of those movies that if it were not true , you would see it and complain about how the screenwriter , director , and lead actress had all stretched believability beyond all reasonable bounds . yet , this is supposedly a very accurate portrayal of the events , and i believe it . you are going to be very surprised about the sequence of events in the show . i did not guess many of the twists and turns . suffice it to say you may think that the writer's name was franz kafka where as the writer and director was ken loach . her performance is so outstanding that both siskel and ebert wanted her to get an academy award nomination for it , and i agree . she plays maggie as the unlikable and tormented character that she is . rock is shaped like the rock of gibraltar and is about as good looking . this seemed like perfect casting to me . maggie is so angry to everyone you find yourself amazed that she has any friends left at all , much less a long succession of lovers . i do not know if the show is ultimately about abuse , anger , or morality--perhaps all three equally . the movie runs about right at 1 : 42 . it is unrated , but would be a hard r for scary , explicit , and bloody domestic violence scenes plus zillions of uses of the f-word . i recommend this show , but only for adults . it is a depressing but enlightening show . i give it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : february 2 , 1995 opinions expressed are solely mine & not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	" and i say this with all due respect . i have to admit , you're a babe . " leave it to beaver's june cleaver , as played with grace and delicate wit by janine turner , is a knockout . " you know what that does to me . " ) next to the surprise that the remake of the 1950's tv series is reasonably charming , the biggest surprise is that the parents -- christopher mcdonald plays a sincere ward cleaver -- steal the show . even the twelve-year-olds are interesting , but poor eight-year-old beaver cleaver , played by the numbers by cameron finley , is stuck with the least imaginative part of all . ( osmond as well as the original june , barbara billingsley , appear in brief cameo roles in the remake . the new june is much better , but don't be surprised if you pine for the old , more nefarious eddie . ) erik von detten's wally is more laid back than the original and more interested in the opposite sex . when wally spins the bottle during that quintessential adolescent ritual of old , the result is as touching as it is predictable . although the script by brian levant and lon diamond has some of the obligatory , campy scenes , for the bulk of the film the addition of a laugh track would be impossible . unlike the series , which was strictly comedy , the movie has a gentler and more serious tone . randy edelman's sweeping music has the drama of a much more substantial endeavor . combined with thomas del ruth's warm backlit cinematography and perry andelin blake's colorfully nostalgic sets , the picture beckons us to enter and enjoy even if the story gets pretty thin . " hamlet " it isn't . " if i grow up and have as dumb a kid as me , " decides beaver . " it'd be hard not to want to belt him . " the film itself succeeds in spite of , not because of , beaver's laughable stupidity . director andy cadiff has the good sense to focus on the rest of the family . it is rated pg for a couple of instances of bathroom humor . the film would be fine for any age , and i suspect that the baby-boomer parents may like it better than their kids , who are the putative audience for the picture . my son jeffrey , age 8 , thought the film was " really good " and commented that it might make his top 20 of the year list . i recommend this small pleasure to your family and give it * * 1/2 . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	it's a routine revenge western but , nevertheless , has elements of the quirkiness peckinpah's films will later on become reknown for . this film is visually powerful in spots , as it overcomes its routine theme with burning images of lust , greed , and hatred . maureen sings the film's theme song during the opening and closing credits . 
2	katherine forgives him , and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have . to lang's credit , even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference , it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook . his portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised . 
0	baise-moi ( rape me ) , which has the dubious distinction of being literally banned in france , could be a strikingly effective public service announcement against the dangers of casual sex if it weren't for the fact that manu and nadine like to murder strangers , male and female , indiscriminately even if no sex whatsoever is involved . the reactions to the film are likely to be as widely varied as at our screening in which one guy laughed constantly , apparently seeing the film as a humorous thelma & louise do porn , and another woman remarked to me afterwards that a film like this could ruin sex for you forever . a hyperviolent film which features real , not simulated , sex , it does have its erotic moments , the shocking rape scene not being one of them . " where are the witty lines ? " amen . the film is in french with english subtitles . it is not rated but would be nc-17 for graphic , real sex , graphic violence , drug usage and language . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
1	moretti can best be thought of as an italian woody allen . where the two directors differ is that moretti seems so constantly and incurably happy that it is hard to take his complaints seriously . i was astonished to find the class just as full on the second day . as the students told me later , they didn't believe me because i was too nice . so it is with moretti , which takes much of the sting out of his caustic comedy . ) some of the film's most endearing images are those of moretti with his infant son . as the baby wails , moretti doesn't know what to do . what he can do , moretti figures , is promise material goods . " i'll buy you a scooter the moment you turn 14 . " among the many scenes that don't work is one involving a bowl of pasta that doesn't appear hot . one of moretti's assistants on the documentary tries to blow cigarette smoke over the pasta , but it looks fake . much of the movie's humor comes across as cold as the pasta . part of the film's humor surrounds moretti's insecurity . he is even more concerned that he doesn't have anything to say in the first place . as the frustrated moretti films his documentary , his mind strays to the film he really wants to be making instead -- a colorful musical set in the 1950s about a trotskyite chef . at the end of aprile , we get to watch a little bit of this fun little farce being filmed . this is the movie that i wish he had made rather than aprile . although aprile may find resonance among italians , much of its humor went past this american . it may be that understanding the nuances of the italian political parties would have helped . or perhaps moretti is simply an acquired taste . the movie is in italian with english subtitles . it is not rated but might be pg-13 for some language and one brief scene of pot smoking and would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up . 
2	cast away , which brings together forrest gump's team of star tom hanks and director robert zemeckis , is nothing less than the best movie of the year . and with tremendous poignancy and honesty , tom hanks delivers the best performance of the year . a harrowing and deeply moving story , it is the scariest movie in years , not in a manipulative or artificial way but with incidents of genuine beauty and terror . when you're not on the edge of your seat , you'll be jumping off of it . but it is a rewarding film , not some cheap thrill , that makes you rethink what's important in life as well as how hard basic survival can be . hunt , who seems to be in every recent film , is an actress of whom you can never get enough . the role could easily have been a throwaway since this is essentially a one man picture . well , there is also a volleyball , but more on that later . i've been in an airplane that went into freefall , and there is no more frightening experience . our plane pulled out in time , but chuck's didn't . the airline disaster is the first of many times that you'll be gripping yourself , your armrest , your companion or all three . don't be surprised if you scream . this , however , is far from the last such experience that you will have while watching cast away . self-administered dentistry and simple injuries will be others . even zemeckis's recent what lies beneath isn't nearly as frightening as cast away because the former film was just a movie whereas cast away plays more like real life . foraging for food and trying to create a fire prove much harder than you might suspect . if you've foolishly harbored any doubts whatsoever about hanks's acting ability , this movie will remove them . while we are on the island , zemeckis lets no background music spoil the feeling of being alone in nature . a serious movie , it does provide some comedic flourishes to make it less difficult to watch . but to the writer's credit , he manages to make the end almost as gripping and successful as the rest of the picture . only in the unnecessary proclivity to too neatly tie up loose ends in the last scene or two does the movie ever fail us . if they ever release a five hour director's cut of the movie , i'm there . it's that kind of story . it could not be more absorbing . we'd love to know more . cast away runs 2 : 23 but feels shorter . it is rated pg-13 for intense action sequences and some disturbing images . it would be acceptable for teenagers , but the movie is likely to frighten most viewers regardless of age . 
1	take a deep breath and prepare to suspend your disbelief , because in bringing us this summer's first ( and probably only ) pure action film , jean-claude van damme and john woo have given new meaning to the word " preposterous . " hard target is , in essence , an example of the victory of style over substance . when it comes to the " typical " criteria by which a film is judged , this movie fails badly . its characters are poorly-developed , the plot is the pinnacle of absurdity , and the acting , at best , is well over-the-top . nevertheless , on the most basic , visceral level , the film succeeds . those who went to last action hero and left disappointed because they expected a straight action film , will likely accord redemption to the summer of '93 because of hard target . albeit with a thinner plot , this is the kind of no-holds-barred chase , fight , and shoot-out picture that has become a schwarzenegger staple . van damme has an accent , the charisma , the physique , and the lack of acting skills . really , unless you're paying the check , it's hard to tell the difference . indeed , he doesn't merely direct this movie , he choreographs it , turning simple fight sequences into ballets of bloodshed . it's compelling , albeit a little disconcerting , to see violence so lovingly and carefully photographed . hard target isn't some hack job--a lot of effort went into crafting the picture . snipped and put back together to avoid an nc-17 , the film still offers a lot of mayhem and murder . it would have been interesting to see the cut that represented woo's initial vision . there is perhaps a little too much slow-motion photography , and the score , while capturing the flavor of louisiana , often becomes intrusive . early in the film , it seems that every time we're treated to a shot of van damme , he's walking towards us in slow-motion with his overcoat flapping in the breeze while an unnecessary blast of music blares from the theater speakers . the first half of the film occasionally slows up for some silly exposition , but by the mid-point , the hunt is underway , and it's all action from there . if , by five minutes into the movie , you haven't put your brain into park , this is going to seem like an utterly ridiculous effort . those who are willing to get into the spirit are in for a roller-coaster ride directed by a master and acted by someone who knows how to kick higher than most people can jump . i'm not going to say much about the plot , because it's far too contrived to be worth mentioning . suffice it to say that if the success of hard target depended on it , the movie would be sunk . even for the action-oriented film-goer , there are a few moments too hard to swallow ( where's the " s " on van damme's chest ? ) . if nothing else , they're good for comic relief which , fortunately ( or should i say " hopefully " ) seems to be woo's intent . he's fun to watch , but he goes so far over-the-top that i'm not sure it would be justified to call what he does a " performance " . regardless , he provides an excellent and much-needed counterpoint to van damme's ho-hum delivery . the hero , after all , is good with his kicks and punches , but not his lines . yancy butler does a poor job , even considering the company she keeps . someone who can make van damme look like a drama school graduate really needs to take some acting lessons ( although , admittedly , there's a scene with a snake where she's fantastic ) . and couldn't they have gotten someone a little more lively than wilford brimley for chance's lunatic uncle ? anyway , you pretty much get the idea . without the elegant technique of john woo , hard target could have been a real dud . it is not a good alternative to more intelligent thrillers such as in the line of fire and the fugitive , but that's not the market it's aimed at . however , those that enter a darkened theater showing this film with a reasonable idea of what they're getting themselves into , are likely to emerge satisfied . 
2	it's a terrible habit of mine that i often find myself watching non-english language films throught he lens of " how would hollywood screw this up . " aside from the implied inherent superiority of all things sub-titled , there's the strange problem of comparing a film i'm watching to a film that hasn't even been made , but which in my head is a dire experience indeed . a film can't help but seem glorious under such conditions , though it doesn't help the discussion of the film on its own merits . i was doing a pretty good job of avoiding the hypothetical comparison in zhang yimou's not one less , until a curious thing happened : in its final fifteen minutes , it started to turn into its own hollywood incarnation . thank heaven it's so good for so long that the strange twist can't spoil the experience . the impressive thing about both zhang's direction and shi xiangsheng's script ( based on his account of his experience as a rural teacher ) is how gradually and unobtrusively wei's character develops . she's pretty unsympathetic at the outset -- utterly unqualified for her post , effective primarily at playing goalkeeper at the schoolroom door , but not at all troubled about demanding her money . the cleverly handled scenes of wei leading the class in math problems with very real-world implications make for a solid foundation , but it's only when wei heads into the city that her quest becomes more selfless . wei's quest and the growing she does along the way make for a thoroughly compelling narrative , but zhang has socio-political fish to fry as well . it's still a satisfying resolution , but it's excessively underlined . it's the way hollywood films too often try to convince an audience they've not just watched an enjoyable film , but also become more compassionate , better-informed citizens of the world . the frustrating part is that it's so unnecessary . virtually from the outset , the financial conditions of the school become an effective part of the drama ; you'd never expect a film to wring such tension from a student stepping on the school's more-precious-than-gold chalk supply . the rookie actors are raw , but do a more than serviceable job of performing their own lives . in short , not one less does everything a film needs to do to draw you into its world , and into the characters inhabiting that world . when it resorts to a message-heavy happy ending , it suddenly feels like another sort of film entirely . for a thankfully brief moment , i saw a glimpse of the mass-market crowd-pleaser that might have been . it's a reminder of how much more pleasing a film can be when it sticks to simpler truths . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
2	screenplay : nicole holofcener . director : nicole holofcener . walking and talking is the kind of film men generally see only if dragged by their wives or girlfriends . they react much the same way a male character in walking and talking does when he refers to the acoustic guitar tunes preferred by his fiancee as " vagina music ; " by that definition , this would certainly be a " vagina film . " with recent flops like now and then and moonlight and valentino giving films about female friendships a rather bad name , it might be easy to dismiss walking and talking sight unseen . but for what it's worth , writer/director nicole holofcener puts a woody allen spin on the genre , making her debut feature a quirky neurotic comedy in which appealing performances help counteract a lack of substance . walking and talking seems to have two major themes working at the same time . on the one hand , it is about the romantic relationship of our two heroines , and it provides some clever and amusing insights . holofcener makes her characters sexual beings without having it be part of the joke that a woman is a sexual being , the way it happens in many films written by men , and there is an impressive ease to the way in which she portrays men and women who are comfortable with each other . one such scene finds laura and frank beginning a casual shoving match in an elevator which turns into a playful war , and it is typical of the economy with which holofcener establishes the dynamics of her characters' relationships . there are plenty of signifiers which show us how significant this friendship is -- an opening scene of laura and amelia as pre-teens reading " the joy of sex , " the illness of the cat they shared when they were roommates -- but the signifiers don't take the place of effective scenes between them . it is true that the problem between the two is that they don't spend much time together any more , but we don't get enough opportunities to see their friendship at its best so that we can feel a sense of loss over their friendship at its worst . walking and talking is not exactly meaty fare in either of its two main themes , but what sells the film is its frisky tone and a cast which downplays the angst . catherine keener ( who was the insecure ingenue in living in oblivion ) is a delight as amelia , and keeps her borderline obsessiveness from becoming either pathetic or disturbing . it's a funny and sad performance as a woman having difficulty differentiating between needing and needy . keener has an ability to connect with other actors , to really seem to be listening , and that makes for some priceless interactions . anne heche is a weaker link in a weaker role ; her laura's predicaments never seem as urgent to her or to us . nicole holofcener's script might be a bit talky , but the talk is sharp and the talkers even sharper . forget labels like " chick film . " 
2	gramercy hospital's emergency room is a picture of overcrowded chaos . it's moral questions like these that lift extreme measures above the level of a routine , paranoia-driven thriller like the net . true , when you get right down to it , this movie is about a guy trying simultaneously to survive , clear his name , and bring the bad guys down , but there are more shades of gray here than in most modern-day hitchcockian efforts . extreme measures never portrays guilt as clear- cut , and its easy to see how , by telling the same story with a script slanted towards another character's perspective , the roles of protagonist and antagonist could be reversed . his goal is to be known as the man who enabled the lame to walk -- a very godlike ambition . the question that luthan eventually has to confront is whether the ends do indeed justify the means . the resolution is perhaps not as powerful or satisfying as we might hope , but it's not a cop-out , either . considering its overall format , extreme measures employs the familiar rhythms that have fueled dozens of hitchcock-inspired thrillers ( including the fugitive ) . there's at least one betrayal . director michael apted , perhaps best known for his 7-up documentaries , has fashioned a well-paced features , keeping the tension level high even during routine action sequences ( of which there are perhaps a few too many ) . he has a keen sense of atmosphere , and the underground sequences are especially creepy and claustrophobic . in fact , extreme measures is a surprisingly dark film . even the humor is of the gallows variety . so how does hugh grant , the " aw shucks " poster boy of feel-good movies , fare in a role that is significantly different from anything he has recently attempted ? for the most part , he's solid . we come to identify with luthan , which is really all that's necessary for extreme measures to succeed . gene hackman is , as always , excellent , and it's in large part due to his performance that the film's central moral dilemma has teeth . sarah jessica parker , another actor better known for playing light , undemanding characters , is fine in a supporting role . extreme measures isn't going to be described as the " slam bang thrill ride " of the autumn , or any other such nonsense . the film's inherent tension comes not from the shootouts and chases , but from its core ethical questions -- questions that ultimately have to be addressed , not only in movies , but in real life . obviously , there's no easy answer , and , whether you agree or disagree with the position taken by extreme measures , at least the film frames its response in an entertaining , and occasionally thought-provoking , package . 
1	in 1991 , disney developed that idea into a movie called the rocketeer . a happy-go-lucky time , full of lavish nightclubs and barnstorming aviators . marilyn vance-straker's costumes for cliff are a delightful reinterpretation of those worn by buck rogers . the sets by james d . bissell capture a glamour that probably never existed except in our minds . james horner's music stays energetic and sugary sweet . one gets the sense that all of the cast and crew viewed the film as a romp . in good buck rogers fashion , which is the series the show most closely resembles , logic goes out the window . anyone wearing the rocket would have a barbecued rear and legs . the illogical aspects are not germane since the story stays totally in fantasyland . the problem with the film is that it is nothing more than an exercise in whimsical style . nothing in the narrative is compelling . in place of a story we have antics . cliff goes through all of the canonical gags including shooting out-of-control through a clothesline of freshly washed clothes . one gets tired of recycled comedy . still the scenes of soaring with the rocket are great fun , and they are fresh . well , fresh if you are too old to remember early science fiction movies . the biggest failing of the film is the casting of the lead . it is easy to see why bill campbell has never been given an important movie role before or since . campbell has no personality so his acting detracts from instead of enhancing cliff's persona . arkin , dalton , and connelly give nice performances , but all have done much better work . director joe johnson seems happy to let the actors in the film drift just so long as the atmosphere stays completely nostalgic . exercises in style like this are rarely enough for adults , although they can be enough to satisfy younger viewers . but not too young since tommy guns blast everywhere , and scores of people die in the film . nevertheless , the picture keeps its violence mainly at the cartoon level . and the acting too . it is rated pg although given the level of violence , pg-13 might have been more appropriate . the film should be fine for most kids say 7 or 8 and up , but be careful if they are sensitive to violence . my son jeffrey , age 8 , thought the movie was " good . " there is not enough for me to be able to recommend the movie . i give it * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : june 2 , 1997 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	producers : bernd eichinger and martin moskowicz . director : bille august . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , sexual situations ) running time : 119 minutes . before smilla's sense of snow , the last time director bille august gut hold of a mysterious , best-selling novel was 1994's the house of the spirits . if that thought doesn't send a shudder of dread through you at the prospects for smilla , you were probably fortunate enough to miss the house of the spirits . spirits was a disastrous combination of mis-guided casting and even more mis-guided story-telling , and it lost all sense of isabel allende's magical realism . peter hoeg's _froken smillas fornemmelse for sne_ ( miss smillas' feeling for snow ) presented a similarly challenging combination of atmosphere , character and plot , and august , but this time around he has been much more faithful to the source material . unfortunately , the result still isn't a particularly good film . as tense and evocative as smilla's sense of snow is during its first hour , it shares the fundamental flaw of the novel : a strange plot device which may leave you wondering if you've just seen " the x-files " movie . you'd never expect a film with the plot i just described based on the first scene in smilla's sense of snow . the moment is spectacular , but when the scene suddenly shifts to modern copenhagen and the film becomes a dark , moody mystery , you might wonder whether you've just had an out-of-genre experience . more to the point , you might fear that august has snapped his cap . actually , august is simply preparing the audience for the radical shift still to come , a shift which wasn't nearly as radical in hoeg's novel . for about three-quarters of its length , smilla's sense of snow is a fairly compelling character study anchored by a strong lead performance . julia ormond may be a bit young for hoeg's smilla , but she makes the character her own with an unapologetic toughness uncommon in female screen characters . screenwriter ann biderman has done a fine job of paring down the novel's often-cumbersome plot and its glut of conspirators , allowing the focus to stay squarely on smilla and her relationships . ormond's performance and august's direction capture hoeg's lyrical , haunting psychological drama , a style reminiscent of _the english patient_ author michael ondaatje . but then there's that third act , and there's nothing august , biderman or anyone else can do about smilla's sense of snow's unexpected metamorphosis from michael ondaatje to michael crichton except take it all the way overboard . the greenland-based climax includes some splendid landscapes by cinematographer jorgen persson , and the arctic vastness suggests the coming of a resolution with an internal dimension -- smilla coming to terms with her life , her land and her heritage . the finale is so utterly bizarre -- and so unsatisfying -- that it taints the entire two hour experience of smilla's sense of snow . 
2	the voting before we went was running about two to one that we should take him , but there was a vocal minority warning us that since jeffrey can frighten easily , we should not get anywhere near the show . five minutes into the movie , jeffrey was in my lap declaring , " we should have gone to muppet treasure island . " notwithstanding his periodic fear during the film , we all three loved it immensely . it is a great mixture of action , humor , special effects , and poignancy . the story skips ahead to 1995 . the logo for this show should have been a whirlwind . getting sucked into the game is pictured as a whirlwind , and the frantic and marvelous pacing by director joe johnston sweeps the audience in as well . a wonderful roller coaster of a good time at the movies to use another metaphor . and funny . the script by jonathan hensleigh , jim strain , and greg taylor , which is based on the book by chris van allsburg , is naturally hilarious with great sight gags . among my many favorites were the monkeys driving the police motorcycle and the one of the flood , but there were many more . the beauty of the story itself is that it naturally sets an horrific pace . be sure and take everyone to the bathroom before entering , you will not be able to miss a minute of this . after the story , the director is the one who deserves the most credit . he knew exactly what he wanted to do and executed precisely . usually extraordinary special effects , as these are , dazzle the audience and focuses the audience's attention on the mechanics of the effects . here , the special effects , i . e . , all of the animals , were great , but they complimented the story rather than dominating it . all of the actors were fine albeit not on par with the story or the directing . robin williams was well cast as a serious and sad character , and the director keep him in control so that williams did slip into his comedic role . it is rated pg for violence , e . g . , a stampede of rhinos , but no one gets killed in the show . there is no sex , nudity , smoking , etc . except for the violence , and that is a big except , this would have been a g rated show . there are no swear words in the show , a minor miracle today . jeffrey says he would recommend it for kids 5 or 6 and up , and he enthusiastically gives it two thumbs up . his dad recommends the movie , but still would caution parents of kids under 10 that the special effects can be terrifyingly real . what if you walked into your bedroom now and a real lion roared at you from your bed ? would you be scared ? finally , i award it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	screenplay : david marconi . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 127 minutes . director tony scott presents what sometimes seems like a documentary on electronic surveillance in enemy of the state . it's a great button-pushing premise for a millenial-angst-heavy information age , full of shadowy government operations and technological voyeurism of every shape and form . the first time a chase scene spills over with surveillance details , it's effective and alarming . the second time , you start to notice that it drags scenes out much longer than they need to be . the third , fourth and fifth times , you wonder why the omniscient gadgetry is beginning to seem more cool than scary . is this a movie about people oppressed by electronics , or a commercial for electronics ? fortunately , the human angle is in the capable hands of will smith . in his first purely starring role -- no buddy cop , no aliens -- smith continues to show the charisma of a star . he's a more effective hounded everyman than you might expect , cracking wise when it serves the moment while generally handling his predicament with intelligence and resolve . hackman arrives fairly late in the film to provide some requisite bonding moments , but mostly the weight of enemy of the state falls squarely on smith's shoulders . he proves more than capable of handling it . he also gets to work with an action/thriller script considerably more coherent than average . the resolution is a rushed disappointment -- mixing in a dopey mob sub-plot just when the table-turning pleasures of dean and brill watching the watchmen had been so promising -- but for nearly two hours it's pretty a effective story . with scott keeping the pacing steady and intense , all the script needs to do is avoid situations so obviously stupid that you feel insulted . marconi's script may not be impressive , but it's unobtrusive , which is one of the higher compliments you can pay an action/thriller script in 1998 . still , there's the matter of all those gee-whiz shots of satellite cams , computer extrapolations and general manipulation of technology . sure it's unsettling to consider that the only privacy you may have is inside your head , but it's most unsettling if we connect with a character connecting with that reality the hard way . will smith provides that humanity almost in spite of scott's inventory of spy gear . the director takes the edge off the edgy concept , turning in a solid thriller that hypes us up when it should be freaking us out . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
1	this is fundamentally a feminist oriented road movie without the politics of the movement playing a part in the story , as the film is steeped in personal irony over abandonment of loved ones and fantasies that can't become real , without any particular message to deliver , except that these two have their hands full coping with their life , as it seems , it is only by their humor and forceful spirit that they can manage to survive . since they consider themselves artists , they feel their act speaks for itself and are particularly upset at being blind sided by one hostile viewer of their show , an overweight lady who feels that they made fun of how obese women look in their act and she felt they did a disservice to women who have that problem , as she upsets them as she rails at them before walking out . since the family treats him as someone not to be taken seriously , yet it is quite evident , that he , alone , has a real love for something that the bourgeois in his family just don't have . a chocolate salesman tells them every one is an actor trying to sell their product , but the important thing is , if you try hard enough people will forgive you for what you are lacking or might not even notice it . that his gimmick is to get the children to eat the chocolate first , then the parents are delighted that the kids like the chocolate , so his sale becomes an easy one . though , what stands out , is the marvelously genuine performances of the heroines of the story and how appealing they were in such a troublesome way , that there public appearance might seem calm and collected , but behind the scenes they are being gnawed at by all the chaos in their life . this thought provoking film , touched many different themes with equal breath and veracity , but this also highlighted its most glaring weakness , that it couldn't focus in on any one theme completely , as it mostly questioned middle-class values and the need for a person to find a way to express themselves enthusiastically , pointing out that maybe , that is all one can hope for , yet leaving so many other things unanswered that it brought up , that you could write your own movie from all that was left unsaid that remains speculative about the girls and their situation . 
0	a fair remake of the 1930 and 1920 versions of this film . a very conventional film . 
2	chopper , written and directed by andrew dominik , is based on the books written by one of australia's most notorious criminals , mark " chopper " read , but the film is careful to point out that the story is not a biography , per se . what it is is a chilling tale that is made even more intriguing by being based on a real criminal . the compelling reason to see chopper is the tour de force performance by eric bana as chopper . ( a reason not to see it , for some , is that it is intense , realistic and graphically violent . ) bana so inhabits his part as chopper that it becomes hard to belief that he is just acting . bana is probably a sweet guy in real life , but , after seeing this movie , you'd probably run away if you met him in public . chopper , looking like a hell's angel with an almost indecipherable aussie accent , has rolls of fat on his beer belly . his skin is tattooed , not with works of body " art " but rather with something that looks more like doodling , and his mouth is filled with shiny metal teeth . between violent episodes in and out of prison , there are some humorous scenes as well . chopper is the kind of guy to whom there are no right answers . although most viewers are probably uncomfortable with such intense experiences as chopper , for those who can stomach it , this movie is a fascinating portrait of a frightening man . and it contains a great performance by eric bana . it is not rated but would be nc-17 for graphic violence , drug usage and language and would be acceptable for college students and older . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
0	chris fiore's backstage , a documentary about touring hip-hop groups from roc-a-fella records and def jam recordings , is a movie for hip-hop fans only . but even die-hard hip-hoppers will probably be disappointed by backstage's proclivity for teasing its audiences with brief excerpts rather than complete songs from the groups' touring concert footage . starring jay-z , dmx , method man , redman , ja rule , and bennie seagel , the movie does have energetic pacing , but i'm at a loss to find anything else good to say about it . with its shameless self-promotion , the documentary could just as easily have been a television infomercial were it not for the movie's plethora of profanity and its sexual episodes . among its low points are the scenes involving the groupies that hang around the stars . on these , fiore has added " cute " little sayings like " your face here " and " your ad here . " see , he is saying , you too could hang around these guys and degrade yourself just like these women . it's a message that we certainly could have done without . many of the scenes have " staged " written all over them . one of the groups , for example , shows us a copy of good will hunting to prove that they watch more than just gangster movies . the performers , in one of their many commercial moments , brag that hip-hop outsells all other types of music . this , for all i know , may be completely true . but their saying it smacks more of gratuitous self-promotion than anything else . let me remind fiore that good documentaries can appeal to a wide audience . this one ignores that rule entirely in favor of cheap theatrics . and , as i've already said , this film doesn't deliver as it should even for its intended audiences . it is also haphazardly edited and poorly shot . many much better films than this one have been unable to obtain a theatrical release , so it is a shame to see this one getting released to theaters . it should have gone directly to video . backstage runs 1 : 39 . 
2	their latest film called james and the giant peach features their claymation , as known as stop-action , images that are their trademark . this time their vision is exuberant and only infrequently morose . the grasshopper ( voice by simon callow ) is an intellectual , the ladybug ( voice by glynis johns ) is a sweet older lady , the spider ( voice by susan sarandon ) is reserved and misunderstood , the earthworm ( voice by david thewlis ) feels like he is always being used , and the best one of all , the centipede ( voice by richard dreyfuss ) , is laugh central . as the jocular main part of the film picks up , the cinematography ( pete kozachik ) makes an abrupt transition and the colors switch to rich and lush oranges and blues . the show is more than just fantastical sights like the giant mechanical shark that attacks them . it also has a plot and a clever boy to guide it . what would you do if a shark attached your giant peach ? bet you didn't think of that one ! his secret is that , " when i have a problem , my mom and dad taught me to look at it another way . " amazing . a show where parents are the good guys and even have advice worth pondering and even remembering . the script is not only clever but funny . the show is full of musical numbers ( randy newman ) , and this is the weakest part of the film . they are not especially good , and paul terry's voice is wonderful as james , but too weak and harsh for singing . the musical numbers are quite slow and may bore some of the more antsy kids in the audience . this movie may not make headlines among all of the adults , but i predict it will among the kids . i got a new front page . it is rated pg for some potentially scary images of charging rhinos and creepy skeletons . i was in a large audience and none of the kids seemed the least bit scared ; nevertheless , it could frighten kids under 5 . like the much better toy story , this film is highly imaginative and willing to take lots of risks . it should inspire creativity and joy in kids of all ages so i recommend it to everyone and award it * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	subtly posing provocative questions about love , religion , family , discrimination and nationalism , the ambitious and successful film has a single significant flaw -- at 3 full hours , it is too short . with a great cast , szab ? introduces so much material that a 6-hour miniseries would have been more appropriate . this however should not dissuade anyone from seeing this version since it does not suffer from being too short , rather it just makes us wish it were longer . ignatz is an ambitious and rather malleable judge who bends too often to the prevailing winds . ehle looks so fetching that it is easy to understand the temptation . this excessive family love will reappear more than once . valerie is a fascinating character in her own right . " you made the right choice -- assimilation is the only way , " adam is congratulated by one of his well-placed friends . the constant changing of the guard in hungary is shown through archival footage into which fiennes is sometimes placed , giving the movie an extra dose of realism . a beautiful film , it has gorgeous cinematography and sumptuous sets , including lavish interiors of government buildings and of wood-paneled coffee houses . it's a good question and naturally doubles back on question of the value of god . from ignatz on , the family motto seems to be that if you don't believe in god , you might as well pledge allegiance to which ever god is most popular , hence the conversion from judaism to christianity and later to stalinism , a state religion . " if there is no god and there never was a god , why do we miss him so much ? " another good question . ultimately the film is about this wandering in the wilderness of life , trying to avoid seeing what we want to ignore and being seen for what we are . it is rated r for sex , violence , language and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
1	traps is an australian film by a very promising first time director , pauline chan . the movie is billed correctly as an erotic thriller . usually when a movie attempts this , it succeeds at one and fails miserably at the other . although audiences may have a hard time envisioning the communists as saviors of simple purity and the french as sadistic nazis , it is not a major problem since the one sided political views of the writers ( robert carter and pauline chan based on the novel " dreamhouse " by kate grenville ) are secondary and easily ignored . as an erotic thriller , it works . the sets by michael philips are just the right gothic blend of realism and surrealism . the audience never knows whether to soak in the beauty of the country ( thanks to the cinematography by kevin haywar ) or be on its guard for some evil lurking around the corner . the wife forms a simple but genuine rapport and empathy for the locals . she seems confused as to why anyone would be fighting anyone there . the other deals with whether anyone will ever make it out alive . both tales work . overall , the picture reminded me of the incredible lightness of being . there are many good scenes . a simple one with a lot of power has the captain volunteering to michael to rub mosquito repellent on louise's shoulders - watch carefully the expressions on everyone's faces , especially louise's . another reason the tension work so well is that the director provides such a feeling of normalcy that is broken periodically by cars running over booby-trapped roads or people shooting at each other in fields . only tuan seems to get it . he tries to tell them , explaining , " here underneath , nothing right , nothing safe . " the acting is all quite good . you felt like she was going to explode at any time and yet she keeps her emotions in check most of the time . she is a beautiful actress who excels at both the erotic and the thriller parts in the movie . i have never seen her act before , but i hope to again . the tension and the images that pauline chan creates in traps made me ready to see her next motion picture as well . although the movie is uneven in parts and its political logic is dubious at best , it does well what it set out to do . traps runs a fast 1 : 36 thanks to crisp editing by nicholas beauman . the movie is in english plus a little french and a little vietnamese with english subtitles . it is correctly rated r for some violence , some nudity , and very explicit and effective sex scenes . i think the movie would be okay for mature teenagers . i recommend traps to you , and i give it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	writer and director david cronenberg enjoys pushing the edge of the envelope . some of his movies , like crash about people who stage auto accidents for sexual arousal , are stylish misses , and others , like existenz about a virtual reality game made solely of biological components , are mesmerizing . the company introducing the game has the building under such tight control that metal detectors screen all entrants . the story's success stems from the concept of the system itself and from the intricate world built around it . the game pod looks like some bodily organs covered with a rubbery outer substance . to connect to the game pod you must have a bioport . a bioport is " just " a hole in your spine in which you attach an umbilical cord-like device that runs to the game pod . just like we have places in the mall to do ear piercing , they have licensed establishments to puncture your spine . ( as you might guess , this being a cronenberg film , one of the few sexual scenes will involve a tongue and a bioport . ) ted doesn't like this idea at all . " i have this phobia about having my body penetrated surgically , " he tells allegra . " you know what i mean ? " if you're squeamish about gore and goo , existenz probably isn't the film for you . the movie becomes a crazy mixed up world like a " twilight zone " episode about a game show on the " surgery channel . " there are wild jokes about how the characters in the game have underwritten roles and are played with bad accents by poorly cast actors . the film , with its steel-gray blue cinematography and its creepy music , never fails to hold your attention . this is all true and is what makes the movie so fascinating to observe . " there is some weird reality effect happening here , " allegra says . " i'm not sure if i get it . " and the story is such a mind trip that most of the audience will be equally and pleasantly confused as well . " i don't know , " he says honestly . " i find this disgusting , but i can't help myself . " my sentiments exactly . and could you please bring on the next course . it is rated r for violence , gore , profanity and sexuality and would be fine for teenagers . 
2	cast : charlotte avery , sabra williams , james dreyfuss , claire higgins , guy williams director : fiona cunningham reid producer : fiona cunningham reid screenplay : geraldine sherman and fiona cunningham reid cinematography : bellinda parsons music : diana mcloughlin and claire van kampen no u . s . distributor thin ice is sort of a low-budget , lesbian version of the cutting edge , and represents one of the better gay romantic comedies to obtain some form of theatrical release . thin ice is fresh , breezy , and never condescending . although this movie involves skating , it's not really about the sport . unlike the cutting edge , which featured extensively choreographed routines performed by professional skating doubles , thin ice uses the actors for every scene , and this means the level of difficulty remains low ( for example , there are no jumps ) . it's the common ground where their vastly different personalities can mesh . as the two cram months of practice into weeks , a friendship -- and perhaps more -- develops . for any romantic comedy to work , a degree of effective chemistry is mandatory between the leads . thin ice has this intangible quality . williams and avery , both giving unforced performances , work well together and , while there's never much overt sensuality in the relationship , it's not difficult to believe that steffi and natalie are in love , even when neither is able or willing to admit the truth . thin ice faithfully follows most of the expected romantic comedy formulas , doing everything with two women that a heterosexual love story might do with a male and female . along the way , several subplots surface ( most dealing with natalie's family life ) that don't add much value to the overall story . fiona cunningham reid , who directed , co-wrote , and produced the film , keeps the tone mostly light and playful . fortunately , that's where thin ice is at its strongest , and most of the running time is used in the advancement of this strength . if there's one message reid is trying to convey ( and it applies to those of all sexual persuasions ) , it's that true love is so hard to find that when it comes along , people should be open to changing their lifestyle to fit their lover rather than changing the lover to fit their lifestyle . 
2	such a label is misleading . like the 1994 documentary , hoop dreams , the basketball court is only an arena for a larger , deeper drama . those in search of a film that ends with a championship match-up will be disappointed -- he got game's only court action takes place in playgrounds and on the street . there's a problem , though -- jesus doesn't want to have anything to do with his father , and jake's increasingly desperate attempts at a reconciliation run into a brick wall . the dynamic between jake and jesus is both believable and poignant , and it reminded me a little of the relationship at the core of in the name of the father , where two emotional strangers come to understand each other . as jesus , nba player ray allen gives a less-convincing performance . while he arguably does the best acting job of any basketball player to appear in a movie , there are times when allen isn't the equal of the material . while there's something vaguely comical about many of these scenes , lee conveys the strain that highly-touted , young athletes are under . with surreptitious cash payments and all sorts of perks so readily available , it's understandable why some high- schoolers make the choices and mistakes that they do . beyond washington and allen , lee has populated the film with a number of credible supporting performers . rosario dawson is convincing as lala , jesus' sexy girlfriend . stylistically , he got game is uneven . the intention is to draw the viewer deeper into the characters' psyches . however , instead of pulling me in , this approach distanced me from the scene , making me aware that i was watching a movie . i have never been overly fond of such " oliver stone-type " flourishes . ultimately , the material that comprises he got game , while compelling and emotionally-satisfying , is not especially original . in fact , this is essentially a familiar story told with consummate skill . while the father/son reunion gives the film its emotional core , the basketball recruiting sequences provide a cynical edge . narratively , however , he got game is hurt by a contrived setup and a hokey , overly- sentimental final scene . it's the stuff in between that makes this a worthwhile experience , which it surely is . " my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . " -- david puttnam 
1	one character says of the farm , it is in such a remote spot , even the coyotes don't come here . it's a marriage consumed by hate . " deep valley " offers a dramatic look at how love can make one feel alive again . the film comes to a boil with its very moving conclusion , after a very slow start . the acting is first-rate , making these melodramatics seem realistic . 
1	the original air bud was a delightful disney film in the old yeller tradition of a boy and his dog . more than a comedy , it was a touching little film with some very sweet scenes . its sequel , air bud : golden receiver , shares little with the spirit of the original . it stars a golden retriever , but not the original one . the film has the same writers as before , paul tamasy and aaron mendelsohn , but the script they came up with less than a year later feels rushed . totally devoid of ideas other than letting a dog run around on a football field , the movie has lame jokes and ineffective subplots . all of the rest of the actors are different . they do share a common trait in being given little of interest to say or do . typical of the recycled humor is the date that comes to see josh's mom ( cynthia stevenson ) . there will be much made of josh's resentment that his mother is dating , but the director , richard martin , the second unit director on air bud , is unable to stage these scenes with any genuine feelings . of all the ridiculous subplots , the one of the stupid russian animalnappers is the worst . the movie would be infinitely better and fifteen minutes shorter without them . only on the field does the movie work . when buddy lines up , does calisthenics , or whatever , he is funny . but this sight gag is not enough to sustain a full-length movie . dick plays a senile man who offers such colorful remarks as the way to win is to score more points than the other team . one would hope that seniors' groups might picket the movie . ) one part of the movie that is refreshing , albeit not especially believable , is that the coach isn't really interested very much in winning . it is rated g and would be fine for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 9 , really liked the film , giving it * * * * . 
0	the third dull hollywood film about mars in a little over a year , after tim burton's " mars attacks ! " i would think that three strikes and you're out should apply to any more of these space bombs cast into theaters by producers with big budgets and small stories . this one's a nuts-and- bolts sci-fier that looks good but its dialogue is just terrible , with the capable cast unable to overcome the poorly plotted story and saying things like val kilmer is forced to say about mars , " things happen on mars that are extreme and otherworldly . " the characters are either undeveloped or predictable stock characters . south african director anthony hoffman directs without imagination , as the film seems to drag on at a lethargic pace . the " red planet " was also void of humor and the obstacles encountered by the astronauts seemed arbitrarily thrown into the film to purposefully give the film an excuse for the special effects to be the star . i think hollywood should reevaluate its plans to make these special effect only films about mars and see if they can go back to the drawing board and put some life into these stories about the earth's last frontier . those b-movies made in the 1950s on a shoestring budget were more entertaining to me than this large-scale leaden sci-fi adventure story . the other crew members are so boring and one-dimensional , that when they started getting picked off one by one , for one reason or another , i was rooting for a more efficient way of getting rid of them , maybe picking up the pace at two at a time killings . this was some crew , lacking in credibility , wit and likability ! the mars lander descends to the surface with gallagher , burchenal , santen , pettengil and chantilas . we then get into the special effects part of the film , the only thing the film can brag about , as there's a well-photographed crash landing scene . did god do it ? it's an interesting theme , but this film was only able to grab onto its spectacular special effects ( showing the mars earth mysteriously moving ) and by proving that there is life on mars , and was not able to follow through on any ideas invested in the far-reaches of the story . i thought the film lacked suspense , and the acting was only bearable , not giving this film too much of a chance to overcome its overall dullness . if you are the kind of viewer who goes bananas for technology , this film might seem better to you than what i thought of it , as that part of the film was stunning , indeed . but if you are interested in a lively story , then i'm afraid you wouldn't get that on this mission . 
2	cast : virginie ledoyen , benoit magimel , dominique valadie , vera briole director : benoit jacquot producers : philippe carcassonne , brigitte faure screenplay : benoit jacquot , jerome beaujour cinematography : caroline champetier u . s . distributor : strand releasing in french with subtitles rarely has any film so accurately and effectively captured the essence of a human being -- the look , the feel , the mannerisms , the vocal inflections . benoit jacquot's a single girl isn't a typical motion picture in any sense . narrative is curtailed in favor of pure character development , and the result is akin to suspending your own life for ninety minutes and spending that time living in someone else's skin . it's extremely unusual for a director , actress , and writer to bring an audience into such a close rapport with a character . not once in seventy-five minutes does jacquot's film transition away from valerie or jump forward in time . it is strictly chronological , presenting a minute in real time as a minute in screen action . the camera follows valerie's every move , no matter how mundane . she's not just in every scene , she's in practically every frame . yet , even though the voyeuristic perspective of the camera allows us intimate access to valerie's thoughts and actions , it is not invasive , nor is it interested in exploitation . this scene clearly indicates what the director's motives are ( and aren't ) in telling this particular story in this manner . not only does ledoyen have a pleasant countenance for the camera to dote upon longingly , but she's a shrewd actress who understands the importance of details in making the character real . there are numerous occasions when we understand valerie's mindset and intentions as a result of some subtle action : a gesture , an expression , or a mannerism . yes , ledoyen is beautiful , but it's her aptitude , not her comeliness , that draws us in . it's a nice addition that offers a sense of closure to the story and answers many of the questions that couldn't have been resolved had jacquot decided to restrict the entire movie to one time-frame . it's a credit to everyone involved that the growth and change of several years can be conveyed in such a relatively short sequence . when a character study fails , it is , more often than not , because the audience never really connects with the film's protagonist . this is a flaw that never plagues a single girl , because jacquot bends all of his film making talents to forging a deep link . as a result , even though nothing much happens during the course of the movie ( valerie spends over half the running time wandering around the inside of a hotel ) , this is a thoroughly engrossing motion picture . this is one single girl i wouldn't mind spending more time with . 
0	a too obvious derivative supernatural thriller , most imitative of " rosemary's baby , " but without the same fresh intensity and without a credible script . what it had going for it , was a sleek look ( the cinematography was simply out of this world ) and an able workmanlike craftsmanship . rand ravich does a fine job directing his initial film , but fails miserbly with the storytelling part of his script . this results in a film that is watchable but not believable . in this arty mystery , which doesn't have too much mystery if you watched a few of these supernatural films before , spencer and streck come back different men from what they were before they experienced the two minutes of mystery . without a mystery to end on , the film becomes banal , having established no point of view and having nothing to say about space travel , it just becomes a predictable guessing game of how jillian will defend herself against her husband , someone who is really not her husband . 
1	the commercials for in the mouth of madness remind us that john carpenter is the man behind arguably the best modern horror film , halloween . however , despite what the marketeers might wish us to believe , the pictures have little in common except for a few well-orchestrated scares . halloween was creepy , atmospheric , cunningly scripted , and frightening . in the mouth of madness is confusing , weird , and not very involving . it's easy to sit back and impassively be impressed by some of what in the mouth of madness attempts to do . without gratuitous sex or gore , the film works to create an intelligent horror experience that mixes nightmares , reality , and fantasy . this is a tactic employed by the far better wes craven's last nightmare , and here it feels a bit like a retread . also , in pursuit of all his nifty ideas and mind-bending twists , writer michael de luca forgot to fashion believable characters . despite a magnificently-entertaining performance by sam neill , his john trent never really connects on any level with the audience . in trying to be inventive and unique , the story occasionally manages instead to annoy and confuse . there's too much of the dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream and other similar stuff going on . a little of this might have created a nice sense of ambiguity , but carpenter overdoes it . as a result , his story gets buried too deeply beneath the overriding question of whether trent is real and insane or a fictional character who's the only one aware of what's going on . at this point , we're reminded of sleepy castle rock in needful things . admittedly , an intellectual horror story is infinitely preferable to a gory slasher flick , but in the mouth of madness falls a step short of being a worthy entry . the final , missing ingredient--whether it's a hero we can really root for , a more engaging script , or a better actress as linda--leaves carpenter's latest firmly grounded in mediocrity . and , looking back to halloween , we know he's capable of rising far above that . maybe his next film , a remake of village of the damned , will remind us of the kind of great horror the director can give us . 
2	screenplay : david sheffield , barry w . blaustein , tom shadyac , steve oedekerk . director : tom shadyac . if you ask most movie stars whether a given project is a " comeback , " they would probably insist that they were never away . in the case of eddie murphy , that's actually pretty close to the truth . _you_ may not have seen harlem nights , or the distinguished gentleman , or boomerang , or even beverly hills cop iii , but someone did -- over $300 million worth of someones , in fact . so no , eddie murphy never went anywhere ; it was only his ability to make people laugh which took a long vacation . i was beginning to wonder whether there was any of the old spark left in murphy , and then along comes the nutty professor . he still might have trouble identifying a decent script , but his talent is in full flower , including an unexpectedly broad acting range . murphy plays sherman klump , a brilliant chemistry professor with a bit of a weight problem -- about 400 lbs . worth . the result is a startling transformation of sherman klump into buddy love , a lean , mean testosterone machine who is every bit the party animal sherman never was . the lion's share of the pleasures in the nutty professor are pure eddie murphy , but not necessarily eddie murphy the way you are accustomed to seeing him . there are some big laughs in those family dinner scenes , particularly an extraordinarily embarrassing dinner with carla in attendance , although the flatulence gags are piled on a bit thick . but murphy is not coasting on his street-wise motor-mouth persona here , the persona which often seemed to be the only reason for dud projects like the golden child or the distinguished gentleman to exist . if anything , the nutty professor is a chance to poke fun at that persona through the hyper-slick buddy love . buddy is the arrogant , self-absorbed misogynist everyone probably believes murphy really is , and he knows enough to tweak that image for all he's worth . the real surprise is watching murphy sink his teeth into a real character , and do some real acting . murphy brings out that side as something endearing , and makes his shy , self-effacing manner terrifically appealing . i never thought i would see the day when eddie murphy would play a character who inspired sympathy , but watching klump disintegrate before a barrage of the comedian's barbs is genuinely poignant . murphy is so good that it's too bad he doesn't have better material to work with , or a more supportive supporting cast . for the most part , the script is all set-up with few truly inspired comic situations , relying on absurdist dream sequences and special effects for the big gags . there are moments when buddy love is on screen that you are waiting for murphy to run to the extreme , and ace ventura director tom shadyac just seems to be waiting for him to do something wacky . the script doesn't really give him the best opportunities , though , and he is playing off undeserving foils in jada pinkett and an uncomfortably edgy larry miller . murphy is trying to show what he can do here , and he is given material like the overly obvious homily at the film's conclusion which doesn't show trust in his abilities to convey emotion without spelling it all out . those abilities turn out to be what makes the nutty professor so much fun . welcome back , eddie , even if you never went away . 
2	it's the romantic buried inside each of us that responds to movies like emma . sure , the film , like the jane austen novel upon which it is based , is laced with wit and sophistication . in the wake of persuasion , sense and sensibility , and a&e's stupendous pride and prejudice , there's not a great deal of mystery about the audience to which emma will appeal . although the plot differs slightly from the other austen books-to-movies , many of the themes and riffs are the same . emma herself is unattached , but , since this is a jane austen story , it's obvious that won't last for long . it's possible that the storyline for emma may seem curiously familiar to movie-goers , even those who haven't seen the previous austen adaptations . this straight adaptation works better , but clueless is not without its charms . speaking of star-making turns , emma is likely to open eyes to the talent of its leading lady , gwyneth paltrow , who gives face , form , and expression to emma . paltrow , who was excellent in 1993's flesh and bone ( before moving on to films like seven and the pallbearer ) , displays the essential characteristic of an actress wishing to play a jane austen heroine -- the ability to shift quickly and effectively from comedy to drama . she can cry , look wistful , and deliver a biting line with equal believability . paltrow is supported by a fine cast . jeremy northam , who harassed sandra bullock in the net , is an excellent choice for the dashing knightley . emma lacks the depth of passion present in the other austen films , but , in large part because it's trying for something lighter and breezier , it's still fun . the film runs a little longer than seems necessary , and gets off to a slow , fitful start ( douglas mcgrath's screenplay is not the equal of the other austen adaptations ) , but paltrow keeps us interested until the story's inherent romantic magic begins to weave its spell . it's hard to give a definitive answer at this time , but , judging from the lines at the box office , that seems unlikely . there's something about the writer's view of life that appeals to modern audiences , and , if emma proves to be a financial success , it's almost a certainty that we'll be seeing a new , feature adaptation of either northanger abbey or mansfield park in the near future . 
0	this very ordinary story is related in soap opera style , evoking heart tugging sympathy for the victim . how could you not feel sorry for her ? the steven rogers's script adds a bit of conflict to the story by having the mother-daughter relationship be strained . that took care of that little conflict . at this point of the film , i was hoping for some comedy or music to break out , like someone singing : matchmaker , matchmaker , make me a match . . . this film just couldn't move me with this familiar storyline ; its purpose was to try and get me so misty eyed for these two nice people who can't find romance together . but by the film's conclusion , there is the predictable happy ending , with the virtues of a nuclear family back in tack . i guess this is ok , because you really can't root against them , and the way this film was slowly moving along , with lots of wasted artistic shots of the small-town that had no impact on the story ; at least , it satisfied an audience who would appreciate seeing such a clean-cut and prosaic romance . it was truely a woman's picture . the nicest thing about this film was that it made for pleasant viewing . there was nothing to really get upset about . sandra bullock is very pretty and very nice . and then one day i looked and i was gone . " that is also commendable . the problem with all this , is that these topics are very similar to the real life situations of many americans , but this film adds no new insights to the problems or any kind of humanity to it . it just ends on an uninspired happy note . it , therefore , was unable to rise to the emotional level needed to sustain a sense of drama . the result is : that there is nothing special about this film to recommend it , nor is there anything particularly horrid about it to urge you to avoid it . 
0	if it were an episode of a kid's television series , which is what it feels like , it would rank a little below average . tune into the disney channel on a random afternoon , and you'll find something similar and probably better . the three first-time screenwriters , jonathan bernstein , mark blackwell and james greer , couldn't think of any fresh material . the shame of it all is that some of the young actors manage to show some special sparks in a movie that's almost terminally bland . they both possess a likable spunk that makes them interesting even when their characters aren't . the adults are uniformly awful , especially robert carradine as max's doofus dad and larry miller as the school's unprincipled principal . and , like my dead audience , you probably won't be having much fun either . the surprise is that this junior high school comedy , which is aimed more to the seven-year-old set , doesn't have much in it that's funny for any age group , even the younger ones . it is rated pg for " some bullying and crude humor " and would be acceptable for kids of all ages . my son jeffrey , age 12 , who had trouble thinking of anything that he liked about the movie , gave it * 1/2 . he checked his watch frequently , something that i suspect everyone will be doing in this short movie that feels extra long . in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
1	this creepy serial killer tale had all the more fright in it than the more highly touted " felicia's journey , " and was a superior telling of a homicidal maniac on the prowl story than the more flamboyant venture " american psycho " was . i take the natural momentum of a person and draw it towards me . you don't always choose what you do , sometimes what you do chooses you . " hampton fancher , the blade runner screenwriter and the first-time director of " the minus man , " creates a film that sets a dark mood of everyday normal life contrasted by the cheery personality of vann , who looks like the average " joe , " easily fitting into his surroundings . he is such a well-mannered and congenial young man , whose appeal is supposed to make us irritated that we can like someone like him . the emptiness of his action , and the film's emphasis on his charms , while keeping his past mysterious , adds chills to his moody persona . but , because he is so polite , he does not arouse the trooper's suspicions and therefore no search of the vehicle takes place . this is a different kind of part for the usually gruff garofalo . what carries the day for this film about the banality of evil , which presents its story as a mind game owen wilson is playing , is the strong performances by him and brian cox , as they both are good at conveying men who are psychologically damaged goods . the film gets over , despite its weakness of allowing the serial killer to be someone whom we can never understand or come to terms with . these weird killings do happen in present society , and when we read about them in the newspapers , we even know less about 'why' than we do here . in the characterization wilson gave to this psychopath , you could see how his normalcy wasn't normal , and maybe that's about all we know about most serial killers . but , we can't let society off the hook as generously as we do in the newspapers , and what makes this film particularly engaging , at least more engaging than most of the serial killer films i have seen recently , is that in this film the sickness in society also becomes part of understanding why these weird things happen . what is unsaid becomes , at least , pointed out as to where we should start looking for answers , if we can only stop looking at the conventional places where we usually look and start looking at ourselves as a society and what we have created . i just wish this film had more body in it , more of a feeling for what it was up to , something more revealing . 
1	10 things i hate about you ( touchstone ) starring : julia stiles , heath ledger , joseph gordon-levitt , larisa oleynik , david krumholtz , andrew keegan , larry miller . screenplay : karen mccullah lutz & kristen smith . director : gil junger . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 94 minutes . it seems like only a few weeks ago -- probably because it was -- that i was inveighing against the slew of " fill-in-the-blank , but with teenagers " movies . still they show no sign of abating , with a shudder-inducing sub-category creeping to the forefront : shakespeare , but with teenagers . by all rights it should have been as incredibly heinous as other recent juvenile jaunts , but it's actually kinda cute on occasion . though still too concerned with cozying up to its audience's sensibilities , 10 things at least offers a blueprint for how to make such material a bit more appealing . 10 things gets a leg up on most of its genre cousins simply by putting people on the screen who can act a lick . julia stiles is a charming , smart and fresh presence as kat , giving here attitude a little something more than _just_ attitude ; australian actor heath ledger makes for a nice foil with his combination of hulking presence and sensitivity ; and david krumholtz has a solid comic relief role as cameron's nerdy comrade . the adult roles are also satisfying for a change , primarily because they aren't used simply as walls off of which teens can bounce insults . i actually found myself chuckling at most of these characters instead of wishing desperately that they'd just go away . much of the credit for that should also go to writers karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith , who give the dialogue a bite that goes beyond insult humor and high school patois . some of the best lines are unprintable -- including patrick's curiosity over why bianca is so desirable -- but they all seem to have been given at least a little thought . while the situations are teen-film predictable -- a party scene , a prom scene , plenty of threats and posturing -- occasionally the writing emerges to deliver an unexpected laugh . it's not brilliant , but it's a sharp step up from stupid . as likeable as parts of 10 things aare , it's hard to get overly enthusiastic about it . veteran sit-com director gil junger , making his feature debut , slaps on a generous coat of sit-com glossiness , leaving little room for the truly acidic wordplay of a " taming of the shrew . " it's a warm and fuzzy sort of teen film with some welcome positive messages about independent thought and valuing depth of character , yet it still rarely rises above the level of the blandly generic . it might have had a chance if so many sub-plots hadn't been packed into a tight 94-minute package , short-changing them all with shallowness . still , it's enough of a surprise to find a teen film that doesn't overstay its welcome instantly , let alone deserves more fleshing out . it's enough to give you hope that there's actually a good movie to be made in 1999 " . . . with teenagers .

0	although based on a true story , as the movie reminds us , the preachy and overlong film stretches credulity at every turn . as directed by tom shadyac and written by steve oedekerk , who worked together on the recent remake of the nutty professor , the movie should come complete with two warnings . first , the fda should serve notice to the audience . although the agency knows that the ingestion of large quantities of artificial sweeteners can kill lab rats , the effect on audiences of such a sickeningly sweet script have not been tested . second , parents should be on notice that the film , quite unlike its happy trailers , is full of death and dying . the realism is more than one might expect from the film's marketing and its pg-13 rating . jokes about masturbation and gynecologist's stirrups are just a few of the movie's questionable inclusions that may surprise parents expecting lighter fare . the syrupy script feeds him lines that sound more like readings than conversations . the nefarious dean gets the worst of the cliched lines . the movie , heavy on messages , has as a basic theme that it isn't the drugs and the operations that will save your life . what you need is a feel-good doctor . and if he doesn't cure you , at least you'll die a little bit happier . these bald , cancer-stricken kids are genuine and cute , the only such characters in the story . the movie lets robin cut up for no reason other than getting some cheap laughs . to the cheering audience of conventioneers . what -- you may ask -- is this scene doing in this movie ? movies like patch adams need aids to help you through it . when you have trouble falling asleep , you count sheep . it almost seems that he manages to wear more shirts than there are scenes in the movie . there may be other survival tricks , but , hopefully , this one will suffice . patch adams runs too long at 1 : 55 . it is rated pg-13 for frightening scenes of death and dying , profanity and crude humor and would be acceptable for kids over 12 . my son jeffrey , age 9 , was bored and upset by the film , giving it only * ? . he liked some of the humor such as the invisible squirrels' scene . he didn't like the " bad words " and complained that the movie was way too sad . his friend alan , age 9 , liked the way the film was " funny and disgusting " but thought it was too sad . he generously gave it * * * . 
1	with an established pedigree in lavish costume drama from his respected restoration , hoffman might seem a natural to cook up something special for viewers . he combines some of hollywood's finest acting ingredients but comes up with little more than leftover hash . the opening credits explain that it was a time when the bustle was on the wane and the bicycle was on the rise , which were compatible trends . this humor is typical of the too-cute-to-be-funny level upon which the movie operates . when the actors , dressed in 19th century costumes , begin to speak the language of shakespeare , it grates on the nerves like watching john wayne with japanese dubbing . the sets are sumptuous , the cinematography handsome , and the operatic music stirring . so long as the actors aren't speaking , the movie is a feast for the eyes and ears , much like restoration . a midsummer night's dream should have you alternately laughing and grinning , but hoffman's version leaves one staring quizzically , never knowing quite what to make of it . with a killer cast and a great play , he manages to make the poetically beautiful surprisingly bland . many of the actors shine above the dullness of the direction . with bewitching twitching , she flits about the set with unbounded energy and infectious good spirits . neither give especially memorable performances , but looks count for a lot when you have to sit through such a sleep-inducing production . and if you've ever needed a reason to believe in fairies , pfeiffer , as a fairy , supplies a most convincing argument . kevin kline gets to chew up the scenery playing a bad actor named bottom . he makes an especially convincing ass during one of the fairy sequences . it is supposed to be laughably bad but is , instead , merely bad . stanley tucci , who seems to enjoy every movie he's in , has a playful , good time as puck . hoffman , who also wrote the screen adaptation , makes many strange staging choices ; none more so than having flockhart engage in mud wrestling . like so much of the movie , this scene is more weird than funny . given all of the other liberties hoffman takes with the play , it is a shame that he didn't shortened it more . this version quickly becomes tedious and frequently drags . if he had brought the picture in at an hour and a half , it could only have helped . this would be the perfect tagline for this production for it is indeed quite foolishly done . on the other hand , lame shakespeare is still shakespeare . it is rated pg-13 for lots of partial nudity usually covered up with strategically placed hair and flowers . the film would be fine for kids around 11 and up . 
1	don't make the mistake of assuming that " 187 " is gritty , urban classroom drama in the mold of dangerous minds . but this story isn't about the amazing power of dedicated teachers to effect change in the face of socio-economic hardships and an oppressive tie-in soundtrack . " 187 " is a horror movie . at least that's what it _should_ have been . for most of the time he is on the screen , jackson generates a tension which threatens to explode at any moment . his performance is raw and haunting , like a priest experiencing a crisis of faith . credit jackson with an insight screenwriter scott yagemann and director kevin reynolds both lack . yagemann's script -- full to bursting with good teachers ( kelly rowan ) and bad teachers ( john heard ) , good students ( karina arroyave ) and bad students -- fairly yanks the outrage out of us with pliers , dwelling on the unconscionable conditions and trite confrontations . reynolds , meanwhile , perhaps in an attempt to create an atmosphere of surreality , opens up the film school grab-bag -- dizzying 360 degree tracking shots , blurred focus , black-and-white video footage , jittery hand-held camera work , slow motion , rust-tinged cinematography . it is a dreadfully misguided choice . every flashy gimmick proves distancing and distracting , pulling us away from the painful reality of garfield's life . it's clear that the makers of " 187 " want to leave viewers angry and frustrated . and they succeed , though not in the way they intended . we don't need another film to drag us into the classroom to show us how bad things are . we don't need another film to lecture to us , or to try to impress us with cinematic puffery . only in a riveting climax do we ever get a chance to see garfield in his darkest moments , as reynolds and yagemann create a pointless did-he-or-didn't-he mystery . this could have been the urban high school film which has been begging to be made for years , one which avoids inanely and simplistically describing that world as " gritty " or " tough . " the appropriate word is " terrifying . " the appropriate mood is horror . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
1	this film was adapted from a lucille fletcher 22-minute radio drama , where agnes moorehead played the invalid heiress leona stevenson . the film plays on one's fears of being alone and of being physically handicapped . the film uses the method of flashback to enlarge the story . the film is well executed , mainly through the efforts of the director and the star of the film . even as an intolerable woman , casting herself in self-imprisonment , she engineers our sympathy for her current plight , as we see that she desperately needs psychological treatment more than anything else . 
0	a mindless psychological thriller set in vermont , that starts out in a promising mysterious fashion but ends badly , ruining any credibility it might have generated . it tries very hard to be both a mystery and a supernatural story , but it goes off course on both its aims way before it sinks to its low abyss . it was a film that was all foreplay but couldn't come to a climax , and as the film started to clear up the mystery mood it created while moving at its snail pace , the revelations of the mystery weren't worth exploring . the only thing the film did well , was provide a lot of schlock . the result is a dull film , with uninteresting and poorly developed characters , and too many manipulative fright scenes that i have seen before in too many other horror flicks . the only thing this film did really well aside from all its schlock setups , was photograph the lakeside lake champlain area and use the champlain bridge for some eerie shots . the story seemed to drag from the onset , as the director wasted time taking irrelevant long shots aimed to be frightening and then turning away from those shots without drawing anything out of them ; it should have been an eighty minute film , like the b- movies of the 1950s , and then it might have been a more tolerable venture . robert zemeckis ( " forrest gump " / " contact " / " back to the future " ) is such an emotionally empty director , his characters seem more like robots than humans , that the movie seems to be such an effort in draining the life out of it that it becomes mostly a special effect movie with characters becoming secondary in importance . zemeckis has built a story around a lady-in-peril , one with too much idle time , who is overwrought with a healthy dose of neurotic tension , talking herself into thinking she sees ghosts , but who doesn't know how to internalize that fright . michelle pfeiffer is asked to carry this film , but without an adequate script , even if she is a good casting decision for that role , her task is too difficult to accomplish . the last shocking scene takes place in a bathtub , one that could have been ordered from the sears catalogue before world war 11 , and seems to be ready-made for a horror flick . if this is supposed to be like a hitchcockian thriller , then why wasn't i thrilled by what i saw ! zemeckis has created an unaffecting haunted house thriller , with samples from many other films thrown into this derivative stew , but nothing seems to work here . this is just a boring movie about a couple that are as unreal as the ghosts in their house . 
2	hearts in atlantis is a sweet , touching and rather usual film that is based on a stephen king novel . no , it's not a horror movie . but , what is it exactly ? as the story evolves with quiet power , it is never clear where it is going or what kind of movie it will become . a low-key foreboding serves more as part of the ambiance than as a hint of the future . if the movie , directed by scott hicks ( shine ) and written by william goldman ( butch cassidy and the sundance kid ) , must be characterized , it might be as stand by me 2 . the well cast film is a character study that revolves around relationships . the most prophetic of these is , " sometimes when you're young , you have moments of such happiness , you think you're living in someplace magical , like atlantis must have been . young love has rarely been shot with more honesty and delicacy . it is the sort of performance that will have you scratching your head wondering where you have seen her before . the more important question is whether producers will recognize her potential and give her the parts she deserves so that she becomes the next meg ryan and not the next molly ringwald . it is rated pg-13 for " violence and thematic elements , " and would be acceptable for kids around 10 and up . in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
1	starring : mike myers , dana carvey , christopher walken , tia carrere director : stephen surjik producer : lorne michaels screenplay : mike myers , bonnie turner , and terry turner music : carter burwell and various artists released by paramount pictures the original wayne's world boasted a number of clever bits and parodies glued together by a silly plotline , but at least it was something a new , and a little different . wayne's world 2 boasts far fewer clever bits and parodies glued together by a nonsensical plotline , and there's absolutely nothing remotely new or different about this sequel . it isn't appalling , but it's not worth a trip to the theaters , either . there are some worthwhile moments in wayne's world 2 , but not enough to justify the filming of a movie . that's about it , though , and even the funniest parts are far-from- original . in fact , you'd be hard-pressed to find anything in this movie that's unique . even more unfortunate is that wayne's world 2 is in the unenviable position of having been outdone by the movie preview before it . packaged along with the feature presentation is a trailer for paramount's march release the naked gun 33 1/3 , and this 90-second gem is far better than anything that wayne's world 2 has to offer . in addition to myers and carvey , tia carrere also returns , although her character is relegated to a disjointed subplot that involves an underscripted slimeball record producer played by christopher walken ( who does a marvellous job acting as if he's playing the heavy in a serious movie ) . there are a number of cameos--by kim basinger , drew barrymore , heather locklear , charlton heston , kevin pollack , olivia d'abo , jay leno , rip taylor , aerosmith , and others - but few of these provide anything beyond juvenile puns and one-liners . at times , wayne's world 2 tries to be like the naked gun , and falls flat on its face . in the final analysis , wayne's world 2 lacks inspiration , and uses up ninety-five minutes trying to find some . as far as sequels go , this is definitely not the worst of the year , and there are enough moments to provide satisfaction to those who go in with suitably-limited expectations , but this shtick is getting old . this is mass-market comedy at its least impressive . 
1	if it does nothing else , the ghost and the darkness will make you realize just how brilliant steven spielberg's execution of jaws is . using a similar ( albeit land-bound ) premise -- hunting down bloodthirsty predators -- this movie devolves into a silly series of animal attacks and chases . the camerawork is frenetic and confusing , and the big confrontations are as likely to provoke unintentional laughter as edge- of-the-seat excitement . in his 1975 thriller , spielberg proved that the man-against- beast struggle , if done properly , can make for a compelling motion picture . with the ghost and the darkness , director stephen hopkins tries unsuccessfully to generate the same level of tension . while hopkins' film making skills aren't of the same caliber as spielberg's ( one man made a nightmare on elm street 5 ; the other , schindler's list ) , the lion's share of the blame for this movie's failure can be laid squarely on the shoulders of veteran screenwriter william goldman , whose script is contrived and inadequate . in jaws , it was thrilling to watch the failed attempts to kill the enemy ; here , it's just frustrating . actually , taken as high camp , it's possible to enjoy the ghost and the darkness on a reasonably consistent basis . in addition to giving kilmer and douglas some wonderfully loony lines of dialogue , the script spends a lot of time on unnecessarily convoluted schemes to kill the beasts . somehow , i don't think hopkins intended this scene to be as funny as it is . there is a promising , although largely unexplored , story buried within the ghost and the darkness . building a railroad bridge across the tsavo river has the potential to generate some potent drama . of course , the ghost and the darkness is only interested in this material as background , so no attempt is made to examine the pressures and difficulties of railroad construction . and , man-eating animals aside , what about the inherent difficulties of raising such an imposing structure under stringent time and environmental constraints ? at first , i thought the film makers' reluctance to give us a good , clear view of them was to build suspense . unfortunately , it becomes clear that the real reason has more to do with poor special effects than a desire to tease the audience . the animatronic lions look terrible . one wonders why , with all the impressive twisters and spaceships that were zipping around on screens this summer , the ghost and the darkness can't come up with a pair of credible lions . val kilmer is either badly miscast , bored , or a combination of the two . his patterson is dull and largely unsympathetic . as a hero , he leaves a lot to be desired . unfortunately , douglas doesn't show up until the film is half over , so it's necessary to struggle through the first forty-five minutes without his energetic boost . for those who are interested in observing the habits of real lions and viewing genuine life-and-death struggles in africa , i direct your attention to the leopard son , which is still in theatrical release . that well-constructed documentary has stronger drama , tension , and cinematography than the supposedly-real story told in the ghost and the darkness . true , it's missing tom wilkinson sneering , michael douglas smirking , and val kilmer looking bored , but no movie can boast everything . -- ingmar bergman 
0	mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , scatalogical humor ) running time : 92 minutes . george of the jungle suffers from a fundamental , insurmountable split personality : it wants both to be a big , dumb comedy for 8-year-olds and to make fun of the fact that it is a big , dumb comedy for 8-year-olds . the former is fairly easy , particularly for disney , whose recent contributions like jungle2jungle and d ( whatever integer the mighty ducks series is up to lately ) make you wonder why they don't just spin off a live-action banner called big dumb comedies for 8-year-olds pictures . the latter , however , requires subtlety . . . finesse . . a keen sense of how far is just far enough . now that you have lifted yourself off the floor from convulsions of laughter , i'll confirm your suspicions that george of the jungle does not represent the platonic form of subtlety , finesse , or a keen sense of how far is just far enough . there are pratfalls and comic brawls a-plenty . and there are at least 475 separate gags involving either a ) flatulence , b ) excrement , c ) urine or d ) injuries or the threat of injury to the male gonads . all of which works just fine on its own level , except that screenwriters dana olsen and audrey wells then feel obliged to get meta-conscious on us . most films of this stripe would be perfectly comfortable simply serving up a scene where a nasty character like ursula's erstwhile fiance lyle van de groot ( thomas haden church ) falls face first into a steaming elephant pile . classic element of physical comedy ! " it's tough to take a film seriously as a wry commentary on its own excesses , especially when those excesses are the main reason the majority of the audience is watching . george of the jungle's attempts at something resembling sophistication and wit , half-hearted though they may be , are clearly an attempt to capture the spirit of the animated namesake created by jay ward ( of " rocky and bullwinkle " fame ) . they also demonstrate a radical misunderstanding of what was amusing about ward's efforts . like " rocky and bullwinkle , " " george of the jungle " was smart satire rich with exaggerated word-play . it also featured a lunk-headed hero played completely straight , a far jungle cry from the sensitive noble savage served up by brendan fraser . there's nothing to connect this george of the jungle to jay ward's " george of the jungle " except the theme song , which is probably the one thing most people will remember about the animated series . those who remember more may be hoping for more than this predictable kiddie matinee posing as savvy family entertainment . calling a critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist . ' " 
1	and , still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense , of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line . in the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything . the scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david's view but coming at it from a much different angle . it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies . that the director's point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point . the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters . what can one expect out of life ? the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way . that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white . no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic . there is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don't like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically . that is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference . perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene . 
0	i can think of three reasons why howie long will likely never be a major action star : his face doesn't always wear the same impassive expression . unfortunately , the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle , firestorm , which is just plain awful . one of the most glaring problems with long ( who made his acting debut in john woo's broken arrow ) is that he's so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery . unfortunately , despite the best efforts of first-time director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costner's work in the postman look stark , jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy . to put it kindly , this is not a well-written motion picture . firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines set against a backdrop of disaster movie clich ? s which , taken together , form something that requires a level of viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot . the only reason this film is getting one star ( instead of something lower ) is that most of the fire sequences are realistic , and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively . but this day , our big burly hero's first in charge , isn't going to be business-as-usual . unfortunately , that's firestorm's lone asset , and it falters near the end , when computer-generated special effects fill up the screen . these are of about equal quality to what you might observe on a nintendo 64 video game . the action sequences , which include a variety of chases , are occasionally interesting , but never invigorating . everyone , including long , appears to be going through the motions . there isn't a memorable performance to be found from beginning to end , unless you count the forest fire , which generates some heat . he's worse than a generic bad guy ; he's a boring generic bad guy who doesn't have any snappy one-liners to hurl at our big burly hero . there's some small comfort in knowing this early in the year that i already have one entry for my bottom 10 list . ( at least i hope there aren't 10 worse films than this . ) and i know i wasn't the only one who really disliked this movie . as the audience was filing out of the screening , i loitered in the theater lobby to catch a few comments . the general consensus seemed to be that , although the movie sucked , the promotional key ring was cool . the problem is that fox won't be giving out key rings to regular movie-goers , so that nixes any reason to see firestorm . - ingmar bergman 
1	you get a film with a few subplots in it for the ticket price of one here . but you ultimately get what you pay for , and here the main story becomes tiring and the secondary story is oedipal and underplayed , and the other subplots are pointless , so what you really get is the main story being compromised by the subplots , which weakens the main story into a formula-driven one . the main story is a homage to the movie " wall street " and its message of greed but , at least , it comes without the moral piety of oliver stone . yet , he still stays with the firm , something the film couldn't really show why , even though they tried explaining it with a subplot of a ruptured father/son relationship . the story's other subplot is a frenetic tale of white men in their twenties with lots of testosterone to burn , who just want to be millionaires and don't care how they do it . the dialogue is schmaltzy and unconvincing ; their hard sell techniques are sleazy and leave the characters soulless , and the 'homeboy' attitudes displayed by their after-work hijinks- of pub crawling , looking for fights and girls , leaves a lot to be desired . father and son had a tension between them that made for some melodramatic moments . but this is clearly a film about young people with unbridled energy who are clueless about how to live their lives without copying someone else's idea of what the good life is . and because they are so dull-witted and deliver lines without the gift of gab that a writer like david mamet presents his stars with , in his glengarry glen ross , the film lags in scope . but through the device of quick-paced editing , it appears to be moving to some sort of rapid resolution . its moral theme might be , if you get rich so fast , you must be ready to fall quickly . the characters here are just low-level white collar hustlers , the amoral garden variety kind , and their distasteful conduct and empty lives spark no interest . these are the kind of telemarketers that the american public has been inundated with over the recent years , with no end in sight . since the film doesn't humanize them , but allows them to be the monsters they really are , it is indeed a hard sell to find this film as anything but a look at the ugly side of outlaw capitalism . the movie has a lot of energy and zeroes in on an unhealthy segment of the population whose lure for working is solely for material things , such as fancy cars , not giving a hoot how ethical their job is . its company name j . t . in the background hip-hop music blares away . this is a film geared for young people , its target audience is probably made up of those who liked last year's overrated nihilistic fight club . a romance is brought into the film as another subplot , but is never fully developed to be anything but superficial . she shuns greg and goes for his underling seth , in a romance that has about as much spark in it as a firecracker that fizzles out in your hand . why this interracial romance develops and how it suddenly ends , doesn't amount to hill or beans . the best thing about the film was the performance of vin diesel as chris , a seasoned hustler of stocks and bitter rival of greg's . there is a certain power in his character , a believability about what he is doing there that seemed more intense than seth's fall and redemption . the film would have been better off focusing in on his story ; it would have remained true to its cynical premise about the youth it features . this story is at best , about a theme that was done before in films such as " wall street " and " tin men , " but this time with even more cynicism and more of an edge to it . the picture itself is a hustle , trying to sell you something by pretending it has something to say , if you hold onto to its premise without selling it short . underneath the closeness of the boys in the boiler room , there are some underlying problems in their relationships besides the usual ones of competiveness . and chris shoots back , " why don't you go make me a latke , dreidel boy ? " interestingly enough , the only one in the firm that seth trusts is chris , and this trust is rewarded in a contrived scene in the end , as the film tries to dig itself out of the amoral hole it dug for itself . the operative word in this film is contrived . 
1	the script uses the actual diary of one of the girls to narrate the show . what is right with this movie is the true story and the excellent performances by both of the lead actresses . lynskey reminded me a lot of the actress from angel at my table which was also set in new zealand . the romance between the two girls is quite convincing and well done . sad to say that the writer and director , peter jackson , could not decide what kind of movie he wanted to make so he made three . this works very well . it could have easily been a * * * 1/2 movie if he had stuck to that . i guess he decided that would not sell enough tickets . the movie tries to be a comedy as well - a sort of true story harold and maude . this works for some people . the woman in front of me spend almost the entire movie in one belly laugh after another . just having lynskey smile or frown would set her off . i found it funny a few times , but as a comedy it was a * show . the saddest part was that they spent a lot of money on special effects and made a significant part of the movie in a sword and sorcery show ala willow or excalibur . this was an abysmal failure for which i would have given it no stars at all . so they had some great material and they blew it ! i give heavenly creatures * * and do not recommend it . it runs too long at 1 : 38 . it is correctly rated r , but i think older teens could see it if for some reason they so desired . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	in an era of rapid technological change , the film industry stands out as a veritable dinosaur . so it is all the more noteworthy when a film like disney's dinosaur makes such a stunning visual achievement through radical blending of technologies . combining some of the most sophisticated computer-generated animation that you've ever seen with ( digitally enhanced ) live-action backgrounds , the ground-breaking film becomes a dinosaur documentary on steroids . it is the sort of picture that has you sitting there going , " wow ! " what are sorely absent , however , are pixar and their band of merry men to craft a script that can hold your attention . the result is a story that is a pale imitation of the land before time , which had more endearing characters and more effective humor . still , it's not that the script bombs , but that it fizzles . there are several nice sections of dialog , and some imaginative characterizations . but when a disney film leaves one nostalgic for the land before time , that's not a good sign . the way to approach dinosaur , however , isn't to ponder how good it could and should have been , but to enjoy what it does best , which is to recreate the world of the dinosaurs toward the end of their reign on earth . best of all is the realism shown in the skin of the dinosaurs , which has a texture so life-life , that you'll swear they've located real dinosaur flesh and digitally imposed it on computer generated wire-frames . this magic extends to all of the textures including those of the dinosaur's comical sidekicks , a group of lemurs , whose fur can be seen convincingly blowing in the breeze as the lemurs leap from tree to tree . " things like that eat things like us for snacks , " he admonishes them . " this monster's got no teeth , " zini points out . scariest of all are some chillingly realistic carnotaurs , which look like t-rexs , who roar a lot and eat everything in sight . this brings us to the issue of the film's rating . disney's animated motion pictures are almost always rated g . in order to make the movie as authentic as possible , disney allowed the filmmakers to bring dinosaurs in at a pg rating . but it is an extremely intense pg that has significant potential to scare little ones . these carnotaurs would have been happy to nosh on little humans , something that the small fry will easily be able to imagine . and when the meteors hit , it may look like the end of the world to impressionable youngsters . the rest of the storyline follows a formula so cast in stone that it could have been written by a computer . maybe it was . the movie's press kit proudly brags about what a technical tour de force it is . and rightly so . since software designers use the word " dinosaur " as a derogatory term , the irony of this claim has a delicious charm to it . although one can argue whether knowing the amount of code means anything , it did bring to mind the technical genius that went into the production of dinosaur . even if the film has shortcomings , its visuals are nothing short of incredible . it is rated pg for intense images and would be fine for kids around 8 and up . parents with kids who frighten easily should carefully consider whether their children are ready for this picture . my son jeffrey , age 11 , loved the movie , giving it a full * * * * . he particularly liked the computer generated animation . he said that he enjoyed it when the movie scared him a little bit . 
0	screenplay : daniel taplitz . director : daniel taplitz . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 87 minutes . i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world . and i wish that film-makers would use commandments as a blueprint on how _not_ to do it . taplitz isn't interested in treating seth's tragedies as genuinely tragic , making it impossible to sympathize with him . composer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds , turning seth's sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark ; quinn's performance as seth is all wild-eyed fervor without any genuine pain . the result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a high-concept movie plot . it's not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth . only courteney cox strikes a note of reality in a solid performance ; she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve . by the time seth makes a singularly biblical reappearance late in the film , it has become clear that taplitz is aiming for a fantastical fable which makes no connection with real human experience . commandments is a bad comedy which could have been a decent drama if daniel taplitz had had the guts to take faith -- and the loss thereof -- at all seriously . 
1	woody allen plays a vintage woody allen character resurrected from his films of old in small time crooks , a movie which he also wrote and directed . it is the starring role in the type of silly comedies that first made him famous . this one isn't in the same league as the classic woody comedies , which it mimics , but it is a pleasant little movie that's as easy to listen to as woody's signature jazz scoring . his script proves better than its delivery perhaps because the actors seem a bit tired , like vaudevillians who've done the same routine so often that they've lost their edge . " what would you say if i told you that you were married to a very brilliant man ? " " i'd say , i'd have to be a bigamist ! " neither of them excels in brains or class . and their outlandish outfits match the decor perfectly . " my idea of a good time is not opera and ruins , " says ray . " i get enough sleep at home . " he just wants people to laugh at his jokes . they just stare at him without laughing or even blinking an eye . eventually the movie ends as much because it just runs out of steam as because the plot has reached its predictable conclusion . although it has a few nice laughs , the movie never rises above forgettable fluff . if you want to see the real thing , rather than this pale imitation , just rent some of woody's early pictures and savor what he once was capable of creating . it is rated pg for mild language and innuendo and would be acceptable for kids around 8 and up . 
2	nicholas ray's exotic pyschological and neurotic western , in which he covers his usual outsider theme but in a western that doesn't feel like any other . it feels as if freud wrote the script and everyone's sexual motivations were constantly being psychoanalyzed . it was almost as if the film was a parody of a western , humorously examining what a man and a woman are supposed to be like , while playing games with the western conventions . it also could be thought of as a political allegory , a critical reaction to the witchhunt of mccarthyism taking place at the time , of the senator's self-righteous attacks on those he didn't like and for going after others for reasons of guilt by association . nicholas ray was so enamored with mercedes' manic performance , he called it straight " sulphuric acid . " the film opens in stunningly beautiful trucolor , as johnny guitar is crossing the mountainous terrain and the mesas , and the pastel colors of that scenery comes across as particularly striking . the mannerisms of all concerned are weird , to say the least , especially for a western film . no western has ever had female leads with twisted personalities such as in this one and a psychopathic drifter as its sort of reluctant hero . i think i saw that heroic bit on one of those roy rogers movies , so this is a western after all ! there was a lot in this western to digest , and most of it is in its relentless use of sexual symbolism . 
2	cartoons were originally just the opening act to whet the audience's appetite for the cinematic main course . walt disney changed all of that in 1937 with the first feature-length animated movie , snow white and the seven dwarfs . since then what brings people into the theaters , rather than the now ubiquitous video rental emporiums , has changed dramatically . the movies that make money these days rely heavily on star power or special effects , frequently both . young kids are seen less and less at the multiplex because studios are ignoring them . is it that fewer kids are coming and therefore the studio's wise marketeers are cutting back on kids' movies to match the decrease in demand ? yet some animated movies have been successful and a few , such as the lion king , have been incredibly lucrative . so what does it take to make a winning movie with cartoon characters ? although there is no sure and certain recipe , aside from having a disney logo , some of the ingredients include color , images , music , humor , and a compelling story . its popularity comes from a combination of all of the above ingredients , but one part stands head and shoulders above the rest -- the images , which are worthy of a master painter . this film is so beautiful that , if the sound system were to go out , you would have absolutely no reason to demand your money back . just watching the picture provides the vast majority of the enjoyment , which is not to say that the other parts have problems since they do not . although the songs are the film's weakest element , even some of them , especially " dancing bear " , are quite lovely . historians would be well advised to skip the picture for it plays fast and loose with the facts , but others will not care . this is a cartoon to entertain audiences , not an instructional video . ryan becomes the character rather than the other way around , unlike the genie in aladdin , for example , who became robin williams . if your girls are looking for a good role model , look no further . the twist is that anya may actually be anastasia . ( anastasia has a cute little dog named pooka , who , unlike most cartoon characters , does not get to talk . ) his hands fly off , his mouth falls down and he generally cannot keep himself together -- we've all had days like that . the memorable parts of anastasia are the visuals . although words cannot do them justice , let me mention a few of the best . oranges and reds dance across the screen as the heat of the flames makes the air undulate in front of the viewers . when the train crashes down into the canyon , it explodes in a fireball both realistic and gorgeous . the characters are all drawn with life-like delicacy . it is easy to go on , but the film is more to be seen than discussed . it is rated g and would be fine for the whole family . there is some potential that the littlest munchkins might be scared by rasputin , but i saw no evidence of it in our packed theater . my son jeffrey , age 8 , said he thought the show was " pretty good " and that he liked the funny doggie ( pooka ) the best . a surprised and wide-eyed dimitri remarks , " that will work . " 
2	united states , 1995 release date : beginning 6/96 ( limited ) running length : 1 : 45 mpaa classification : no mpaa rating ( profanity , mature themes ) theatrical aspect ratio : 1 . 85 : 1 the characters of james mangold's debut feature , heavy , are the flotsam and jetsam of life -- men and women left scattered and forgotten on the beach of pete and dolly's restaurant , a hudson valley roadhouse where a smile is just about the last thing anyone expects to see . no one here is happy or well-adjusted . each character has problems , some of which we're told very little about , but the common denominator is that they all view life as something to be endured rather than experienced . life-weary and looking for a little affection , delores drifts from day-to-day , not seeming to care what comes next . nevertheless , his feelings for callie , which are clearly not reciprocated on the same level , will seemingly lead to inevitable heartbreak . where forrest gump was the fantasy , heavy is the reality . victor is a gump-like character -- slow-witted and likable . however , while robert zemeckis' 1994 blockbuster gave us a triumphant fairy tale , heavy gives us a near-tragedy . writer/director mangold never compromises the integrity of his painfully-intense script . there isn't one crowd-pleasing moment in the entire movie , except perhaps the last scene , which offers a flicker of hope . much of heavy is about communication , or , more appropriately , the lack thereof . at times , their inability to break through these barriers is maddeningly frustrating -- much as it was in 1992's un coeur en hiver , the french film about a man who suppresses all of his feelings . in heavy , we sense that victor would like to express himself , except he either doesn't know how or is so insecure about himself that the fear of rejection keeps him quiet . dialogue is sparse in heavy , so it's left up to the actors to form and develop their characters with mannerisms and facial expressions instead of scripted lines . considering that the cast is not made up of " great " names , this is a daring move by mangold . deborah harry is also good , giving us the kind of waitress who would have made frankie and johnny a memorable movie . and shelley winters is refreshingly low-key . heavy is not the kind of film to view when you're looking for something upbeat . it's too real , and , as a result , potentially too painful . on the way out of the theater , i heard someone remark , " why did i just sit through that film ? i've lived that story , and i don't need to be put through it again ! " mangold captures the nuances of life perfectly , and , by never cheapening his vision through facile resolutions , he fashions a memorable cinematic portrait . ultimately , heavy's considerable weight has little to do with what the scale says when victor steps onto it . 
2	this is a steven spielberg dreamworks project film . her unattentive folks don't even realize what is eating at her , that she wants an unneeded breast enlargement , and that she lacks self-esteem , thinking of herself as being unattractive . ricky and lester will share this same vision of life , as this becomes the film's mantra , reinforced several times throughout the film : that redemption can be gotten through love . this mantra will also be repeated at the end of the film , before the credits are shown . the viewer is told by lester , from the other world : that if you don't share the film's piercing vision of what really matters , someday you will . the lesson to be learnt is , that love is the only thing that can't be completely taken away from people ; it remains behind everything that is . this alan ball script , his debut assignment in films , is bristling with comedy and hard lessons to learn about life for these unfulfilled characters . if normalcy is the thing that the families are striving for , even if that is quickly seen as a sham , then what the director brilliantly does , is shoot down any hope for his characters ever being normal , even those who might think that they are normal . so what are they striving for , if not normalcy ? what results is a darkly satirical story that was equisitively directed . it makes sound points about the fallacy of normalcy and the necessity of nonconformity , and that its barbs about suburbia are on target . but the film succeeds , and in some regards is brilliant , not because some of the flawed characters see the light of day at last and might possibly reform , but because the acting was grand by everyone , and spacey was more than grand , his was a tour-de-force performance . he has the ability to squeeze humor out of a stone and turn frightening at the drop of a dish . he's that good of an actor to carry this film , even as he is supported by a terrific cast , he still stands out as the star . bening is his perfect foil , with a special flare for comedy , but still , through no fault of hers , is a cardboard villain , with no room to grow . mena is in an exploitive role , one that calls for an obligatory porn shot of her breasts ; but she is delicious and appealing , and brings more to the part than can be expected , even crying out for sympathy by the film's end . thora , a 17-year-old veteran actress , even at that tender age , played a twisted and sullen figure , but nevertheless came off as a sympathetic figure , giving a soulful performance , in a role that reminded many people of one that christina ricci would play , but not necessarily play better . cooper did a fine job as a homophobic and a closet homosexual , but his role as a villain was also too one-dimensional to give his character a more introspective edge to it , even if his performance was first-class . so why did i just like the film very much but not love it ? i think it is because , as entertaining as this film was , something just didn't smell right about these roses ; everything discovered seemed to be only something that is surface ; there was no real revolution of character going on . i think there were too many contradictions in the lives of lester , ricky , and jane to believe that they found what they were looking for , even if , the film implies that is just what they did do . the satire also became mean-spirited , at this point , as i took exception to some of the jokes plied from these scenes , as they seemed to be mocking those who take such jobs , by implying those jobs are just for losers . his character was actually the most interesting one in the film , since he saw things the others couldn't see , yet i suspect there is something deeply wrong with a teenager who has to find love by being a voyeur and material success by being a drug dealer , no matter how it is explained away . when you think about what the film had to say and distance yourself from all the fine performances and the splendid cinematography that the 70-ish-year-old master of his craft , conrad l . hall , gave us , who is an expert on lighting techniques , and you step away from the sharp wit found in alan ball's dazzling script-- what you are left wondering about , is how shallow it all is , in a film that has a bite to its satire but not enough of a bite to dig into the characters other than what is seen on the surface . in the end , this is primarily a hollywood type of film and all the hype about how daring and nonconventional this film is , should be dismissed as nothing but hype . yet it is a captivating film , one that had its moments of grandeur , and all-in-all , i really was absorbed in it , and somehow liked the film more than i probably should have . 
0	a 'b' movie political thriller , that was shrewd enough to get newsreel footage of the royal family and the cabinet attending the opening of parliament into its closing action scenes . the weak script and uninspiring dialogue , is compensated for by the crisp action sequences and fast pacing of the story . the revengeful hennessy has a one-track mind , never revealing anything about his character or why he should snap in this way and come up with such a ludicrous scheme , as the one he has hatched . this is one of those films that doesn't add up if you think about it . the film hopes to get by because of the taut acting jobs of its lead characters and by the semi-documentary glossy black-and-white look its color tinted film has , giving it a natural and gritty feel . but the film's ending has so many holes in its planning , that the film seems incredulous and the points it make seem dull , and its suspense is not that nerve wracking either , since you can almost bet your house that the filmmakers are not going to have the loony hennessy blow up parliament . the best things one can say about the film , was that the acting wasn't bad and it was watchable even if it was not a very believable story . 
1	malice is a well-crafted , intelligently-scripted thriller that is perhaps a bit too slick to be considered film noire , but is nevertheless hitchcockian in intent . the movie breaks free of the mold that so many of its genre have lately fallen into , that of a seemingly-helpful friend/neighbor/nanny/police officer/whatever turning out to be a wacko . malice has a little more class than that . there are quite a few twists and turns in the plot , some of which aren't that difficult to figure out , but a few that are likely to take the viewer unawares . make no mistake : the intent of this movie is to surprise the audience , and it succeeds fairly well at that . while it's true that in the aftermath of malice , careful thought will reveal some logical flaws in the script , these aren't nearly as noticeable during the action . the plot has some structural problems resulting from trying to do a bit too much for the running time . there are also several scenes and plot threads that , while interesting , ultimately have nothing to do with the story . the inclusion of these is more odd than frustrating , however . the unusual genesis of the script might have something to do with the irrelevance of some of what appears . this was before a few good men had made the transition from play to film . so , although the shooting script came from sorkin's pen , it included numerous elements of both his own and frank's versions . considering the number of cooks involved in this broth , it's amazing that the final product is so polished . scott frank's involvement immediately makes one think of dead again , but this movie is closer to shattered in execution--the plot twists aren't nearly as well-camouflaged as in the kenneth branagh-directed thriller . that is only one of a few standout scenes , all but one of which feature baldwin . the acting is uniformly good , with appearances by anne bancroft ( who is wonderful ) and george c . scott ( who is solid , but nothing to write home about ) . baldwin loves this kind of role , and nicole kidman shows that she's capable of being more than tom cruise's on- and off-screen love interest . bill pullman is the weakest of the trio , but he gets better as the film progresses . jerry goldsmith turns in a surprisingly spare score , more reminiscent of bernard hermann's hitchcock material than his own overblown basic instinct music . it's a pleasure not to be bombarded by blasts of music any time something dramatic is about to happen . goldsmith deserves credit for this . there are movies that demand loud , bombastic themes , but this is not one of them , and the composer recognized this . occasionally there's a diamond in the rough like dead again , but mostly these films are dreary , predictable , and utterly uninteresting--entirely the opposite of what the word " thriller " means . while malice won't win any awards , it's a cut above the average . yes , there are hollywood conventions in it , but the movie also keeps the intelligent viewer in mind . while the final result is something of a curious mixture , it's ultimately one that provides a source of entertainment .

( not exactly a list like the one from the player , is it ? ) for movie-after-movie , leslie nielsen has milked this same personality , and it's starting to wear very thin . as affable as the actor is , there's just nothing left in this caricature . however , while spy hard might have worked better with , say , roger moore in the title role ( his 007 was a parody towards the end , anyway ) , nielsen's performance is only a small part of a massively-flawed production . hard is the operative word here , because , even at just eighty-one minutes , this movie is unbelievably difficult to sit through . 
0	jekyll and mr . a fair indication of the quality of dr . jekyll and ms . hyde can be gained by looking at its release date : labor day weekend--where bad movies go to die . or sherilyn fenn's boxing helena ? jekyll and ms . jekyll and mr . jekyll and mr . filled with double-entendres and other crude humor , the movie is aimed even lower than at the dumb and dumber audience . the premise of a man taking a potion and turning into a woman is tacky enough to begin with , but , in this case , very little of the shallow comic potential is translated into laughs . a movie this dumb needs a fair share of successful comedy to make it worth anyone's viewing time . jekyll and ms . hyde , the guffaws are far apart . there are some chuckles--including a hilarious cameo with actor/writer robert wuhl--but hardly enough to make this motion picture worth the price of admission . on top of that , the acting is uneven . although tim daly is suitably likable , sean young plays a surprisingly weak femme fatale . harvey fierstein and steven tobolowsky , as richard's bosses at a perfume manufacturing company , have a few amusing scenes , but lysette anthony gives too serious a performance as the doctor's fiancee . jekyll and ms . hyde is late-night cable tv fare . it's the kind of movie someone might willingly pause for in post-midnight channel surfing , but not the sort worth paying for . it's a poor execution of a bad take on a stale premise . the idea was interesting when stevenson's book was first published , but , after so many adaptations and rip-offs , it has gotten as flat as tim daly's deflated chest . 
1	i have no objection to violence and gore in the movies -- even extreme violence and gore -- as long as it serves a purpose ( see goodfellas , pulp fiction , and even scream for examples ) . in nightwatch , however , the most explicit and extreme instances of bloodletting are designed exclusively to titillate or horrify , depending on the viewer's tolerance and point-of-view . apparently , director ole bornedal ( remaking his own 1994 danish hit , nattevagten ) recognized how thin and contrived his script was , and attempted to plug the holes with something warm , wet , and sticky . as either a slasher/horror flick or a murder mystery/thriller , nightwatch is a failure . the film's distribution history -- or lack thereof -- is a tip-off that something is wrong . anyone hoping for some quality entertainment will realize that this is not a good sign . most of the action , such as it is , takes place within a morgue , and bornedal makes it a suitably creepy place , with long , silent corridors , flickering fluorescent lights , and dancing shadows . atmosphere is nightwatch's strongest asset . sadly , it's all downhill from there as the movie devolves into something that is simultaneously familiar and ridiculous . aside from the atmosphere , which gradually dissipates as the plot takes off , nightwatch doesn't have much to offer . bornedal appears to be disregarding every aspect of police procedure and forensic technology by allowing something so blatantly outrageous to seem even vaguely possible . hitchcock's movies often had plot holes , but never were they this obvious to viewers while the film was in progress ( most were unearthed during post-screening discussions ) . then there's the dialogue which , in trying to be profound , frequently ends up sounding silly . we get lines like this one : " if it can't be experienced , it's just meaningless chaos . " the acting is less-than-inspired . ewan mcgregor ( sporting a hit- and-miss american accent ) , who has become a sought-after commodity following his outing in trainspotting ( so much so that george lucas pegged him to play obi-wan kenobi in the new star wars film ) , has a few effective scenes , but , for the most part , he's bland . josh brolin is over-the-top , but i suppose that's the intention . and nick nolte gives what is likely his worst performance since another 48 hours . my patience for dumb thrillers , where the audience is always about ten steps ahead of the characters , is wearing very thin . if not for bornedal's stylish approach to the material and a couple of effectively chilling sequences , nightwatch would have been a complete waste of time and effort . as it is , it's still not worth more than an unenthusiastic video recommendation , which is the medium in which most interested viewers will end up seeing it , since its box office life is likely to be deservedly short .

1	with can't hardly wait , i suppose first time directors deborah kaplan and harry elfont ( whose previous credits include writing the script for a very brady sequel ) were trying to recapture the mood of a john hughes '80s teen comedy . can't hardly wait is a painfully predictable account of that ultimate teenage bacchanalia -- the post-graduation party . yet , instead of bringing intriguing characters with real problems and interesting dialogue to the bash , kaplan and elfont take the lazy approach of pulling generic stereotypes off the shelf and throwing them into a formulaic plot that doesn't offer one genuine surprise or meaningful moment . can't hardly wait is awash in pointless subplots . depending on how one counts them , there are at least six or seven . some are given more screen time than others , but none has enough to flesh out the characters beyond two-dimensionality or to get us interested in their lives . the difference between a good movie with an ensemble cast and a bad one is how easily the protagonists and their individual pieces of the overall plot engage the viewer . instead of taking a few risks to win us over , can't hardly wait traverses the tediously safe route by stringing together a series of would-be " cute " scenes , slapstick humor ( drunks are always supposed to be funny , right ? ) , and trite " bonding " moments . what can't hardly wait offers are flat characters stuck in underdeveloped situations . of the film's dozen-or-so primary players , she's the only one who seems more like a real person than a caricature . as ably portrayed by lauren ambrose ( who previously appeared as one of kevin kline's students in in & out ) , denise is capable of engaging our sympathies . everyone else seems to exist for only one purpose -- to be at this party . it's virtually impossible to imagine anyone having any kind of life outside of these circumstances -- such shallow characters are obviously tailored to the needs of the script . for those who enjoy saccharine romances , the interaction between preston and amanda offers some limited possibilities . you'd have to be hopelessly na ? ve not to realize how it's all going to turn out , but the two actors , ethan embry ( that thing you do ! ) and jennifer love hewitt ( i know what you did last summer ) , are so likable that it's hard not to have at least a minor rooting interest in their pairing . seeing the inevitable resolution is one of the few reasons to stay for the duration of can't hardly wait's one-hundred minute running length . just like the teen movies of the '80s , can't hardly wait is targeting the 13-to-18 year-old group by offering popular actors like embry and love hewitt , wall-to-wall pop music ( often , the film seems like nothing more than an excuse to sell a soundtrack ) , and ample portions of booze and sex ( although the pg-13 rating limits the latter ) . it's all marketing -- collect enough appealing snippets for a 30-second tv commercial , and maybe the kids will come . with effectively-developed characters , decent dialogue , and something resembling a compelling plot , this approach can lead to a satisfying movie-going experience . sadly , those characteristics are taking a vacation in can't hardly wait . whatever shallow charm the film offers wears off fast as we realize that it's not funny , endearing , dramatically sound , or going anywhere that we haven't been before . as a result , the title seems unexpectedly appropriate , as it accurately summed up my feelings about sitting in the theater and anticipating the arrival of the end credits -- i couldn't hardly wait . " my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . " -- david puttnam 
1	a funny spoof on hollywood , scripted by and starring steve martin . " we've got to get a crew , and i want the best damn crew we can afford !

' this movie about making a movie has the hollywood phony la-la scene down pat and under frank oz's sharp direction , the film gets all the laughs it can from its very funny satirical premise . martin and murphy were never funnier , and the supporting cast adds just the right ingredients to the comedy presentation . even though most of the film does work , some of the comedy routines became tiresome as the film progressed but not enough to spoil the lighthearted fun . 
0	there is no doubt in my mind that david duchovny can be a movie star . his often under-appreciated work on " the x-files " has demonstrated both dramatic chops and a wry sense of humor , as well as the requisite physicality for action . duchovny has the looks , the smarts and the range on the big screen to go places most fellow tv alums never go . it's also clear that he knows how to pick interesting scripts . to a resume which already includes unconventional fare like kalifornia and the rapture , duchovny adds mark haskell smith's playing god . smith's script does about all you could ask a script to do , delivering some well-developed characters and smart dialogue ( okay , there are a couple of howlers ) in service of that premise . duchovny selected a nice piece of material to work with , but playing god shows that an actor can't choose most of the things which go into the making of a good film . it has the feel of a film which should have been much better , but turned out inconsistent and sloppy under the first-time direction of andy wilson ( of the popular cable mystery series " cracker " ) . there are times when wilson tries so hard to create his gritty thriller atmosphere -- all distorted imagery , slow motion and awkward cross-cutting -- that the narrative begins to get lost . he's going for the right mood , but with the wrong methods . duchovny also had no control over the performances of his cast-mates , though from all appearances , neither did the director . his performance might have been even more effective if a dozen other supporting players weren't making unhinged seem so unnecessary . the general tone of the performances makes duchovny stand out like buster keaton in a three stooges short . his deadpan demeanor begins to seem like a reaction to a bunch of nutcase actors let loose on the screen , rather than the appropriate personality for his redemption-hungry character . in fact , duchovny is too " together " most of the time ; rock bottom doesn't look all that bad if that's where he's supposed to be when we meet him . then again , it's hard to say whether that particular character choice was duchovny's to make . you can see his star quality in playing god , but you can also see that picking a sharp script is no guarantee that an actor will be in a sharply-made film . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
0	screenplay : george miller , judy morris and mark lamprell . director : george miller . running time : 95 minutes . like a classic storybook tale , 1995's babe was set no-where and no-when in particular . the singular world in which the rosy , glowing hoggett farm and its chattering menagerie existed added to the charm that made the original film a surprise hit and an oscar-nominee . babe : pig in the city takes that anywhere-ness a step farther . . . actually , a step too far . it's a cute gag the first time , but it also signals a not-so-subtle shift in tone from babe . the setting is no longer anywhere , but everywhere ; the story isn't just a fantasy where anything could happen , but one where the film-makers try to make everything happen . babe : pig in the city is so full of plots and sub-plots that saving the hoggett farm practically becomes an afterthought , with a resolution so silly it almost seems a waste of time . you might suspect that a pace that frantic would be a sop to younger viewers , but it's hard to imagine george miller ( who produced the original and also directs here ) had kids in mind making this film . a catastrophic performance by a low-rent circus ( featuring mickey rooney in a weird cameo as a clown of indeterminate personality ) turns into a moody and murky slow-motion sequence like something out of platoon ; later , a dog with a bad heart has a near-death experience with pastoral visions . babe certainly had a few dark moments , but nothing like the consistently creepy feel of pig in the city . miller may have been playing to the kiddies when mrs . hoggett goes bouncing around a reception hall in inflatable pants , but not when a dog insults a cat with an epithet that could be interpreted as quite vulgar . ironically , that strangely mature tone introduces the film's only truly compelling element , a melancholy performing orangutan named thelonious ( voice of james cosmo ) . he's a mysterious presence who can't seem to bear the idea that he's not human , and both the animal and vocal performances are wonderfully sympathetic . i sat just a bit forward in my seat every time thelonious appeared , gradually realizing that this one character also served to point out how bland the rest of the characters are in babe : pig in the city . there are too many animals milling about to care about any of them all that much ; even the little pig himself seems to have been sapped of personality . the easy rapport between babe and farmer hoggett ( relegated here to little more than a glorified cameo ) is sorely missed . then again , a whole lot of things from babe are sorely missed . it's a nice change of pace to find a sequel that doesn't merely try to remake the original , but babe : pig in the city lack any of the original's endearing gentle spirit . it's so hyped-up and busy , it's almost as though john hughes got hold of our sweet little pig and tossed him into a home alone sequel . this is one major holiday disappointment , a storybook tale that should have quit with its original happy ending . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " .

1	screenplay : anne rice . and both were the subject of intense pre-release scrutiny as a result of off-beat casting decisions . however , the most relevant--and unfortunate--similarity between the two is what ends up on the screen . interview with the vampire is a spectacularly executed production , perhaps more consistent in its tone than frankenstein , but it also lacks that film's high points ; it's simply too plot-heavy , and ends up feeling extremely rushed . first , to the single most pressing question to anyone familiar with anne rice's novel : is tom cruise an acceptable lestat ? the answer is , sometimes . there are moments , and not isolated ones , where cruise is positively fiendish , more so than one could have any right to hope . he has said in interviews that he grew to hate playing the depressive vampire , and that fact is sadly evident in his performance , a dazed and lackluster turn . she becomes the tortured soul whose plight truly connects with the audience in a way that louis's should have , but never does . of course , this is one of the dangers inherent in doing a big hollywood adaptation of what is essentially an interior monologue . director neil jordan has filmed the story beautifully , busing philippe rousselot's cinematography to perfection , and scenes like the theater of vampires production are nearly ideal translations from the novel . the production design is magnificent , and elliot goldenthal's score is a great mood setter . it looks so good that occasionally i could overlook the fact that in their rush to pack as much plot as possible into two hours , jordan and rice had severely skimped on their characters' motivations . this is not to say that there haven't been some significant improvements made from the novel , particularly adding some much-needed black humor . but for interview with the vampire to work as anything besides simply spectacle , louis had to becomes something besides a pouting immortal , and lestat had to be something more than a sporadically zany eternal adolescent . interview with the vampire ends up positively gorgeous , and extremely hollow .

" it's a sexy french romp into familiar territory , with characters who don't tell us much about what's inside them . is able to remain pleasantly atmospheric until the nonsensical melodramatic climax , when its charmed life runs out of charm . there's nothing new uncovered about relationships here , in fact the main relationship is more absurd than real . but nathalie baye is able to carry off this fantasy romance story further than it deserved to go , and for that alone it's worth a look . 
1	yes . a war zone can be fun for restless teens with hot blood and a passion for mischief . this is a hearfelt film about his coming-of-age during that strife . the 36-year-old filmmaker studied at ucla and was the cameraman for quentin tarantino's pulp fiction and reservoir dogs . but , as riad says , this is our home , there is no other place i would feel comfortable fitting in . the film is not plot oriented , it relies on a bunch of episodic incidents to take place before tarek gets it through his clownish skull and smirking face that this city has changed and won't be the same again . we get a feel for what the director lived through as the friendly tarek is shown relating to his neighbors . the director also presents us with a flavor of the slang language used by the locals , with expressions such as : " you're shish-kabobing me on a small flame ; " or " you drive like steve mcqueen ; " and , about a buxom woman omar says , " what a piece of lamb ! " the film was good at given us a realistic look at how one family looked at those troubled times , rather than for having anything political to say . we are not getting a history lesson here , but a grown man's look back at a period of eight years of his youthful life . the film did this in a rather ordinary way , so that there is nothing deeper to dig out of ziad doueiri's story . it seemed to be a story that the director had to tell , and he shared what he saw with an audience that more than likely only followed the long civil war in the news stories and had no idea how it looked first-hand . this was a film that had no pretenses about it ; it just told the story it knew . 
0	anyone who doesn't understand the meaning of the phrase " the triumph of style over substance " should take a look at deception , although i shudder at the thought of labelling this a triumph of anything . it's a very empty tale of treachery and lies that rarely makes sense and engages the audience's interest even less frequently . miramax films releases two sorts of movies : independent and/or foreign films which generally attract a select audience ( many of these are quite good ) , and pictures that have sat undistributed on the shelf for a while ( many of these are quite bad ) . deception is in the latter category , having been untouched since post-production was completed early this year . its quality is consistent with the sort of movie released on an " off " weekend with little publicity in a small number of theaters . one wonders why miramax bothered . the plot is a real hack job . it rarely makes any sense , and when it does , we almost wish it didn't . the foundation of the story--that baseball cards hold the secrets to john's clandestine fortune--is so contrived and difficult to accept that it undermines the rest of deception--not that there's much else to undermine . lovers of the thriller/mystery genre waiting for sneaky plot twists will be disappointed . deception's storyline is straight as an arrow , with no deviations from the expected . perhaps that's supposed to be the big surprise--that everything is played out predictably . somehow , i doubt it . there is an attempt at a love story between fergus and bessie , but it's easy to miss . neither character is well-developed and their scenes together lack chemistry or heat . macdowell and neeson have created non- entities , but they can hardly be blamed . with a script as thin as this one , it's impossible to see either of them trying for more than a paycheck . deception can boast one positive attribute : it has a number of pretty shots from different locales . filmed on-location in los angeles , veracruz , berlin , athens , and cairo , the movie occasionally seems more like a travelogue than a thriller , although that's as much due to the lack of suspense as the pretty shots of the egyptian pyramids . better films than this have been released direct-to-video . the only reason deception received a theatrical run is because of the relative high profile of its main performers . never fear , however--it won't be around for long . however , anyone unwittingly lured into this by the stylish print ad campaign promising an exciting , exotic thriller will quickly learn exactly what is meant by the title . 
2	writer and director james l . brooks , who has blessed us with several wonderful films including terms of endearment and one of my all time favorite movies , broadcast news , gives the world a present this christmas called as good as it gets . few movies live up to their title , but this romantic comedy is indeed just about as good as it gets . he will not walk on lines in the sidewalk , which makes strolling down busy manhattan sidewalks pretty tricky . walking on tiled floors is almost impossible , too hard to avoid the cracks . and if you think that this behavior is bizarre , wait until you see how he treats his fellow human beings . with a sneer he retorts , " i think of men , and i take away reason and accountability . " nicholson's performance would remain just a fascinating side-show were it not for the casting of helen hunt as carol connelly , the only waitress in new york who can tolerate melvin's behavior . " do you have any control over how creepy you can get ? " reportedly holly hunter was to have hunt's role but could not agree on an acceptable salary . as much as i admire hunter's talents , the other hh actress seems much better suited to the role of a struggling waitress . never did i think of hunt as an actress . as i've suggested before , the difference between a good film and a great one lies in how well it handles the small details . consider one believable and riotously funny sequence . another measure of an outstanding film is whether it can break certain motion picture axioms and get away with it . one certainly is that comedies , and most movies for that matter , should come in under two hours . although this one is over two and a quarter hours long , there simply is nothing to cut . i loved all of the characters and would have been happy to see the movie last another hour . if there is any justice in hollywood then nicholson , hunt and kinnear will all get academy award acting nominations as well as brooks and his co-writer mark andrus for the intelligent script and brooks for the dead-on directing . that melvin and carol , who could not be more dissimilar , will fall in love is obvious from the movie's setup , but that doesn't make watching it anything less than enthralling . in one of the movie's best scenes , carol forces a showdown . after a long pause , in which you have no idea how she will react to his strange reply , she reflects , " that's maybe the best compliment of my life . " as good as it gets runs 2 : 18 . it is rated pg-13 for strong language , mature themes , brief nudity and a beating and would be fine for kids around eleven and up . 
2	for those who think that foreign-language films must always be pretentious and lugubrious , combination platter provides a pointed counterexample . although this is not an entirely chinese movie ( it takes place in flushing , new york , and approximately forty percent of the dialogue is in english ) , the presence of frequent subtitles will argue otherwise as far as most casual movie-goers are concerned . most movies are designed as methods of escapism , opening windows on lifestyles and stories that , whether momentous or not , are generally unfamiliar to the bulk of the audience . once in a while , however , a film manages to capture the essence of a familiar reality , and its attention to detail can make viewing the commonplace a highly-entertaining experience . combination platter is such a motion picture . helped immeasurably by yoshifumi hosoya's 16 mm camerawork and filmed in a restaurant owned by the director's family , tony chan's motion picture seems almost like a documentary . his dialogue is earthy , his characters have the " feel " of real people , and his comedy is natural ( as opposed to the often-contrived and artificial humor of most films ) . granted , there aren't any scenes in combination platter that will cause audience members to roll in the aisles with laughter , but the movie's sardonic wit will provoke chuckles aplenty . ever wonder what it's like behind-the-scenes at a restaurant ? combination platter gives an uncompromisingly accurate view , broadening its scope beyond the daily grind at the szechuan inn to follow one of the characters , robert , home . his quest to find a wife could be ( and has been ) the premise for romantic comedies , but tony chan handles this situation much differently than a green card . by using a uncommon setting and not dwelling on the potentially-downbeat elements of the situation , mr . chan succeeds at this difficult task . one might wonder what could be so fascinating about spending eighty-odd minutes with the employees of a chinese restaurant ? fortunately , it doesn't take long for the script and actors to answer that question . combination platter is light entertainment , a motion picture " snack " of sorts . and speaking of food , it might be best to see this film on a full stomach , lest you may find yourself leaving the theater for the nearest establishment offering moo goo gai pan . 
1	the father is paternally played with a very sweet charm , by veteran actor , seymour cassel . this is an original and quirky story , but it also follows a long tradition of films that took similar routes ( ferris bueller's day off , the graduate ) , so what seems to be taking place and in what direction it is going and who max is , cannot be simply or absolutely stated , which is great in some ways but completely mind-blowing in other ways , as this somewhat cheesy story has more holes in it than swiss cheese , yet no matter how it seems to be served , it always seems to be a story that is tastefully done . max is not exactly a nerd , as he is pushy , being neither completely likable nor obnoxious , who propels himself into the rushmore scene by pursuing extra-curricular activities to such a degree that it reaches the point of absurdity , as he is involved in so many diverse activities , that it is a wonder he has time to even take off the preppy jacket he loves to wear around the campus . it is at rushmore where he is bursting with untold energy for adventure , entrepenureship , and romance . there are many twists to come into play as the story is disarmingly told , forcing us not too get too comfortable in what we expect to be a sane commentary of the going-ons here . these scenes were wickedly cruel to comprehend , as the story flipped over from comedy to psychological drama , and to a certain extent , a temporary suspension of belief . yet it was this facet of the story that was most novel and daring about the film , as it let the characters freely play out who they were without contrivance . therefore , even if you didn't particularly care about the way things were going , you were at least taken aback by seeing how everyone interacted with each other . blume retaliating by smashing the kid's bike . the young director's previous film , bottle rocket , was also written by him with owen wilson , it was also quirky but a bit less professionally done . both films show promise of better things to come . there are still patches to this story that need further developing and to be pruned along the edges before we can say we have things in order , but after saying that , i must say that this is still a first-rate film , with a lot of bite to it , depicting characters in a discrete way that allows them to be very real and formidable . this is bill murray's best role yet , and for newcomer , jason schwartzman , the son of actress talia shire , a role made for him in filmdom heaven . 
1	it is a darkly violent film that fails to be dramatically engaging , but has its brief moments of edification as it satisfactorily points out how each side harmed innocent citizens in their fight and what ultimately the union victory meant for the country . but the film could not present a coherent plot , as it seemed to shrivel up as the story dragged on after its colorful battle scenes . taking the southern side , the film found humor in the awkward situations presented and found beauty in the landscape photographed , and reasons in the southern cause which doomed them to failure . but many things about the film seemed to be perfunctory and more like a costume show where the soldiers were more interested in showing off the plumage on their cowboy hats than in giving a dramatic presentation . this explains a key weakness of the southern cause , according to the filmmaker , that the southern values are tradition-bound and part of a static culture . they have been spending their time having longwinded unnatural conversations that sound much like sermons , so sue lee's intrusion is more than welcome at this time . though this is a technically correct and serious movie and tries to cover a controversial topic in an intelligent way , yet the presentation of the story didn't seem to always jell . it was a dull film , the acting was misplaced , the story was too distant and the dialogue was stilted . it never got around to being an entertaining film , and it could never be perceived as just an informative film , because it could never quite spit out what it was trying to say . i also found tobey maguire's performance grimacing to take--this was the wrong part and film for him to go through his innocent contortions that he has done in all his previous films . 
0	bushwhacked wins the " best trailer for a bad movie " award of 1995 . with its clever sendup of sylvester stallone's cliffhanger , the theatrical preview promises a far more clever and innovative picture than it delivers . as was true of last year's winner , the naked gun 33 1/3 , this is an occasion when it's far better to see the trailer and skip the actual film . once the opening credits start rolling , it's all downhill . on the whole , bushwhacked is the kind of film i like to describe as " offensively inoffensive . " that is to say , it tries so hard to be heartwarming and likable that it ends up making the average viewer want to retch . dramatically , the movie has all the substance of vapor . but it's really supposed to be a comedy , right ? who cares if the characters act corny as long as there are some laughs to be had ? unfortunately , bushwhacked doesn't deliver there , either . this is easily one of the least funny movies of the year . if i chuckled once , it was a lot . the jokes are inane and juvenile , with a sad predictability that leeches any potential humor out of each and every one of them . using a somewhat less pathological version of his home alone personality , stern is suitably manic , but not especially appealing . there's an awkwardness about the character that distances him from the audience , and his budding relationship with the six children is never convincing . there's one curious paradox about bushwhacked . the film was apparently written for ( and , judging by script quality , quite possibly by ) children under the age of ten . the result is a motion picture without an audience . and , since no viewers equates to no money , this movie is likely to have a mercifully short theatrical run . for that , at least , we can be thankful to the mpaa . 
1	tunisia/france , 1990 u . s . availability : varies running length : 1 : 38 mpaa classification : no mpaa rating ( nudity , sexual themes , profanity ) theatrical aspect ratio : 1 . 33 : 1 cast : selim boughedir , mustapha adouani , rabia ben abdallah , mohammed driss , carolyn chelby director : ferid boughedir producers : ahmed baha attia , eliane stutterheim , and hassen daldoul screenplay : ferid boughedir cinematography : georges barsky music : anouar braham u . s . distributor : international film circuit in arabic with subtitles however , while the film contains a few memorable sequences , it's hardly worth the kind of intensive search that will be necessary to uncover the nearest screening . regardless of the culture in which a child grows up , adolescence is always a confusing and difficult phase of the maturation process . in the muslim lifestyle , where women's features are veiled and men assert themselves as the " superior gender " , the male's transition from boyhood to manhood is all the more difficult . his sense of isolation is profound . halfaouine is a coming-of-age story that , at its core , isn't much different from similar narratives set in the united states . it's natural that in a society where women display little skin in public that there is great curiosity about what lies under all the clothing . telling noura's story isn't the movie's lone objective . openly challenging religious traditions , the writer/director criticizes the cultural schism that exists between the sexes . halfaouine contains interesting material , but a combination of subpar acting and poorly-realized characters stains the fabric of the production . aside from noura , there isn't a well-scripted personality in this film , and lead performer selim boughedir is not a naturally gifted actor . he seems to have two expressions : a blank look and a silly grin . because of boughedir's limited range , noura comes across as emotionally stunted , which results in a picture that seems big on ideas but small on heart . halfaouine is worth a look because of its perspective of a different culture , not because it tells an engrossing tale . 
2	" well , jones , at least you haven't forgotten how to show a lady a good time ! " and steven spielberg in 1981 knew how to show an audience a good time with an old fashion kids' adventure yarn , raiders of the lost ark . think of it as a high quality version of one of the old movie serials that kids used to get every saturday at the theater before the double feature . ( too young to know what a movie serial was like ? check out my recent review of the 1949 serial batman and robin -- not to be confused with this summer's blockbuster by the same name . ) the plot of raiders of the lost ark is utter balderdash . it makes as much sense as most kids' stories , and this one is so brilliantly and engrossingly executed , who cares how ridiculous it is ? ( my wife and i were once chased in austria by a boulder the size of the one from the famous scene in the film . so even the seemingly ludicrous can sometimes be true . ) with his rugged good looks and his signature outfit of big hat , leather jacket and bull whip , indy is a picture perfect action hero . the film must have provided gainful employment for scores and scores of stunt actors as action sequences come in increasing intensity as the show progresses . allen has a charming toughness that can be strong and sexy at the same time . in more recent times linda fiorentino has demonstrated some of these same macho but alluring qualities , and she too has had trouble breaking through into significant stardom . the film's other roles are less important , and only paul freeman , as the too milquetoast villain rene belloq , gives a disappointingly bland performance . john williams's rousing but playful music and the imaginative script by big chill writer lawrence kasdan , based on a story by george lucas and philip kaufman , combine to make a fun romp . a roller coaster of a film , it loves to play tricks on its audience . the cinematography of stone images filmed in warm blues and browns is punctuated by bright flashes of lightning representing the wrath of god . the cataclysmic ending descends too far into the realm of an overstaged horror show but is effective nevertheless . actually , saturday movie serials were never this good , but we'd like to believe they were . it was rated pg since i think there was no pg-13 at the time . today , a show with this much violence would be firmly in the pg-13 category . depending on how well they handle scary scenes like snakes crawling through skeletons , kids as young as 7 may be able to handle the film . my son jeffrey , age 8 , thought the movie was " good but pretty bloody , " and he wished there would have been less blood . i strongly recommend this adventure to you and give it a full * * * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . review written on : august 21 , 1997 
1	it's the era of e-mail , call waiting , answering machines , and cellular phones -- a time when impersonal communication has replaced interpersonal communication . at least that's how hal salwen presents things in denise calls up , and , for a certain segment of the population , salwen's scenario doesn't exaggerate much . if talking on the telephone is a weak surrogate for real human contact , then the men and women of denise calls up are seriously deprived . none of them ever congregate . whole relationships begin , climax , and end without either of the parties ever knowing what the other looks like . one of the problems with denise calls up is that it takes its excesses to excess . as intriguing as the premise is , i'm not sure it can support a feature-length movie ( even one as short as eighty minutes ) , and the second half of denise calls up ( with the exception of a riotous conference call ) is far less fresh than the first half . in addition , salwen's presentation is often cynical , sometimes bordering on cruel , and this attitude makes it difficult for viewers to care about the characters . the last scene rings hollow because the people involved don't mean that much to us . on the other hand , there's no doubt that salwen conveys his message . denise calls up isn't a vacuous comedy -- it has something to say , and the humor , some of which is quite funny , represents salwen's method of preaching . special mention should also be made of editor gary sharfin's work . denise calls up is light enough that it doesn't demand much range from the performers , all of whom are fine for their roles . the actors do their best to mold likable characters , but sometimes the script's glibness defeats them . so , while salwen has formed an interesting portrait of modern social interaction , his cynicism works against the movie's success . denise calls up might have been more effective if the writer/director had taken the time to create characters imbued with more than token traces of humanity . as things stand , everyone in this film is little more than a voice on the other end of the phone . 
2	i highly recommend this wonderful film that i saw recently at the press screening . sayles's pictures are always bursting with humanity . the scripts are intelligent and his films are rich with talented actors . he manages to find excellent although usually lessor known actors to play even the most minor roles . every member of the cast delivers a heartfelt performance . these groups are even more fragmented into some that are soldiers and others that are illegal aliens . they say " he is all hat and no cattle . " since charley has never been heard of in 40 years and since the skull is about that old , the narrative drive in the movie surrounds whether there could have been foul play back then . this mystery works really well , but it is not the best part of the picture nor the centerpiece . all of the acting by all of the wonderful characters we get to meet is the reason to see the film . the best performance is the reserved and lonely one by chris cooper as sam . as a one-dimensional bad guy , kris kristofferson is perfect . his philosophy is " it's not like there's a line between the good people and the bad people . it is not like you're one or the other . " sayles's script is naturally funny in a low key fashion . it is also full of poignancy . so many scenes are special , but two of my favorites are a slow dancing scene that is lovingly photographed by stuart dryburgh , and the other is of the abandoned drive-in theater where sam and pilar used to make out . as a native texan , i liked the way the accents were realistic . too often filmmakers overdo southern accents . certainly some locals have thick accents , but not all . perhaps my favorite technical aspect of the film is the editing , also by sayles . many scenes would move 40 years with just a pan and without any cuts . she again demonstrates her wide range of acting talent . lone star runs a full 2 : 15 , but given the time it spends delving into the lives of so many people and many racial communities , this feels short if anything . the film is rated r . there is a little sex , no nudity , and a little violence . i thought it should have been pg-13 . perhaps they used the f word a few times , and i missed it . at any rate , i think it would be fine for kids 10 and up . i strongly recommend this wonderful , insightful , and heartwarming film to you and award it * * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	i felt like i was being one-lined to a loving death in this elegant oscar wilde comedy/drama costume play turned movie , and i must confess , i enjoyed every bit of the intelligence and the wit and the frivality of it , as this tremendous ensemble cast fired away with a continuous volley of epigrams . it is a modern play , even though it is one that was written in the last century for an audience that was more or less reflective of the characters portrayed on stage . for the elite audience that attended the play , oscar wilde , after mocking the english nobility would , at least , leave them with a thinly disguised compliment , by telling them no one can be ideal . the film was put to screen by the manipulative wizardry of miramax ( shakespeare in love , the wings of the dove ) , who know from the success of some of their recent films quite well how to popularize an already popular literary work by broadening its emotional appeal . they gave the audiences what they wanted , a film that has a romantic heart in it and is not just hilariously flippant , and they should be commended for improving an imperfect but successful play . it rarely happens when a commercial venture turns out to critically improve a work of so called " art , " so when it does happen , it should be shouted from the highest mountain peaks . everything is thoroughly enjoyable and agreeable about this wonderfully delightful work of subtle wit and brilliant dialogue . rupert everett stands out as a sheer delight in a cast that is almost perfect ( julianne moore could have been a tad more sinister ) . everett's role is one that he relishes in , as he says of himself , " i love talking about nothing , it's the only thing i know anything about . " minnie driver is simply bubbling over with charm and wit to match his . their flirtations are one of dueling wits , with amusing lunges and enough double-entendres to get through any intellectual armor worn . there are so many witty phrases to revel in , but my favorite one is when lord goring says , " morality is only for those you don't like . " writer/director oliver parker ( othello ) has created a lighthearted film for all audiences who love the spoken word as if it were a treasure and who find the intrigues of high society to be invigorating . 
2	as directed by pretty woman's garry marshall and written by him and bob brunner , the other sister is two movies for the price of one , but only one is worth paying for . watching carla and daniel's beautiful but naturally awkward love affair and experiencing their coping with the world provides a wonderful movie-going experience that is alternately sweet , poignant , romantic and humorous . it does all this without ever falling into crass manipulation . unabashedly uplifting , the movie never stoops to exploiting the vulnerability of the leads' conditions . carla and daniel are as natural and believable as the supporting characters are plastic and clich ? d . nevertheless , they hit it off marvelously , and the quirky , romantic chemistry between them is a joy to behold . approaching it like a subject in school , they get " the new joy of sex " book and discuss which page numbers they like and which they don't . this is done so seriously and sweetly that it will have you doubling over with laughter . " i think it was madonna , " he replies seriously . ) the movie works best in its many innocent moments . the movie builds toward an emotional crescendo that will fill you with tears , many of joy . even if the last act is full of predictable scenes , they are so exuberant that they are delightful . every time the movie approaches the mawkish line , it manages to avoid stepping over it , mainly through the strength of the astonishing acting by lewis and ribisi . " i love you more than band music and more than cookie making , " daniel tells carla . that a movie could make a line like that sound genuine is all the testimony it needs . it is rated pg-13 for thematic elements involving sexuality and would be fine for kids around 12 and up . 
2	screenplay : wang hui-ling , james schamus and tsai kuo-jung , based on the book by wang du-lu . director : ang lee . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , sexual situations ) running time : 120 minutes . before delving into the reasons crouching tiger , hidden dragon isn't the unqualified masterpiece it's been touted as , let's revel in the reasons it's still a cinematic joy in a year of mostly leaden entertainments . in one of the film's many inspiring action sequences , a pair of adversaries square off in battle , employing a mystical fighting technique that allows its adherents to virtually defy gravity . it is the moment when it's easiest to appreciate crouching tiger , hidden dragon as a giddy exercise in pure cinema showmanship . over and over again , it lifts you out of the mundane world of a theater seat . it also drops you back into that seat a bit roughly every once in a while , but why quibble ? as directed by ang lee , the story is both mythologically basic and epic in scope . as solid as the narrative is in many ways , it would be ridiculous to argue that its critical and commercial success will be rooted in the story . crouching tiger , hidden dragon is first and foremost an adventure , one that turns choreographed action into pure film art . the action sequences combine the astonishing talents of fight choreographer yuen wo-ping ( the matrix ) with spectacular wire work to create moments that make you want to stand up and applaud . there's never even a sense of redundancy as the film progresses ; each sequence serves its own purpose , and offers wonderful variations on the clashing of metal , feet and fists , and escapes up sheer walls . it's pure indiana jones fun with an unexpected sense of consequence . it's also a martial arts-heavy film in which the thematic elements actually matter . while crouching tiger is certainly enjoyable as a distaff spin on the usually testosterone-soaked chop-socky genre , it's more than a feminist action flick . for an action-filled film , there's a lot going on above the neck . that's quite a load for an adventure film to carry , and occasionally it's not quite up to the task . yet as ambitious as it is , crouching tiger , hidden dragon never feels self-important . as beautifully crafted as it is ( notably peter pau's cinematography and tan dun's score ) , it never turns into a stagnant parade of lovely images . and as fanciful as its action sequences are , they never inspire eye-rolling . crouching tiger , hidden dragon isn't a masterpiece , but it doesn't have to be . there's pleasure enough in a film that doesn't make you feel stupid while it sends you soaring over the treetops . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " .

" unfortunately , as good as girl 6 is with the fine points , the larger brushstrokes are erratic . lee may have a keen sense of setting and dialogue , but his characterization is off . other than judy , no one has any depth , and even she isn't afforded much development . theresa randle ( sugar hill , malcolm x ) is okay in the role , but not a revelation . unlike exotica , which cut deeply into the motivations of those who work in and frequent strip clubs , this film is content to skim the surface of a similar industry . one scene of poignant disillusionment notwithstanding , judy's burgeoning addiction to the illusory aspects of her job is used more as a plot device than a means of exploring her psyche . the question is raised , although lee doesn't really probe it . while girl 6 is considerably more effective than showgirls at exploring the issue , there are times when this film seems like the proverbial triumph of style over substance . cinematographer malik hassan sayeed , who worked with lee on clockers , uses a battery of odd camera angles and experimental shots . most of these work on a purely visual level , but their attempts to telegraph emotional states are less successful . the highlights of the film are a trio of parody fantasies . give lee credit for using madonna and tarantino in roles they're capable of playing . if nothing else , girl 6's perspective of the industry is fascinating . the stereotype is that they're ugly , wrinkled , and haggard . the reality , at least in girl 6 , is somewhere in between . none of the revelations here are especially shocking -- we've seen a lot of this stuff before , anywhere from tv news magazines to robert altman's short cuts ( where jennifer jason leigh played a phone sex girl ) , but lee puts it all together and adds a few twists . unfortunately , while certain aspects of girl 6 are handled with flair , the film's dramatic scope too often isn't compelling enough for subject matter of such rich and varied possibilities . 
1	jim broadbent is sort of the british film industry's guarantee . every movie in which he has appeared can boast a certain level of quality , irrespective of whether broadbent plays the lead ( as in life is sweet or the wickedly funny mike leigh short " a sense of history " ) or has a supporting role ( enchanted april , the crying game , widows' peak ) . thus , it's no surprise that the wedding gift ( which was shown as wide-eyed and legless overseas ) transcends its sappy script . broadbent may not be able to turn this movie into an instant classic , but he keeps it watchable . occasionally , this topic can be crafted into a rare and powerful film , such as 1992's lorenzo's oil . most of the time , however , these kinds of stories are relegated to tv movies , a fare which too- rarely claims impressive performers or intelligent writing . whereas the cast of the wedding gift is top-notch , the screenplay is not . aside from the delightfully witty banter between diana ( julie walters ) and deric ( broadbent ) , there's little to distinguish this script . its moments of genuine emotion are rare ( i can think of two offhand , one of which occurs during the final scene ) , and it too often descends into melodrama . this rather unoriginal material , which is " based on a true story , " is given a tremendous lift by its performers . broadbent brings the right mix of concern and nervous humor to deric . the rest of the cast , while perhaps not as visible , is just as solid . one of the keys to the wedding gift's working on any level is the willingness of the audience to accept that diana and deric are genuinely in love ( not the kind of romantic love portrayed in most films , but a deeper , more lasting emotion ) . while the script doesn't do a whole lot to get this across , broadbent and walters force the issue through their performances , with a look here and a touch there . a glimpse of deric's worried features conveys more than any line of dialogue . watching what the actors do with their roles in the wedding gift is the film's greatest asset . enduring its attempts to twist emotions and wring tears from our eyes is its greatest detriment . a movie needs to be very good to get away with such obvious manipulation and , despite having its share of moments , the wedding gift isn't strong enough--as almost everyone ( except those who love to cry ) is likely to recognize . 
1	sgt . bilko is a highly forgettable , but quite funny remake of the classic phil silvers tv show from the mid 50s known variously as " the phil silvers show " , " you'll never get rich " , and simply " sergeant bilko . " i was a nine year old when the series started and was a fan of it . only steve martin and possibly robin williams have the comedic strength to revive the show . here it is steve martin playing the role that is both a homage to phil silvers and yet is a fresh rendition as well . in short , this is not martin at his best and the movie has a lot of gags , especially sight gags , that don't work , but the movie does has a lot of belly laughs in it . a sure fire audience pleaser even if not exactly blockbuster material . i think this movie has some of the worst trailers for it that i have seen in quite a while , but i saw them so often that this slapstick comedy began to grow on me a bit before i ever walked into the theater . the movie has exactly three things going for it and no more . the acting by martin , that of straight man dan aykroyd playing sgt . the rest of the acting is fairly pedestrian but phil hartman as major thorn as well as his two accountant sidekicks are awful . most of the technical aspects of the show like the cinematography , music , and sets are acceptable , but nothing special . his philosophy about gambling is , " i like a sporting event in which i know the outcome ahead of time . it's more organized . " he does not run a very tight ship . it's 10am . in the funniest part of the show , sgt . the outcome is hilarious . bilko , and the plot of most of the show is that major thorn tries to prove a case against bilko . bilko is a conniver , but also a whiner . everything that martin does is cute right down to the way he carries himself and his funny little quasi-mocking salute . sgt . bilko runs a quick 1 : 32 thanks to fast paced editing by tony lombardo . i was amazed to find the show was a correctly rated pg one . i expected something much raunchier . there is no sex , nudity , or violence . if they said any bad words , i can not remember them . sgt . bilko is not great art , but i laughed a lot as did the rest of the audience , and i think you will too so i recommend the film and give the picture * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	picture bride is straightforward and poignant tale simply told . it is reminiscent of one of john steinbeck's short novels . although the movie is full of tragedy , hardship , and miserable living conditions , it is nevertheless , a serene and peaceful show . the quiet determination of the people , as amply demonstrated by their ability to sing joyfully even when oppressed , shows an inner peace that seems to permeate the audience as well as the characters . picture bride tells a part of history that i did not know about . one of the exciting reasons to be a movie-goer is to be able to live vicariously segments of history that our teachers never taught us . unlike most of the brides who will go to be laborers in hawaii on sugar cane plantations , riyo is not from the country . you may remember tomita from the wonderful the joy luck club . i do not recall having seen any of the other actors before . although the movie is about inner strength , coping , and finding fulfillment , there are other themes . i liked the script by kayo and mari hatta based on a story by diane mark - clear and crisp . another writer that came to mind while watching the movie was hemmingway . my only problem with the story was that i did not find the bad character credible . he was written as too much of a caricature . a more realistic evil would have improved the tale . it may have been that director kayo hatta just wanted to paint his canvas in nothing but stark black and white images . one final aspect of the movie worth mentioning is the nighttime cinematography ( claudio rocha ) , set decoration , and sound effects . the daytime images of the burning cane fields was also striking . the sometimes dramatic and sometimes serene music ( cliff eidelman ) throughout the movie provided just the appropriate ambiance . there is not much of a plot to picture bride . it does provide nice imagery and low key but well done acting . it is not a terrific show , but a peaceful diversion . picture bride runs 1 : 41 including 10 minutes of extremely long credits that acknowledge 18 historical advisors ( 16 of whom were dr . this or that ) and even thanks the shoe repairmen . it is rated pg-13 for reasons that escape me . this is a pg movie bordering on a g rating . if you think your kids would be interested in the story , it would be fine to take them . i recommend this little movie to you and award it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : may 9 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	[note that followups are directed to rec . arts . movies . current-films and rec . arts . startrek . current only , not to rec . arts . sf . movies . star trek has fans like no other series . trekkies have almost a religious devotion to the series . i still remember the first time i met a master level trekkie . i was at a party where a tv was playing , and she was reciting not some , but all the lines before the characters spoke them . i stared in awe at her . this review is not for her or her likes . this review of star trek : first contact is aimed at the rest of us . she will undoubtedly recognize and appreciate nuances in the picture that mere mortals will miss . first , an admission . i have seen some of the films in the star trek series but not all . some i've liked , and some i haven't . i do not remember any that were bad nor any outstanding . as a non-devotee , i find the films good solid entertainment , but nothing more . this is not meant as a put-down . as a critic , it is a relief not to have every film try to force your emotional systems into a complete meltdown . being able to kick back and just enjoy an old fashion adventure is a welcome respite for my nervous system . " i am a computer cyborg . if they can do that , they will populate the earth with nothing but borgs . this plot device lets much of the movie be filmed in a pine forest . the script by rick berman , brannon braga , and ronald moore never takes itself too seriously . the show is peppered with little bits of humor . costume designers robert blackman and deborah everton chose the outfit of a geriatric hippie for him . cromwell has great fun playing the part of a reluctant legend who would rather drink whiskey than do anything else . this is one of many homages to older movies . the show is full of logical flaws like this . why the whole room full of dancing strangers ? logic , of course , is not the point , and the scene is a colorful diversion . woodard gets to say some of the cornier lines including , " it's my first ray gun , " and " watch your caboose . " she never gets in sync with the rhythm of a science fiction film . brent spiner as data is the most fun to watch . quite a complement to stewart's brooding as the captain . lily makes fun of this with , " captain ahab has to have his whale . " at times , the show takes itself seriously as when picard barks out about the borg battle , " the line has to be drawn here . this far and no farther . " having recently watched sci-fi films from 50's classics to star wars to independence day , i found the special effects by terry frazee in star trek : first contact closer to the hokey 50s' material . watch especially the cheap model they used in the scene where they look up at the enterprise from a telescope on earth . i once read that the reason the studio likes the star trek series is that since they are relatively inexpensive to film , they are always quite profitable . star trek films have a basic appeal , and fancy effects would probably just detract anyway . like an old orchestra , the cast seems to run on auto-pilot so i still have little opinion on his directorial skills . the final question becomes : is there enough here for non-trekkies , and i think the answer is yes . a completely forgettable , but pleasant enough time at the your local bijou . a good popcorn movie . i missed getting the press kit at the screening , but that is about what my watch said . the film is rated pg-13 for cartoonish violence and a few profanities . there is no sex or nudity . the film would be fine for kids , but my guess is that they would need to be 8 or 9 to understand it . i give the picture a thumbs up and rate it * * 1/2 . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
0	for those who think that what movies need today are more elaborate gimmicks , time code is the answer , since it is nothing but one long , insufferable gimmick . collectively these 4 movies form one story with the characters moving freely between the sections of the screen . the most exciting parts are when the characters place cell phone calls across quadrants for a little chitchat . the result is the artistic type of experiment that seems designed to put film critics in ecstasy over the movie's showy , avant-garde techniques . the film would seem destined to be played and discussed ad nauseam at college film courses . it should be pointed out that one can achieve almost the same effect any afternoon at your local sears store by turning 4 adjoining television sets on 4 different soap operas . yes , this approach will not permit the interaction between frames , but soap operas are so alike that you can easily imagine that the characters in the various shows are conversing . most viewers , however , will be more likely to point out time code's two fatal flaws . first , none of the stories in time code are worth including in a normal movie . most of the stories will have viewers alternating between wondering what they are about and not caring what the answer is . second , although having multiple screens is undeniably cute , it is just a distraction . sony's new marketing campaign suggests that viewers see the movie four times , watching a different quadrant at each session . since it's only the interaction between the quadrants that make the story the least bit compelling , concentrating on one would be painful . the large , stellar cast improvise their parts based on a written outline . figgis raises the audio level in the quadrant on which he would like us to focus , but even when he tries to get our eyes elsewhere , it's hard to look away as these two actresses in the back of a limo play kissy-face like a pair of love-struck teens . the only completely satisfying part of the production is the music , especially a long , dreamy section of a gustav mahler symphony . closing your eyes enhances the pleasure , but you run the risk of falling asleep . this is also a problem with your eyes open . i would rather have seen that movie than time code . it is rated r for drug use , sexuality , language and a scene of violence and would be acceptable for older teens . 
0	so what is the value of a video game that can only be watched ? especially one with long patches of leaden and ridiculous dialog such as , " my ignorance amuses me . " ( hmm , does that mean the studio will spare us a sequel until the year 7001 ? we're probably not going to be that lucky . ) among the movie's " memorable " moments is an attack sequence that looks like something from the planet of the easily broken stone apes . croft is an indestructible fighting machine like a typical video game character . " lara's overrated , " one of the characters remarks . boy , i'd say . that way , when you quickly get bored and leave , you'll have saved yourself time and money . it is rated pg-13 for action violence and some sensuality and would be acceptable for kids around 9 and up . my son jeffrey , age 12 , gave the movie * * * * , saying the action was great and the plot was pretty good . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
2	toy story is an absolutely wonderful movie for both kids and adults . it stretches your mind creatively to look at inanimate objects with a new respect , and it dazzles your senses with a wonderful new art form , the full length computer generated movie that is a cross between a disney cartoon and a live action film . moreover , in a year with some quite imaginative kids movies ( the indian in the cupboard and the secret of roan inish being the second and third best of 1995 ) , this one stands head and shoulders above all of the rest . toy story is special because of the story itself and because of the computer generated animation that is nothing less than phenomenal . yes , this has been done before perhaps , but not to this scale and degree of sophistication . i look forward to many more magical pictures from this creative team . woody holds this elevated position by virtue of being andy's favorite toy . the tension surrounds what toys andy will get . the walk of the toy soldiers is great . remember that cheap toy soldiers have their feet stuck on a single strip of plastic which makes sneaking up on the enemy extremely difficult . this could mean their demise too , and as hamm , the piggy bank , puts it , " yes sir , we're next month's garage sale fodder for sure . " woody laments , " what chance does a toy like me have against a buzz lightyear action figure ? " the majority of the movie is about the conflicts between woody and buzz . there are excellent lessons taught to kids along the way . the story is full of demonstrations of good moral values as well as the illustration of what leading an evil life like that of the neighborhood bad kid , sid , can get you . i will not give any of this away . the ending is perfect too . see it all yourself . the toys are hyper-realistic , but the people in the movie are drawn more cartoon characterish . my wife , sally , said that she thought this was to make the point that it is the toys in the story that are real more than the people . i suspect she is right . the colors of the toys have a luminescence that i have not seen before on the screen . the accuracy of the toys is reminiscent of the vermeer and the other great dutch painters of the seventeenth century , absolute devotion to the small details and to lighting effects . the wonderful script ( joel cohen , john lasseter , alex sokolow , andrew stanton , and joss whedon ) uses dialog to make the toys come alive and yet be extremely funny . rex , the dinosaur , introduces himself to buzz saying , " i'm from mattel . well , actually i'm from a smaller company that was purchased by mattel in a leveraged buyout . " i hope the writers win a lot of awards . toy story runs a fast and extremely well paced 1 : 17 . i posit no one will get bored during this movie . it is rated g but i should warn people that young viewers may get scared by sid and his toys . luckily our two families had more laps than kids so that when the scary scenes came , all kids had a place to go . perhaps you should check your kid to lap ratio before you go . jeffrey gets angry at shows that scare him , but not this one . he took it in stride as part of the movie going experience . his version of revisionist history , by the way , claims that he actually gave the movie six thumbs up rather than just two . i give the movie my strongest recommendation and award it a full * * * * . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	cast : sandra bullock , dennis miller , jeremy northam , diane baker , wendy gazelle director : irwin winkler producers : irwin winkler and rob cowan screenplay : john brancato and michael ferris cinematography : jack n . green music : mark isham u . s . distributor : columbia pictures welcome to cyberspace , the newest locale for the action-adventure film . borrowing heavily from alfred hitchcock and john grisham , director irwin winkler reduces a potentially-fascinating premise to the spearhead of a routine thriller . the net starts off strong but finishes weak , and if not for the presence of actress sandra bullock , who graces nearly every scene , this movie might have been a snoozer . for the third picture in a row ( the other two being speed and while you were sleeping ) , bullock's simple , understated portrayal is noteworthy . she draws the audience's sympathy like a magnet . no matter how silly the plot contrivances get , we still have a vested interest in the fate of the main character . this isn't just good acting -- it's an example of something far more rare and potent : genuine screen presence and appeal . the first hour of the net is engaging , but the movie runs into trouble slightly past the midpoint . the kernel of originality pops , and we're subjected to a number of run-of-the-mill chases . as the quotient of traditional thriller cliches to innovative elements grows , the net becomes progressively more mundane , and the final resolution is too facile to be satisfying . the net can be seen as a cautionary tale to those who believe that complete reliance upon computers is a good thing . twenty years ago , this script would have been science fiction ; today , significant portions are grounded in reality . in the net , big brother isn't only watching ; he's taking action as well . it's too bad the movie gradually loses its awareness of this ominous danger . i guess car chases are easier to film . in the final analysis , however , sandra bullock is the trump card , and she keeps the net interesting . while this film lacks the impact of a truly gripping thriller , it gives us a protagonist to root for and stick with , no matter how familiar certain aspects of the plot are . fascination with the internet may be the motivation for entering a theater showing this movie , but bullock is the reason to stay to the end . 
1	while it's true that making good romantic comedies is still something of an art , producing average films of the genre has become a science . take a little chemistry , a portion of physics , some basic biology , and mix them together according to a well-understood formula , and you have a result guaranteed to give audiences everywhere that mushy , feel-good sensation they crave . while you were sleeping , a movie likely to appeal to the sleepless in seattle crowd , is a perfect example of this unoriginal-but-enjoyable type of film making . the story opens with a voiceover as the camera gives us the sights of modern-day chicago . while you were sleeping is a pleasant movie that looks like it was originally designed for a christmas release . considering 1994's pathetic holiday fare ( mixed nuts , trapped in paradise ) , it would have been welcome . nevertheless , no love story is confined by a time of year , and this one works nearly as well in april as in december . the story has a little more depth than the usual romantic drivel . just no one to laugh with . " the relationship is warm but not especially passionate . there certainly aren't any sparks , and physical contact is limited to a kiss under the mistletoe . in some ways , this restrained view of love and sex is a throwback to hollywood's early era . sandra bullock ( speed ) is an amazingly engaging performer . though not the best actress of her generation , she has a winning smile and a variety of noteworthy expressions . she's perhaps at her best looking bewildered , and this movie gives her plenty of opportunities to do that . the supporting cast is okay , although everyone appears a little too cheerful for a family whose son is in a coma . while you were sleeping has its share of nice moments , none of which are especially memorable . the plot runs out of steam just past the one-hour mark and the charade , although necessary to the story , goes on for too long . the ending is , of course , the requisite happy one , but it seems a little anticlimactic . and we definitely don't need bullock's narration to supply us with the meaning of the title . all-in-all , while you were sleeping delivers what it advertises : no surprises , but a load of warm feelings . 
2	much has been written about sylvester stallone's return to serious acting in copland . it's an entirely different matter , however , to watch the action superstar in this new role than it is to read and hear about it . the most noticeable thing about freddy isn't the caliber of his gun , it's the size of his paunch . it's a strange thing to see stallone playing someone whose primary characteristic is impotence . while this is probably the actor's best turn since rocky , and he does a credible job that may earn him the opportunity to do more " serious " work in the future , stallone's performance is outshone on all sides . that's not a knock against him ; it's an acknowledgment that the supporting cast is about the best that it can be . although keitel's one-dimensional , over-the-top portrayal isn't all that impressive , both ray liotta and robert deniro manage to craft well-developed , interesting characters . in smaller roles , janeane garofalo , robert patrick , and anabella sciorra are equally impressive . writer/director james mangold , who earned the chance to make copland on the strength of his debut feature , heavy , uses the same kind of main character here as in the previous film . the relationship between these two is one of copland's most fascinating elements , but it lacks any kind of resolution , and that represents one of several frustrating aspects of the film's ending . ultimately , copland is just another story of police corruption in new york city -- a western transposed into modern times . copland is an energetic movie , but the plot is a little too ambitious . the interaction between individual characters is often highly enjoyable , but , when you try to take in the entire story , implausibilites leap to the surface ( not the least of which is how easily a high-profile individual can be presumed dead with the media swarming around and everyone in one town knowing that he's still alive ) . the film's logic is more than a little suspect , and quite a few plot threads are left dangling by the time that the final reel is over . late reshoots may have given copland a better sense of closure , but they don't address all the unanswered questions . with that in mind , it should be recognized that this is a movie to be appreciated for individual scenes , some of which are dynamic and powerful . and there is a certain visceral satisfaction in the resolution , as is often the case in a cop movie . in addition to the high caliber of acting , another thing that sets copland apart from an average entry into the genre is mangold's dialogue , which sparkles with intelligence . the director may not have tarantino's gift for words , but his characters speak reasonably , not like they're reading from a sheet of paper . even the supporting players , like janeane garofalo's officer cindy betts , say and do things in a believable manner . as i indicated , the overall story has problems , but mangold is a master of the moment , and he gets us to care about the characters enough that we don't spend one-hundred minutes obsessing over flaws . as a result , copland is a compelling , if imperfect , motion picture . 
2	cast : denzel washington , john goodman , donald sutherland , embeth davidtz , james gandolfini , elias koteas director : gregory hoblit producers : charles roven , dawn steel screenplay : nicholas kazan cinematography : newton thomas sigel music : tan dun u . s . distributor : warner brothers call it touched by a demon . if marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . in fact , there's even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion's share of the weirdness distilled out . the biggest failing of fallen is that , although it's consistently interesting , it's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . as depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one . no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . this is the kind of setting where it's easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . fallen's plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . somehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . but the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . of the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . washington's flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . it's not that he's bad per se , but he's not very interesting . there's no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . washington's subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . however , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler's list ) and donald sutherland . to be fair , the flaws in their characters aren't all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written . that said , however , there's nothing inspired about either davidtz's or sutherland's work . both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . narratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . although the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . at times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like " i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself " become a little hard to swallow . in addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . however , despite the negatives , i'm still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved . the final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected . it's not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . this is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it's a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . and , whatever you do , don't walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll . - ingmar bergman 
0	atkinson with his almost mute acting shtick grunts a lot in the movie but speaks very little , probably no more than a hundred words in the entire picture . his style of comedy lives or dies based upon how funny you find his exaggerated physical humor . although his fans may find bean well worth their time , others may find this 1 : 30 film about 1 : 27 too long . there is probably enough humorous material in bean for a " saturday night live " skit , but as a full-length movie it does little more than provide an opportunity to get to know your watch better . the dull and relatively ugly cinematography by francis kenny does not help break the film's tedium . bean is supposed to speak at the picture's unveiling . alison is the smartest one in the film and the only one who had the good sense to walk out . let me give you a flavor of the brand of humor which the movie relishes . we have bean with a cigarette lighter up his nose one time and tissue stuck up it another . and mainly he makes several variations of the classic funny face in which one contorts every facial feature .

" so we get more grunting and grimacing . i agree -- very distant . bean runs 1 : 30 , but feels much longer . the movie is rated pg-13 for sexual humor . the movie would be acceptable for kids 10 and up . we considered taking our 8 year old , but wisely rejected that idea .

1	when i went into the press screening of prefontaine , i was excited on several counts . first , and foremost , director steve james's last picture was the great documentary hoop dreams , which he produced and directed . i cannot tell you how much i loved that movie . it easily made the top of my best of the year list for 1994 as it did both siskel's and ebert's . second , it was exciting to see a brilliant documentarian try his hand at his first non-documentary . before i begin commenting of the quality on the film , a warning is perhaps in order . he was great , but i cannot say the same for the film about his life . it was a big disappointment for me . the biggest problem with the movie is the script by steve james and eugene corr . it rarely rings true and is full of trite little phrases . the more obvious , but actually secondary , problem is that james decided to make prefontaine as if it were a documentary . there are numerous cuts to talking heads where the actors with the character's names below them talk as if they were not actors . a little of this might have worked , but combined with the poor script , it came off as terribly stilted . the film's pacing is uneven so that the film frequently drags . many scenes that editor peter frank should have deleted are included . leto has deep blue eyes that seem to engulf the viewer . although physically charming , i had a lot of trouble believing leto was the pre that they talked about . leto smiles excessively and is never convincing as someone who is supposedly so obsessed with winning . his signature role was as sgt . if you recognize his voice , it may be because he did the voice of the sergeant in toy story . in prefontaine he plays his character as too aloof and quirky . except for the great shoes he makes for pre , ermey's coach seems disinterested and fairly useless . my suspicion is that bowerman was more than just the cobbler to which the film relegates him . easily the best part of the picture is when pre is running . too often the film is full of talking heads and short , hallow speeches when it should have been back on the field . the further the film gets away from the track , the more it bogs down . pre has to answer mindless questions from the reporters like , " hey pre , how you going to beat the best of the world on their turf ? " pre's story is reduced to a series of banal sound bites by the script and the editor . the film tries to cast the organization that runs amateur track ( atu ) as a villain , but it makes the atu into such a pillsbury doughboy that it is not particularly effective . " i hate christmas and thanksgiving and easter -- anything that breaks my routine . " many actors are wasted in the film , but none so badly as amy locane , who was excellent last year in her lolita-style part in carried away . most people missed her performance in it , which is a shame . this talented actress is given a part with no substance . very few documentarians are good at making feature length movies . he should stick to what he does best . it is rated pg-13 for two intense , but non-graphic , violent scenes and for some profanity . there was what appeared to be a seven-year-old near me . the movie scared him quite a bit in the intense parts . kids , say nine or ten and up , should be able to handle the movie fine . a close call , but prefontaine is not well made enough for me to recommend it . that i would like to see . i give the movie prefontaine * * . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

2	sleuth , a 1972 " thinking person's thriller , " is a rich , engaging motion picture with surprises lurking in the shadows behind every narrative corner . it's a perfect metaphor for all that is to come , as the two men square off in a series of increasingly- desperate games . this is the kind of movie where the payoff isn't about getting to the end , but in savoring every moment on the long , winding trip that takes us there . this is essentially a two-man stage show transformed into a movie . with the exception of a brief showing by british thespian alec cawthorne , the only actors on screen are olivier and caine . both are so good that there's not a moment when we wish for someone else to interrupt their duel . never has such seemingly limited one-on-one interaction been so arresting . olivier is universally recognized as one of the best actors ever to grace the screen ( big or small ) . whether as heathcliffe in wuthering heights , darcy in pride and prejudice , the lead in hamlet , moriarty in the seven per cent solution , or lord marchmain in " brideshead revisited , " olivier never disappointed . sleuth is easily one of his meatiest roles -- a chance to let go and act with relish . andrew wyke is a petty snob , but olivier makes him into a figure of both great humor and great tragedy . while we never sympathize with andrew , we do something far more important -- we understand him . olivier received one of his ten career acting oscar nominations for his work in this film , and , while it would be hyperbole to call this his most impressive outing , it's certainly one of his most memorable . michael caine's career has been somewhat more checkered than olivier's . nevertheless , while one might question the man's motives for appearing in certain films , there's no doubting his talent , and it's all on display in sleuth . but , as a result of andrew's cruelty , we soon recognize there's steel beneath milo's mild-mannered exterior . the brilliance of caine's portrayal is that we accept and believe every small transformation of personality that milo undergoes . at this point , i want to insert a warning into this review : because it's virtually impossible to discuss sleuth in any detail without giving away some of the surprises , i'm cautioning readers who want a " virgin " experience to stop reading now ( and come back once you've seen the movie ) . while my intention is not to reveal everything ( the ending , for example , will go unmentioned ) , certain plot elements will be exposed . and , while sleuth can easily be enjoyed by those who know the story inside out , why spoil some of the fun if you haven't already seen it ? to milo , it sounds like the perfect plan . there's only one problem ? andrew isn't serious . milo proves that not only is he a player of andrew's caliber , but he's faster , less principled , and more shrewd . by the time the end credits roll , it's clear who has had the final laugh . the viewer sits enraptured through the entire match between these two players , watching a series of unexpected plot twists unravel on-screen . the labyrinth at the beginning is indeed an apt metaphor . it's easy enough to guess that sleuth began life on the stage ? the narrative , with its limited setting ( most of the action takes place within a few rooms in andrew's house ) and focus on dialogue and character interaction is the kind of approach one would expect from a play . but it's hard to imagine that any live version could have been as riveting without olivier and caine , who elevate sleuth from the level of a rollicking good story to a masterpiece . here , the acting is the key , and it is never found lacking . of course , i don't mean to downplay the contribution of director joseph mankiewicz or playwright/screenwriter andrew shaffer , both of whom share credit with the actors for sleuth's success . shaffer's script is delicious ? witty , intelligent , and full of the unexpected . and , while olivier certainly has all the best lines , caine has the most glorious non-dialogue moments , such as the scene in which he dresses up as a clown in preparation for breaking into andrew's house . those who enjoyed the convolutions in david fincher's the game will find that sleuth offers many of the same pleasures without the most obvious drawback ( blatant manipulation of the audience ) . this tremendously entertaining motion picture is as effective today , more than a quarter of a century after its release , as it was in 1972 . it's not the easiest movie to find on videotape ( although it has just been released in the new dvd format ) , and many of the existing copies are in poor condition , but it's more than worth the effort to seek out . " my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . " -- david puttnam

( or would condolences be a more appropriate term ? ) one piece of advice , though : in no circumstances , even under threat of torture , admit to anyone that you were suckered into seeing this , one of the worst movies of the year . then again , if you actually endured all one-hundred eleven minutes of this motionless picture , there's probably little anyone can do to you that would be less pleasant . okay , so perhaps that's overstated , but words like " bad , " " ill-conceived , " " unforgivable , " and even " putrid " don't do the film justice . except for one laugh--and a pretty feeble one at that--trapped in paradise is devoid of any characteristics that even the most undiscriminating movie-goer hopes for in a film . in this case , less would have been a whole lot more--or at least a whole lot more easily endured . the storyline is a sloppy and ineffective mixture of failed slapstick , humorless jokes , stock characters caught in predictable situations , and feeble attempts at mawkish sentimentality . the quality of this film , with its formula car chases , endless running around , and incredibly moronic protagonists , is an all-time low for a three stooges takeoff . none of the actors acquit themselves even passably . even the normally-reliable nicolas cage looks like a man aware that he's on the deck of a sinking titanic . the best solution for anyone intrigued by the premise of trapped in paradise would be to rent the john dahl noir thriller . it would certainly save a lot of grief . even dante's seventh circle of hell isn't this inhospitable . the above represents the opinions of the author , and not necessarily those of bellcore or any organization within bellcore . 
2	this is a visually appealing hong kong ghost story film , that is highly stylized , told from the perspective of a courtesan , anita mui ( fleur ) . the film is evocative ; its strength lying mostly in its poetical presentation , as it masterfully weaves a visual work of great scope and intelligence . the essence of the story does not depend on whether you believe in ghosts or not , though it would help if you would not be entirely reluctant to accept the possiblity that there could be a life-after-death . fleur , still dressed as a 1930s courtesan would be dressed , appears out of place in this modern capitalistic society , that has forgotten not only its ancient roots but its recent past . this film fascinated me on many levels , but mainly , it made me wonder about unfulfilled expectations in this world and how the netherworld could really exist as a domain for such things that remain unresolved . it allows us the opportunity to ask ourselves , if we can really believe in spiritual things without being spiritual ? is there something worth dying for ? this is truly one of the best films to come out of hong kong in the modern era . even its ironical ending , is handled with great dignity and care ; and , even if , you are not convinced by the logic of this super-natural tale , the beauty of its characterization is enough to make up for any shortcomings you might have thought this film had , such as the improbability of such vivid ghosts being so openly seen by everyone . 
2	an average picture may be worth a thousand words , but the one around which a great day in harlem was formed is worth many , many more . this film tells the story of a legendary jazz photograph -- a shot taken in 1958 for esquire magazine by first-time photographer art kane . it looks like a class picture , featuring some " 58 guys who have never been together in their lives " -- performing legends like thelonious monk , dizzy gillespie , roy eldridge , count basie , and dozens of others . this motion picture , with its countless anecdotes about elements of the photograph and the effort that went into taking it , is a joy to watch . we're told about dizzy gillespie's penchant for sticking his tongue out . in addition to the interviews , there's plenty of other material to make a great day in harlem of interest . and , to supplement all this material , bach has included sequences of the performers as they appeared on a 50s tv show , the sound of jazz . the picture itself is remarkable -- an amazing feat of good fortune that a photographer could gather this many musical luminaries on the corner of lennox avenue and 125th street at 10 o'clock in the morning ( an unreasonably early hour for performers used to going to bed at dawn ) . in many ways , this film is no less worthy of observation and archiving . in addition to being a wonderful mix of culture , memories , and stories , it includes the final filmed interviews with bud freeman , buck clayton , max kaminsky , and dizzy gillespie -- the man whose last on-camera words ( which close out the film ) send the audience from the theater smiling and chuckling . if there's such a thing as a magical documentary , a great day in harlem is it . 
1	screenplay : becky johnston , based on the memoir by heinrich harrer . director : jean-jacques annaud . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , violence , profanity ) running time : 137 minutes . if you accept hollywood's version of things , history -- particularly the uglier parts of history -- is what happens while white people are watching . it's not terribly surprising , since studios generally balk at anything remotely depressing ; fears can be allayed if an established anglo actor anchors such projects . so we end up with revolution in south america through the eyes of james woods in salvador , the plight of native americans as seen by kevin costner in dances with wolves , upheaval in burma as it affects patricia arquette in beyond rangoon . . . not one of them a terrible film , but each one compromised by the sense that we couldn't be trusted to identify with a dark face . in fact , these stories aren't even about the culture involved . there is a lot to like about individual moments , technical skill and overall atmosphere in seven years in tibet . an early mountain-climbing sequence is tense and restrained , the location photography is spectacular , and the performances of thewlis and wangchuk ( enchanting as the wise yet playful dalai lama ) are solid and appealing . the relationship between heinrich and the dalai lama is the most effective element in the film , smartly rendered by becky johnston's script . it takes a while for seven years to reach that relationship , but it's well-developed once it becomes the film's focus . it's often hard to see that focus , however , because seven years in tibet is an epic which feels like it's rushing frantically from place to place . there's a lot of ground to cover in harrer's story , probably more than 135 minutes can cover , but that's all we get . rather than finding the solid narrative through-line and sticking with it , the script hunts and pecks for dramatic events over a decade of time . of course , seven years' narrative through-line is the emotional and spiritual growth of harrer , so it's hard to say whether that would have been an improvement . it's not that pitt does a bad job as harrer , though his austrian accent wanders from here to there . in fact , he does a fine job of making harrer more than just a cocky rascal ; he's thoroughly self-absorbed to the point of needing a good spanking . but pitt could give the performance of a lifetime , and we'd still be left with a film which doesn't seem to have its priorities straight . it's true that even a sweeping story needs a protagonist to give broad-scale suffering a human face , but that face doesn't have to be topped by a head of blond hair . if seven years in tibet had not attempted to be more than the biography of an interesting man , i might have enjoyed it much more . instead , its attempts to be a " message " film end up delivering the wrong messages . while the chinese conquest of tibet warrants about five minutes of screen time in seven years in tibet , harrer's project building a movie theater for the dalai lama gets twice that . it's ironic , in a way : even within the film , the media of the west threaten to overwhelm another culture . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " .

0	let's see , you're a filmmaker looking for a documentary subject that can have a catchy title about something that everyone is curious about but that only a minority fully understands . you should choose the world wide web , of course . there must be a cornucopia of fascinating people hanging out there in cyberspace whom you could interview . having a topical idea for a movie , however , is not necessarily the same as having a good one or having one that you know how to turn successfully into a motion picture . this criticism would be less relevant if home page were a better-constructed documentary or if justin proved an interesting person to interview . but neither is the case . the documentary is so poorly lit that the images are frequently indecipherable and background sounds sometimes drown out the speakers . the average home movie is of better quality . " what do you think of what i'm shooting ? " he inquires of his disinterested spouse . " i'm not looking for intense melodrama . " and he certainly doesn't find it . the fatal blow in home page comes when you realize that the title is only a pretext to interview the people in the movie , and they just aren't compelling characters . about the only connection to the web , other than random quotes from so-called experts , is watching people enter raw html code into computers -- easily , one of the most boring endeavors in modern life and one that has been rendered unnecessary by modern software anyway . home page goes on way too long at 1 : 43 . it is not rated but would be an r for nudity , profanity and drug usage and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
0	some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning , a live-action version of mr . magoo being a prime example . the cartoon figure mr . magoo , the bumbling blind man , can be quite funny , but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images . if you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls , you are right , but there is an even more astonishing selection . mayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guys chase each other with mr . magoo frequently oblivious to the fact that anyone is being chased . like home alone 3 but without any class , mr . magoo can only be described as painfully bad . fifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity . the movie's humor is pathetically lame , and the pacing is way off . when one is stuck in a theater for an hour and a half watching what claims to be a motion picture , one looks for some solace . mr . magoo provides only three such moments . the movie begins and ends with the classic cartoon version of the character , who exudes his usual charm . the only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus , the sweet little bulldog . angus demonstrates more genuine emotions and a wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture . finally , the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie , which have some of the genuineness and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked . rather than attempt to adapt mr . magoo to a non-cartoon movie , nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be a human version of the cartoon . he has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice , and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny . my wife managed to get some sleep during the movie , but i was not so lucky . hopefully , this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise and which do not . it is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages . my son jeffrey , age 8 , said he thought the movie was good and really funny , but recommends you not choose it if you want an action movie . he said he liked home alone 3 much more . his friend maxim , age 9 , said that he thought it was good but very silly and parts did not make sense . his other friend nickolas , age 8 , said he'd give the movie * * * 1/2 , but that it was really silly . 
0	why he doesn't turn the head over to the police , the most logical thing in the world to do , is never fully explained to my satisfaction . all this spy business was rather vaguely done , and gave no particular credence to the story , except it did show a large vacuousness among the young as to their country's recent history . what the film couldn't do , was make all this interesting and tangible to the story it was telling . a story which threw out many possible situations , but never delved fully into them . yet it was somewhat diverting as a study of the students and their attitudes . the naive hero is not convincing enough in his role as a seeker of justice and the film as a political thriller suffers from a lack of focused direction . it was a good idea for a film , that tried to show that metaphorically opposites might attract but can't stay together , but it was too poorly executed for one to sustain an interest in its long drawn out meandering story . 
1	the film makes it a point to show that the fictional region has its quota of local eccentrics , many of whom are related to one another . for the most part , the film is done in a campy way , balanced by veteran character actor ernie hudson playing his role seriously , taking offense at the racial slurs and showing that he's a powerful man , willing to take a strong stand for what he believes in . this is a very compelling story , aside from the weakness of claire's role , where she acts more campy than real . the film is most similar in racial tone to " to kill a mockingbird , " but is played more humorously and with less drive for its interracial sexual motives being the source for the crime . 
1	this most uncompromising film is based on the britisher j . g . but what this canadian film is trying to say about those subjects , is anyone's guess . my guess , after seeing this film three times , is that it is not trying to say anything that is revelational , but it takes a car crash -- something no one in their right mind can revel in and think they are sexually getting off on -- and depicts a sexual fetish cult that finds a car crash to be as stimulating as a sexual act . it is a film probing how strange the mind is , especially in this post-nuclear age ; and , how sex is created in the mind , and how sexual fetishes are no stranger than anything else conceived there . in lieu , of a regular storyline , the film consists of a series of obsessive scenes regarding car crashes and of having sex in a car . it is the kind of film that one will either love or hate . one thing can be said with a certain amount of reassurance , the film is a faithful adaptation of the book , even keeping the monotonous mood of the book's repetetive themes played out over and over again . at the 1996 cannes film festival , where it got mixed reviews of boos and cheers from the crowd , it nevertheless received a special jury prize for " originality . " the film has something to say that comes in the form of a veiled warning about the future of technology and the potential deepening psychopathology that is needed for a more benevolent humanity . it has caused ripples of controversy , not because of any theme it might have , but because of the sex scenes in the cars , its crossing of old moral boundaries in favor of pornography , and the way the film unfolds without a visible story . its naysayers said , it would encourage viewers to have sex while driving in their car , thereby causing accidents . all i could say to those arguments -- is horsefeathers ! if that's a legitimate reason to ban or knock a film , you might as well censor almost every film made as presenting some danger or another . one evening , james , helen , and catherine attend , what can only be described as a show that has an unusual theme , even for performance theater . hey , i've got no problems with them so far , but it seems more funny than it is serious . . . though there is something intangible about the emptiness of this film and its unwillingness to deliver any expected messages or cater to the masses demand to be entertained , that makes this film intriguing in a very special way . if the film disturbed or was meant to disturb , i can't really say that it disturbed me . it's a speculative work , like a test project , trying to see what it can come up with that works . that there is such a thing as someone having a car crash sex fetish like those in the film , seems unlikely . but that doesn't seem to matter . what matters is that this film is looking for something to say about the modern world and the new kind of strangeness it has developed . that everyone is dehumanized in this film , might be the point of it . the acting , for what the actors were asked to do-- that is , all act in an emotionless fashion except for the bizarre portrayal by koteas , is accomplished rather successfully . hunter is like them- dehumanized to a certain point , she seems to be interested in her own sexual self-satisfaction above anything else , and her near-death experience seems to have reinforced that need . for me , the story might be perceived as being more voyeuristic than controversial . it defies having a label attached to it . somehow , it drew me into its audacious storytelling . i am not annoyed to be put in the position of being a voyeur , as much as i am amazed by how all the cultists respond to their lives . the film itself is daring because it is different than other films , it covers ground where mainstream films dare not go ; its repetitiveness , its hermetic and absurd nature , make for a film that i like better than how it is perceived through all the hype it has received . i enjoyed it because it was so well-made and acted , and strangely enough , for a film that some criticized as pornographic , i found it to be in the best of taste . what it lacked was definition and perception , and a sense of getting out of its own awe-inspiring way . 
0	every once in a while , someone gets the bright idea of making an apocalyptic horror film . the omen series is probably the best-known example of this sub-genre , but it's not the only one . there's a twist here , however . in the past , lucifer has always been the bad guy . of course , that's only because it suits his purposes , but still . . . . unfortunately , viggo mortensen's devil doesn't appear until very late in the proceedings , and by then , the prophecy has long since worn out its welcome . the script , with its odd combination of biblical ramblings and gory violence , is as silly as they come . characters take all sorts of supernatural occurrences as a matter of due course . even the unexpected apparition of satan does little more than raise an eyebrow or two . as dumb as the prophecy is--and it's very dumb--at least the film rarely takes itself seriously . writer/director gregory widen apparently realized that the best way to approach the story is to take the campy road , which is exactly what he has done . the prophecy is frequently irreverent and is littered with lines of dialogue which equate to the director winking at his audience . christopher walken's wonderfully droll performance is perfect for his role as the " killer of firstborns . " alas , walken is really the only interesting performer . koteas and madsen are boring , and most of the unnecessarily protracted story centers around their characters . we never feel anything for them , so all the screen time used attempting to develop their personalities becomes wasted . in fact , " waste " is a good way to describe most of the prophecy . in the final analysis , this is a bad movie with a good sense of humor . 
0	this rambling , marathon of an epic movie , aspiring for greatness in filmmaking but in reality is a real snoozer , erupting for a few electrifying scenes , and going on for what seemed an eternity , to tell the 50 years of yugoslavian history by dividing it into 3 parts : the german invasion in 1941 , the cold war-tito socialist state period , and the ethnic cleansing and war period in 1991 . the best scenes are the ones that featured the brass band , used from the opening invasion scene , where we see the band march raucously over the ruined landscape , for no particular reason , and then is used intermittingly throughout the film . it woke me from my snooze each time , and gave life to a film that needed resuscitation . a film that tried desperately to find humor in its madcap antics and absurd characterization of individuals , which i understand to be political jibes , but i still found them to be made in a heavy handed manner and were not funny . the most memorable scene here , is the zoo being bombed by the nazis and the animals running free , which is example of another too obvious piece of symbolism . all the deceptions and hypocrisies of the leaders are reiterated over and over , along with the filmmaker's yearning for a unified country , this is done an unnecessary amount of times , until it becomes annoying to see every image as a symbol of the same theme . what saved this film from bombing out completely , was the excellent technical skills of the director and the robust performances from the two male leads , and because this part of the world is in the news again with its problems that draws us into their civil wars , having started the century with its ethnic conflicts and will end the century with its problems still not resolved . other than that , i couldn't wait for the film to end .

" it was far from clear that pay it forward would make for a great film ; there were a lot of plot threads to condense , and a definite danger of pollyanna overkill . but there was something primally satisfying about the whole idea of it , and a kicker of a finale that was a true tear-jerker on the page . great , not necessarily ; hanky-wringing and applause-inducing , most definitely . maybe a fable like pay it forward could only have worked on the page . more likely , maybe it only could have worked with a director who knew how to tell an inherently emotional story with some degree of subtlety . his classmates scoff at his optimism , but eugene is intrigued by trevor's idea . much has been made of the fact that the kevin spacey character was african-american in the novel , but pay it forward isn't ineffective because it's not faithful enough . there are quite a few things to like about the film , from helen hunt's willingness to look positively ghastly , to the use of the las vegas setting . and of course there's kevin spacey , who can always be counted on to dazzle even when the material is less than stellar . he's a fascinating screen performer , and here he gets at the hope buried in a bitter man . that's what spacey can do even when a director seems to be working against him . leder excelled as a small screen director for " e . r . , " but in pay it forward , as in deep impact , she once again misses every opportunity to make the film about more than its concept . granted , dixon's script is better with individual moments than it is at building a narrative , but leder makes a flawed script even worse . every shot involving a human face involves a close-up so intense you can count pores ; supporting characters -- notably jon bon jovi as trevor's absentee dad -- aren't given a chance to develop beyond a single note . leder's editing choices rob the moment of all its power , including pointless cutaway's to hunt's reaction shots . every time a scene calls for finding a core of emotional honesty , leder opts instead to convey sincerity by blowing up haley joel osment's head to the size of a dirigible and letting the tears roll down his pouting face . plenty of opponents of pay it forward will probably fixate on the film's final shot , which borrows blatantly from another feel-good film that shall remain nameless . once again , the problem isn't that it differs from the novel's climax ; it isn't even that it's familiar from another film . the problem is that it's simply a movie moment , one that ignores that the payoff in pay it forward should be the success or failure of trevor's idea . it's manipulative and overwrought , but the real issue is that it's not organic to the story . leder spends two hours grasping for how to tell this story visually , and almost never comes up with the appropriate choice . pay it forward is still bound to leave some viewers thinking they've seen a good film , just because it leaves them a little teary-eyed . i doubt many of them will feel any resonance from those tears 24 hours later . you managed to screw it up big time . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
2	this extra-ordinary film offers a long hard look at its subject matter , as the camera is held steadfast , not moving for insatiably long periods of time , picking up all the appropriate nuances it needs to with deliberate dispassion , as it looks at an oregon lumber mill , whose owner ( tom blair ) is faced with unsettling economic news about the business he has built-up and worked at for his 50- odd years of life . by seeing who this man is , we get to see how he adjusts to his carefully scripted life , the fly-fishing he loves to do for the sport of it , his easy and almost gentile manners , and his very definite american persona , as he is forced out of economic necessity to deal with the japanese businessmen he inherently despises , and we get a picture of a rather complicated individual , who has difficulty in communicating with himself and others , so the closer we get to him , the more we sense that there are a lot of things about him that remain unanswered . this scene could also be deemed as an attack on america's soul , exposing it to questions about truth and character , principles that are put under the microscope , as the story builds to its very tragic outcome . this is one of jost's deepest and most penetrating films , it could even be argued that he has made a classical film , as it forcefully and subtly tells an american story , replete with unanswered questions about family life that are haunting , that give the film a certain power that makes you think for a long time afterwards what is it about this country that is so raw and violent in nature , that becomes a part of the people's own nature . one of the scenes that i found most memorable , was when the camera panned the diner where tom was dining with some co-workers and all we could hear , at first , was the muffled conversations of the patrons , as the camera meticulously panned the diner , until the atmosphere of the place was fully absorbed and we returned to tom and his conversation , which became clearer , as this scene played out a daily experience most americans have had but has rarely been captured so exactly on film . this time consuming shot , is not attempted by commercial filmmakers who live in fear of losing their audience in a long non-action shot . this is one of jost's strong points , his willingness to explore territory others fear to go . jost's film can be justifiably criticized for a few lapses in the story line it didn't clarify more precisely , but more importantly , it should be praised for the poetry it brings to its story when telling about a malaise in the american culture that is difficult to come to grips with , as the american landscape is perceived as so beautiful a sight to behold and the country as so wealthy a place when compared with the rest of the world , as it asks . . . but , what does this mean if americans are not a happy people ? 
1	heaven's prisoners tries very hard not to admit what it really is . by throwing a tangled web of incoherent subplots into the mix , screenwriters harley peyton and scott frank ( get shorty ) , adapting james lee burke's novel , have cleverly concealed the fact that this movie is actually a revenge thriller . unfortunately , this camouflage has resulted in an overlong , convoluted story that's of limited entertainment value . had director phil joanou ( final analysis ) attempted something in the more straightforward style of death wish , his picture might have worked better . it certainly wouldn't have dragged on for more than two hours . it's inevitable that , in any movie featuring an alcoholic ex-cop who starts the film on the wagon , there will be some point when he takes a drink . this is just one of many cliches employed by heaven's prisoners . dave's new , laid-back life agrees with him -- he looks good and feels great , even if he occasionally gets a craving to down a beer . all of them have one message : keep your nose out of our business . there's a lot going on in heaven's prisoners , but most of it amounts to very little . all this leads to an ending that , after one-hundred thirty-plus minutes of watching and waiting , is a big letdown . although the characters are all flat stereotypes , that's no excuse for some of the bad acting . the result is an uninteresting , occasionally-overwrought performance . kelly lynch is dull as the dutiful wife . mary stuart masterson , who normally is solid , fails to convince as a " bad girl " ( much like in the movie of that title ) . presumably , heaven's prisoners is an attempt to elevate the revenge genre to an newer , more interesting level by including themes of redemption and responsibility . the problem is that retribution in the movies is a vicious , nasty business , and all the extraneous plot elements needlessly encumber the story . there are too many characters working with too little new material . in fact , this movie is so long-winded and repetitious that there are times when viewers of heaven's prisoners will feel like they're serving a sentence . 
2	cast : clara bellar , antoine basler , mathias megard , judith chancel , aurore rauscher , serge renko , michael kraft , benedicte loyen , veronika johansson director : eric rohmer producer : francoise etchegaray screenplay : eric rohmer cinematography : diane baratier music : sebastien erms u . s . distributor : artificial eye film co . in french with english subtitles if paris is indeed the city for lovers , then eric rohmer has perfectly captured the mood in his 1995 film , rendezvous in paris , which , like most of rohmer films , has taken over a year to finally reach u . s . screens . rohmer , one of france's most respected directors , is seventy-five years old , but his vision is that of someone less than half his age . he writes for young characters better than most twenty- something screenwriters , yet the thoughts and ideas presented in his films are valid for all ages . the best thing , and sometimes the only thing , about rohmer's work is the dialogue . no one makes films quite like him , and , any time a movie is distinguished by intelligent , meaningful conversation , the french film maker's name immediately comes up ( check out reviews of richard linklater's 1995 romantic comedy , before sunrise , for examples ) . films like claire's knee , chloe in the afternoon , and a tale of springtime keep us engrossed for their entire running length not because the plot goes anywhere in particular , but because we're always interested in hearing what the characters are going to say next . each segment introduces new characters , but there are certain common themes that wind throughout all three . with this triptych , rohmer is illustrating the many ways that human interaction can occur . much more happens in this episode , but i don't want to reveal anything else , except to say that rohmer has a few delicious twists in store for his viewers . of the three parts of rendezvous , this is the most plot- oriented . of the three episodes , the second is my favorite . the dialogue is perfect , causing the half-hour to pass too quickly . it's a wonderfully romantic situation that underscores rohmer's directorial skills . rohmer is a master of subtlety -- these kinds of little details are evident throughout . i've never before seen any of the actors in this film , but they're all wonderful . with so little time to present their characters , each effectively accomplishes the aim , and , even though some of them are on screen for only a few minutes , they fashion men and women that we can identify with , even when we don't particularly like them . with rendezvous in paris , as with many of his other films , rohmer proves that social intercourse can be as delightful as the sexual variety . hal hartley's recent flirt fails to do much the same thing that rendezvous succeeds at : show the varied , unpredictable results of basic , flirtatious human contact . rendezvous isn't among rohmer's great movies -- although dialogue is always the chief pleasure of his films , the full-length features allow us to delight in conversations while growing to appreciate the characters . the half-hour length of rendezvous' segments limits character identification . nevertheless , in each of his three short episodes , rohmer gives us more substance than that which is found most two-hour movies . -- ingmar bergman 
1	a general rule of summer film watching is to beware any august release featuring a major star . the only reason for a distributor to hold back such a production is a lack of faith in the picture's ability to succeed in the highly-competitive early season , and that's usually an indication of a poor movie . denzel washington is a big box office draw , and paramount's decision to strand his latest , virtuosity , in the august marketplace isn't a vote of confidence . about the best thing that can be said about virtuosity is that it's director brett leonard's most impressive effort to date -- but considering that his previous features were the awful lawnmower man and hideaway , such a statement is damning with faint praise . the problem with this film is not the star . despite slumming in a picture far below the quality of his normal fare , washington is still the best thing about virtuosity . in fact , he injects some much needed energy into the proceedings . australian actor russell crowe is an adequate bad guy , although his sid 6 . 7 lacks the vicious intensity with which crowe imbued his romper stomper skinhead . kelly lynch , who plays barnes' criminal psychologist partner , is dreadful -- and i'm not just talking about her hairdo . we could care less what happens to her character . at least we're spared a romance between her and barnes . virtuosity's failing is its plot . what passes for a storyline is part recycled formula and part incomprehensible technobabble . the film blunders along , usually making very little sense , waiting for the next ( of many ) action scenes . generally , these are well choreographed , even though they're familiar : car chases , rooftop fist-fights and shootouts , and a child-in-danger scenario . there's little in the way of originality . as was true of sandra bullock in the net , carrying virtuosity falls on washington's shoulders . for what it's worth , he makes the movie watchable . ultimately , however , he has little to work with in this dreary , film-by-numbers flick -- even ricochet offered more substance . nevertheless , given washington's presence and the promise of a virtual reality action story , virtuosity has some appeal -- provided , of course , the viewers aren't selective . 
1	a heavy going and at times annoying , but , nevertheless , embroiling drama . religion acts as an inhibiting and possessive experience throughout the film , as the first time director weaves a tale of alienation and sexual liberation in a puritan type of setting . it is easy to realize how difficult it is to break from one's religious traditions if you are raised and indoctrinated with it . the flaws in the film are that the direction is at times unfocused , as too many scenes are awkwardly shot and difficult to watch and comprehend . there just seems to be too much internally going on for any follow-up scenes to uncover all the loose ends that remain untied . the protestant family is way too complicated to gloss over its 19th century life style . the film is too long and boring at times ; and , the love affair was not credible considering the lack of passion ( these lovers were just not a believable match ) ; and , the film hammers out too many far reaching religious themes that it cannot properly address . but the acting and cinemaphotography are superb . her sexually explicit scenes with wilkinson added to the religious tremors of the film and the sense of her alienation , but since i did not find their passion convincing , it was difficult for me to believe that their relationship would have taken place . the governess is an absorbing , marvelously acted film , but not necessarily an entertaining one . 
1	sweet and lowdown , written and directed by woody allen , tells the story of emmett ray , the world's second greatest jazz guitarist . told in talking-head documentary style by jazz historians , the movie paints a vivid portrait of an artist who never really existed . he also steals , but that's just because he's a kleptomaniac . more likely , it's because she demands so little of him . blanche may have the looks that hattie doesn't , but she shows neither the love nor the loyalty . the stories are pleasant enough but not exactly compelling . sometimes there are even different versions of the same story . other times , a speaker will tell a story but question the veracity of the person he heard it from . thanks to fei zhao's radiant cinematography , the picture looks terrific . shot in warm tones of burgundy and gold , the foreground contrasts nicely with the cold , gray , overcast skies . in a movie in which so little happens -- emmett likes to wile away his time shooting rats at the dump and watching trains -- the visuals provide much of the enjoyment . the script is remarkably bereft of memorable lines and lacks much of allen's signature comedic punch . the movie's fatal mistake is the remarkably underwhelming playing by this putatively famous guitarist . although the film's jazz background score is lush , emmett's playing isn't . the song he plays most often isn't likely to wow audiences in the first place -- " i'm forever blowing bubbles . " why couldn't they have come up with more impressive musical choices for such a jazz great ? when emmett plays , it's quite pleasant but rarely more than that . it is rated pg-13 for sexual content and some substance abuse and would be fine for teenagers . 
1	some time ago , i wrote that sylvester stallone was a better actor than steven seagal . oddly , stallone , who once shone in rocky , seems to have adopted the non-emotive state in response to the desire of his most ardent fans , who want action , not character . those stallone die-hards should be pleased with their idol's latest , assassins . it effectively fills the above mandate . it's like arnold schwarzenegger essaying an existentialist--laughably absurd . and " absurd " is precisely what a good portion of assassins is . in addition to stallone's inflexible facial expression , the film is saddled with a preposterous script and hideous dialogue . plus , it weighs in at a too- long one-hundred thirty-two minutes . the plot is an excuse for gun fights . rath ( like the audience ) could care less . thus begins one of the great screen romances of the last five minutes . . . the cast is interesting . it's banderas' pecs , however , not his acting , on display here . his bain is a pure caricature--he laughs , sneers , and sweats his way through the part . as for the presence of a solid talent like julianne moore in this living comic book . . . come to think of it , though , even an accomplished actor couldn't do much with this screenplay . the action scenes are competently constructed , and the climactic shootout provides a few moments of tension , but that's scarcely reason to sit through the rest of assassins' drivel . there are plenty of more exciting , reasonably intelligent action films ( including the aforementioned lethal weapons ) available to the adrenaline junkie . of course , with all the gunplay , the body count here goes pretty high , but the biggest casualty of assassins is the viewer who expects to get something remotely original out of this recycled formula with its stony star . 
2	the godfather part iii is a good movie , with moments of rare power , but it is not a great one--a reason why many fans of the series have voiced their disappointment . oscar nominations for this film were probably based more on the godfather name and reputation than on the particular merits of this production . part iii became the first godfather not to take best picture and , despite a deserving performance , al pacino's efforts were not acknowledged . the lack of awards enthusiasm perhaps reflected a general opinion . the passing of the baton , however , carries with it a tragic price . one of the most obvious problems with the godfather part iii is that it covers little new territory . the plot is highly derivative of the original . this time , michael fills vito's role , and vincent stands in for michael . this method of too-obvious parallelism might have been more effective had vincent's character been better developed . that isn't the case , however , because michael is still the focal point . as always , pacino is a delight to watch . more than all the money and power on earth , [they] are my treasure . " it is a prophetic statement . robert duvall is missed . it's impossible not to feel the vacuum created by his absence . george hamilton's b . j . barrison is a one- dimensional necessity of plot , not a " real " character . at least the decision was made not to replicate tom hagen in barrison . hamilton is given little more to do than stand in the background and speak a few lines . coppola is pleasant enough to look at , but her range is limited , and that lack of ability diminishes several emotionally-charged scenes . this is the first godfather to have a major role defined by a poor performance . one thing that is not inferior , however , is francis ford coppola's directorial flair . the final half-hour , with its interweaving of diverse-yet-related plot lines , is choreographed with the skill of a master . there are moments of the godfather part iii that shine with the brilliance of the previous two films . despite its missteps , the godfather part iii packs enough of a punch to deserve a place alongside its predecessors . this is no poorly- conceived curiosity . not only does the film bring michael corleone's story to a conclusion , but it remains faithful to the form and style of parts i and ii . taken as one grand epic , with this chapter included , the godfather movies represent one of the most solid , emotionally-rich tales ever committed to film . 
1	mighty aphrodite is an innovative , funny , but slow woody allen comedy that woody wrote , directed , and stars in . from the very beginning there is no chemistry between the two leads , but the audience is supposed to assume that there once was . what . i don't want to adopt . not with my genes . i have award winning genes . " given how old and unhealthy woody appears in this movie , these lines bear a special poignancy . you have to ask that ? i'm the boss . lenny believes that given their good looks combined with an equal lack of intelligence they are made for each other . linda in her crazy high pitched voice says at one point , " i'm not religious either . both of my folks were episcopalians . " kevin is so dumb he can barely even construct a full sentence . together their iqs would not add up to more two digits . the innovative part of mighty aphrodite is a greek chorus that appears frequently to give lenny advice . for me , the chorus is one of the highlights of the show . it is a fresh approach that is a lot of fun . one of my favorite characters in the movie is cassandra and her best piece of dialog is " i see disaster . i see catastrophe . worse , i see lawyers ! " the problem with mighty aphrodite is that it is like a first grader learning to read . here the dialog is great in pockets , but there are no characters to care about to keep the audience's interest in between humor . there are four or more putative love stories in the movie , but none of them are believable . these problems are mainly with woody's direction and script , but the actors own some of the blame . rapaport is pathetic and delivers a caricature of a dumb boxer . sorvino gave a fairly good performance as an airhead , but nicole kidman in to die for shows how this role can be done much better . the biggest disappointment for me was helena bonham-carter ( from many movies , but my favorite is lady jane ) . instead , most of the show is played only for the cheap laughs . a real opportunity missed . finally , woody is woody , but a tired and sad looking woody . the sets by santo loquasto are pretty outlandish . these brief images form the best scene in the show . the movie is rated pg-13 for extremely explicit references to all kinds of bizarre sexual behavior . there is no nudity or violence . the movie would be probably okay for mature teenagers , but the dialog is laced with pornographic movie quality rhetoric . for a great greek chorus and for a lot of good laughs , i give mighty aphrodite a mild thumbs up , but i was disappointed by it . it had the potential for so much more . it gets * * 1/2 in my book . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : november 10 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	both are completely believable and deliver strong performances , but carrillo steals the movie in a long dramatic scene towards the end . although it is a powerful film at times , loach makes two strategic mistakes that significantly and needlessly detract from its message . brody , a tom green look-alike who darts around like harpo marx , gives the movie a comedic side that is jarringly out of place with the rest of the drama . the second mistake concerns the subtitles . since the characters would naturally speak a mixture of english and spanish , loach keeps switching the language that is being subtitled . in theory this may sound sensible , but in practice it is a disaster . if you try to read the subtitles and they turn out to be in a language you don't understand , then , by the time you stop reading and start listening , you've missed the first few words of the sentence and are frequently unable to parse what is being said . the reverse is true if you're listening carefully , only to realize that you should have been reading . since these switches may occur several times per minute , it is hard to keep track of the dialog . if loach felt that dual language subtitling were necessary , there are two ways that would have solved the problem . either have both languages subtitled all of the time -- films shown in multilingual countries like switzerland do this -- or use different colors with , say , white for english and yellow for spanish . bread and roses makes some powerful points for the union while reminding us of everyone's believe in self-reliance . were it not for the miscasting of the comical adrien brody in a serious part and for the distracting and constant switching of subtitles , i would have been able to recommend bread and roses . it is rated r for strong language and brief nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
2	the film contains some of the most exhilarating action sequences ever to reach the screen , a touching love story , and a nice subplot that has agent 007 crossing ( and even threatening to resign from ) her majesty's secret service . at first , we don't see his face -- just the back of his head in an over- the-shoulder shot . the " james bond theme " is playing , however , so there's no doubt who's supposed to be on screen . lazenby can handle the action sequences , but that's about all he masters . for most of the film , he's stiff and uncharismatic , exhibiting little of the style and charm that marked sean connery's interpretation . worse , lazenby seems to be intentionally imitating his predecessor ( a mistake that roger moore did not make in live and let die ) , which only reminds us what we're missing . even considering the leading man's limitations , however , on her majesty's secret service is still a fine motion picture . it's the only bond film where 007 genuinely falls in love . the romance comprises most of the film's first forty-five minutes , as well as the final fifteen . for a series known for its action , the sensitivity of the james/tracy pairing is surprising . rigg does a marvelous job holding up her side , and , after viewing her performance , it's not hard to understand how bond could fall for the headstrong tracy . lazenby , on the other hand , manages to be merely adequate -- this is the only occasion when a bond woman upstages 007 . the movie isn't all love-and-kisses , however . director peter hunt has a flair for these kinds of scenes , and he keeps viewers on the edge of their seats . and the placement of the " james bond theme " is without flaw . it's sad to consider what this film could have been with the original lead , but encouraging that it's so good without him . even featuring an inferior 007 , on her majesty's secret service is a landmark change-of-pace , and an exhilarating and affecting piece of entertainment . 
1	even pure formula films can have their charms . the 6th man recycles ideas and dialog from a host of other movies . not being a sports fan , i tire easily of films whose narrative consists of little more than a fast drive to the big game , which will inevitably end in the big shot that will catapult the underdogs to victory . the 6th man takes this sports film formula and crosses it with a remake of ghost , thus increasing the potential for disastrous results . generally loathing slapstick comedies and being far from the audience's intended demographical age of twelve plus or minus four , i , nevertheless , enjoyed this sweet little film . director randall miller , whose last picture was the poorly received houseguest , paints his film using broad humor mixed with a tinge of pathos . the genuine chemistry between kenny and antoine puts extra punch in their gentle jabs at each other . " you should forget females , " antoine chides kenny . he does this by such antics as picking up the huskie players and flying them up to the basketball hoop and by sitting on the opposing team's hoop and keeping their balls from going in . wayans and hardison are instantly likable stars . their cliche-ridden characters still manage to be engaging . although there are a couple of funny lines , the film derives most of its laughs from the physical comedy surrounding the long running joke that only kenny can see his brother . this scene and those words appear verbatim in almost every ghost movie . my favorite comedy routine in the show involves the team's mascot . always ending in humorous pain to the mascot , the sequences are reminiscent of the coyote in the road runner cartoon and his quest to find a gimmick that will enable him to catch that pesky road runner . the show has some nice special effects where antoine's body is distorted in various ways . other than the two stars , the other actors add little to advance the story . the basketball team is a careful mix of characters of every type , but none with any depth . the threadbare and risk-adverse script by christopher reed and cynthia carle needs more substance and originality . they feed a lot of one-liners to the on-court announcers , but most fall flat . no matter how minimal the supporting cast and the writing , the two leads carry the show . their brotherly love radiates readily into the audience . i've seen their vaudevillian style of humor many times before , but they are so good spirited that i still found myself laughing with the rest of the crowd . it is rated pg-13 for some profanity and innuendoes . the film would be fine for kids 7 and up . my son jeffrey , almost 8 , said , " i love it . it is so good .

1	he becomes the source of parody , as the doctors piece him back together , whereby he can't talk clearly , looks grotesque , and has holes in his throat so that when he smokes , the smoke can be seen coming out of his throat . the prison scenes were over-the-top , trashy , and fun to watch , as the director did not care a damn about drama or plot . the film shoots for tongue-in-cheek humor in the interactions between characters and also it aims to cast some black humor on the social hypocrisies of the welfare , judicial , and penal systems . as satire , this film is tops . it was excessive , but it had enough bite in it to do some damage . reese witherspoon's performance was contagious , watching her cut-up , act-tough , be vulnerable , and drop comic lines with a natural ease , and all the time , the film had the feel of being noir , even though it was really satire . it had enough toughness in it to be viewed as a thought provoking film , when the action cleared and the cartoonish-type of laughs emanating from the veggie-like characters died down . the film had a lot of little things going for it , that added up to big plusses . the film's opening credits had the grimm fairy tale story of little red riding hood depicted in its cartoon drawings . freeway has the look of a crazed fable , as bulky onscreen figures are made to look less imposing at each impending scene and the vulnerable ones either die or get stronger just by surviving amidst such violent chaos . the film draws to its inevitable conclusion- of blood and gore , despair and muted hope , and the irrelevancy of the 1990s in trendy california , which can be seen as a failed center-piece for social change . the film's sordid family scenario , leaves its sensationalized news stories mockingly imprinted on the airwaves , depicting how sad life is and how cartoon-like are the players , left to their own vanities , frolicking in an artificial landscape of alienation and violent gestures . 
0	high fidelity ( director : stephen frears ; screenwriters : d . v . this wormy role is one that he has been seemingly typecast for in most of his films to date . his narcissistic performance totally grossed-me out , even though i liked a few things about this feel-good , quirky movie , but whose plot could have been better explored if it was discovered what the plot was and whose story would have been given more credence if it had a sharper script , a better sense of pacing , and less screen time for the annoying cusack character . cusack spent nearly ninety percent of the film's time looking right at the camera and explaining to the audience what he was thinking and doing , as if the story was made for an einstein-type and needed to be decifered to the under-thirty something audience targeted to see this film . rob is griping to the camera about his failures in romance , and in imitation of the david letterman's tv show shtick of making lists to elicit laughs from the audience , rob is prone to making top 5 lists , having recently completed his " top 5 all-time breakups " , going through those he most clearly recalls , giving the audience a running narration on each of those romances . by gosh , what is this fine comedic actress doing in this film , and to the bargain , taking such a miniscule part ! laura ( iben hjejle-a danish actress making her american debut ) is the best thing about this film . her lips are of a succulent ruby red color , and when she pouts or a small smile comes over her , there is a very sensuous crease that comes over her mouth and chin area-- plus she has a nice laugh and cries in a dignified manner when she has to . what the film does well , is capture the nostalgia and musty atmosphere of a place where music geeks hang-out , memorizing tunes and reciting them back-and-forth to each other , as if they were idiot savants who overdosed on sugar . he's a van morrison clone without the singer's voice or forebearance or manners . the clerks' attitude toward the customers was brusque , but the exchanges that resulted were very dear . in keeping with the spirit of the film , i made a top 5 list of things i liked about the film and a more involved top 5 list of things that i didn't like about the film . first what i liked : 1 . the soundtrack kicked ass . 2 . the two musical geek clerks were funnier than batman and robin in hell . i didn't have to pronounce iben hjejle's name to know what i liked about her . 4 . lisa bonet made up for her inconsequential part and gratuitous sex scene by adding a beautiful song to the film and a warm presence to a story that wasn't that hot to begin with . i can count on my left hand how many films were made about geek music-store clerks who work in musical stores that are not in a mall . what i didn't like : 1 . john cusack is either a putz or someone who is acting like a putz , but in either case , i can't handle watching a needlessly long film ( over two hours ) such as this one , with someone as self-absorbed as he is , without getting a headache . 2 . the story seemed to be a never-ending one , where there were at least three times that i thought the movie had wound down and was about to conclude . instead , the movie got a second wind and added more banal storyline to keep it going . it seemed to be poorly edited and written with a few different endings in mind and failed to make its rewrites seamless . the result is a very shoddy film , even if it is adapted from a popular cult comic novel of the same name written by nick hornsby . the film has not been improved by changing the setting from london to chicago , and as far as i'm concerned , it could have been set in mars or venus , with the same results gleaned . the love angle was predictable and wimpy . but this was formula sitcom stuff all the way , as all three music geeks got some reward for their long-suffering for the art of nostalgia and trivia and useless knowledge . 4 . for a movie that is about growing up , maturing , and handling relationships , somehow the characters didn't particularly make me interested in how any of their relationships were resolved . i felt used by this film . and i had to listen to him kvetch for the entire film and i'm not even a psychoanalyst who gets paid to hear such dribble but a long-suffering movie critic who was bored to death by this very forgettable pop culture movie and couldn't wait for the session ( uh ! movie ) to end . 
2	now this is an indie cult film , if ever there was one . they sell both bibles and guns , two contrasting products that fit very well into the mainstream of american society , makes for a most interesting commentary on the american landscape , as directed and written by the south african , daniel j . harris . this b/w , gritty film , is so well-paced and flies by so quickly , that you feel you know these men in the short time span you meet them and you don't want the film to end before you find out just what happens to them , as things begin to turn sour for them . this unique film , in the style of the maysles brother's the salesmen , packs a wallop and a sales pitch that goes beyond the ordinary pseudo-documentary and improvisational work . the theme of the film is really geared for the 1960s in psychology , in the music played and in the dress and style of the salesmen . but were're in the '90s all right and that only adds weight to the idea that these men are really dead already but they just don't know it . these very repulsive reactionary types are so-well caught on camera , as they go from reading the script to ad libbing without missing a beat , in fact the unrehearsed scenes have a special flair about them that is macabre . one of the really powerful scenes , is the opening one when they are selling the collectors' edition bible set and a defender 500 pump-action shotgun in a trailer , it is almost unnerving that they keep a straight face when they say to the poor whites they are selling this to , " the american family deserves to be well-armed and well-read . " the director seems to imply , isn't that what america is about , anyway . they sold me on this film . these " stars " certainly bring a level of authenticity to the film that is uniquely satifsying . this , suprisingly enough , is a not to be missed film , if you can ever locate it on cable . 
1	milk money has a lot going for it . it has two stars i like , melanie griffith and ed harris , and has an interesting plot . if you have seen the trailers , you know it has a lot of good comedy . on the other hand , this is a schizophrenic movie . it can not make up its mind if it is a movie for the early teen set or its target audience is grownups . every time the script starts to click in one direction , it stops entirely and switches . you get to like the movie and you start laughing , and then it enters another slump almost as if it is scared to follow through with the courage of its convictions in either direction . this part of the plot works very well and produces a lot of laughs . notice in the show that harris is shorter than griffith . this is not unusual , but normally , they are careful with the camerawork to mask the difference by the direction of the shots . here it is okay to be a shorter man . even the kids in the show have girlfriends taller than them . i especially liked this aspect being to some extent a height challenged male . much of the show is devoted to a romance between harris and griffith which is not played in a believable fashion , and there is no real chemistry between them . there is another boring and unnecessary subplot about bad guys wanting to find griffith . this subplot seems to be from another movie and to have gotten stuck in this script by mistake . worst of all is the depiction of what it is like to be a single dad . it depicts cliches of single daddydom whereby the son and dad microwave tv dinners for 100% of their meals and always race , stopwatch style , to see who can gobble down their dinners the fastest . chaining himself to his car to save a swamp is certainly the low point of the movie . i had a pretty good time at the movie since much of the comedy part did work , but i should point out that if you have seen the trailers , you have seen half of the jokes already . i can not bring myself to actually recommend milk money , and i give it * * . it runs 1 : 50 and is rated pg-13 for a little bit of profanity . actually , i think that kids around the 7th grade area would probably get a kick out of the show and for that age group alone , i would give it a mild thumbs up . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . reviewed written on : september 2 , 1994 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	screenplay : fran walsh , peter jackson . director : peter jackson . all those who worried that peter jackson's first big studio film would be a sell-out , please step forward to receive your slaps on the wrist . yes , it is true that many independent and international directors have found that their first steps into hollywood left something foul on the bottom of their shoes ( see kevin smith's mallrats , lee tamahori's mulholland falls or john dahl's unforgettable for just the most recent examples ) . jackson's direction is still in top form in the frighteners , a comedy-thriller which , amazingly , works as both . unfortunately , his story and casting choices are not quite up to the task . it's a cozy little arrangement , but it soon becomes clear that there are other supernatural goings on in fairwater . robert zemeckis acted as executive producer of the frighteners , and if you remember his death becomes her , you will have a good idea of what to expect . the visual effects are wild and entertaining , and sometimes decidedly creepy , like an ectoplasmic face which slowly drips down a tombstone . hartman character from full metal jacket as a ghost running a very tight graveyard . the first half of the frighteners is a feast for those with a warped sense of humor , particularly those who have no problem with the idea of the decomposing judge enjoying . . . ummm . . . relations with a mummy in an egyptian museum exhibit . the main problem with the second half , quite surprisingly , turns out _not_ to be the shift from comedy to horror ; in fact , it's not so much a shift as a gradual build-up . bizarre comedy is a part of the frighteners throughout , but the suspense elements become ever more significant , until the conclusion becomes a sometimes rather bloody confrontation between frank and a pair of killers including a wonderfully unhinged dee wallace stone . jackson knows how to make an audience giggle and shiver at the same time , and it all blends into one creepy funhouse ride . no , the problem , quite simply is michael j . fox , or rather the decision to include a sub-plot for which fox is really unsuited . other characters keep telling frank -- and us -- that he is haunted by that event , but fox never manages to make frank seem like anything more than a happily sleazy con man . his attempts at showing emotional turmoil are sadly superficial ; i don't think i've ever seen someone look as thoroughly unconvincing while a glycerine tear rolled down his cheek . the back story for frank is just one of many bits and pieces which jackson and co-writer fran walsh pile onto the frighteners , making it feel like just that -- bits and pieces . with serial killers , gun-toting ghosts , lunatic g-men , snooping reporters and love interests all running around , the frighteners sometimes gets far too busy for its own good . by the time we get to a finale which includes visions of the afterlife ( both the good and bad version ) , it actually seems just plain silly . peter jackson has a welcome quality in a director , which is that he always wants to keep his audience on its toes , never quite knowing what to expect , and he is ready to entertain them any way he knows how . the frighteners is ultimately a satisfying ride which shows that hollywood hasn't shaken the life out of jackson ; now jackson needs to shake some of the loose ends out of his scripts . 
1	completely nude , their bodies intertwine into one in a sexual ballet that director jesse peretz cuts much too short . oozing sex from every pore , she is perfectly cast the film's female lead . sissel is joey's " first , " but sissel seems quite experienced . when joey just turns over the lovemaking to sissel , the picture comes alive with a raw sexual energy that most films are afraid of . ( the sex isn't that explicit , but it is intensely natural . ) ( the locale raises the temperature nicely , providing the steamy atmosphere which filmmakers prefer for filming sex scenes . ) another subplot deals with sissel's many quirks , not the least of which is her obsession with boiling her vinyl records . ( the film is set in the mid-70s , but little is made of the fact and at least one car from the 90s is prominently featured in one of the scenes . ) other parts , such as the rat in the walls , have metaphorical meanings that most viewers will not attempt to figure out . their intimacy and the beauty of their lovemaking saves the picture , even if just barely . it is rated r for sex and nudity , and would be fine for older teenagers . 
2	bound appears to be ripe with all the elements necessary for a top- notch exploitation flick : leather , guns , gangsters , blood , and a couple of hot-to-trot lesbians . from the first scene , however , it's obvious that the writing/directing team of andy and larry wachowski are aiming for something considerably higher than rudimentary titillation . bound is among the best film noir entries of the decade ; from beginning to end , it's solidly entertaining . saying more than that about bound would be unfair , because the plot is loaded with the unexpected . for most thrillers , i'm able to predict the so-called " surprises " far in advance , but this film's well- orchestrated twists kept me off balance . until the final scenes , it's impossible to be sure of anyone or anything . we're never sure who's on the level and who's lying . since the wachowskis don't feel bound by the conventions of the genre , they freely violate our expectations . best of all , everything that transpires in bound makes perfect sense -- the film doesn't demand unreasonable leaps of logic to tie everything together . in that way , it's like blood simple and the last seduction . perhaps the most intriguing departure from the norm is the use of a pair of lesbians as the main characters . ultimately , it's a great choice , both from a plotting and an aesthetic standpoint . jennifer tilly and gina gershon steam up the screen with the kind of eroticism that is rarely found in same-sex or opposite-sex couplings . tilly doesn't have great range , but she can do this kind of role in her sleep . in fact , she's quite intelligent , and that makes her a force to be reckoned with . gershon , who gave one of the better performances in paul verhoeven's trashy t&amp ; a-fest , is excellent here , capturing our sympathy from the first reel . and corky , like violet , is smart . the intended victim of violet and corky's plan , ceasar , isn't dumb , either , and his refusal to act predictably fuels several scenes that are thick with tension . from a stylistic perspective , this is a beautiful film -- a color motion picture with black-and-white sensibilities ( as is often true of the best modern film noir ) . shadows and light are used to good effect . the wachowskis , along with cinematographer bill pope , have crafted a number of artistically superior shots . from the opening moments , ripe with sexual tension , to the closing shot , bound offers an edge-of-the-seat experience . no noir thriller since last year's the usual suspects has captured my attention this fully . if this film was less adeptly-made , it might go down as a " guilty pleasure " , but , considering the amount of skill and intelligence invested in the production , there's nothing remotely shameful about this particular indulgence . -- ingmar bergman 
2	as written by victor hugo , the 19th century classic novel les miserables is a long , sprawling epic that encompasses everything from the political upheaval of post-revolutionary france to the intimate orchestrations of the heart . over the years , millions of fans have come to admire jean valjean , the book's protagonist , who proves that a man can change , and to adore cosette , the one girl who captures his heart . considering the book's length , which easily exceeds 1000 pages ( it is probably the second-longest novel i have ever read ) , there's no way that a 135-minute motion picture can begin to capture its vast scope ( nor , for that matter , can a 3-plus hour popular musical ) . nevertheless , while screenwriter's rafael yglesias makes a host of significant cuts , he manages not only to capture the essence of les miserables' key theme -- redemption -- but also to faithfully render the characters as more than one-dimensional condensations of their literary inspirations . as brought to the screen by neeson , valjean is not only a grand , heroic figure , but a distinctly human individual as well , with frailties aplenty . geoffrey rush , as dislikable here as he was likable as david helfgott in shine , makes javert a memorable villain , but he avoids the obvious temptation of turning the inspector into a cartoonish bad guy . as valjean has his failings , so javert has his virtues , and there are many times when we pity him more than hate him . it's an obsession that blinds javert to all else , and consumes his entire life . none of the supporting actors come close to matching neeson's quiet intensity or rush's zeal . uma thurman is surprisingly effective as fantine , but she's on-screen for less than a quarter of the film . given to overacting her most emotionally-charged scenes , danes seems wrong for the part . hans matheson , playing her love interest , is rather bland , but he is handicapped by an underwritten part . the marius of the movie is a pale shadow of the marius of the book , and the screen version of the love story is far from captivating . marius often seems more like a plot device than a genuine character . directed by bille august , who was once hand-picked by ingmar bergman to helm the best intentions , les miserables is a gloriously rich , if flawed , drama . the two-plus hours fly by as we are captivated by the characters and their circumstances . despite being condensed from a novel that would take 20 hours to present in its entirety , the film rarely has the feel of being rushed . it progresses briskly , but in such a manner that we never lose sight of the two-pronged emotional core of the story : valjean's rivalry with javert and his deep , abiding love for cosette . this is not , of course , the first motion picture version of les miserables , but it is one of the better ones , with a streamlined script that doesn't have the uneven feel of many of its predecessors . there's little doubt that the popularity of the musical made it easier to finance the movie , but anyone expecting singing and dancing will be in for a shock . and , while this version of les miserables lacks the cleverness and contemporary spin evident in claude lelouch's brilliant 1995 re-interpretation , it is moving and effective in its own right , as a more " straightforward " adaptation . kudos to all involved for a finely-crafted period drama that delivers over two hours of solid , literate entertainment . " my belief is that no movie , nothing in life , leaves people neutral . you either leave them up or you leave them down . " -- david puttnam 
2	any traditional version of shakespeare's " richard iii " will open with " now's the winter of our discontent made summer by this son of york " , the first line of one of the bard's best-known soliloquies . this movie , a labor of love for al pacino , who makes his directorial debut , does not intend to present a complete , unabridged version of the text . looking for richard is a condensed version of " richard iii " wrapped in a stream-of-consciousness documentary . i don't think it's a serious concern , however . the primary audience will be shakespeare buffs , and , even if they have seen mckellan's adaptation , they won't mind . besides , the films , despite telling essentially the same story , have vastly different approaches . richard iii translates the play to a 20th century , pseudo- nazi england while looking for richard keeps the original historical context intact but adds a great deal of work-in-progress footage . pacino begins the film as a documentary investigating what modern day audiences think of shakespeare's works . the answers he gets during person-on-the-street interviews are predictable : " it sucks " , " it's boring " , " huh ? " the director's motivation for making the movie is stated up front : " it has always been a dream of mine to communicate how i feel about shakespeare to others . " to do this , pacino interviews numerous actors and scholars . we glimpse the casting process and are given an impromptu history lesson about the war of the roses ( which functions as background material ) . someone in the crew worries that no one knows " richard iii " , but the assertion is made that it's the most often-performed of all of the bard's plays . and , although the documentary portion of looking for richard is largely over at this point , occasional interludes throughout the remainder of the film return to this format . the second half of looking for richard concentrates on performing select scenes from the play . although perhaps only a third of the full text is used , even someone who has never seen " richard iii " should have no problem following what's happening ( pacino's narrative interruptions attempt to explain potentially-confusing issues ) . the unconventional method of filming , which becomes a little wearisome through repetitiveness , must have required extensive time in the editing room . there are lots of quick shots that switch between a full , costumed version of a play and a simple read-through . at times , looking for richard recalls vanya on 42nd street , although this movie makes the behind-the-scenes sequences a more important part of the whole . a number of familiar faces fill roles here . it's worth noting that , while the play sequences appear to have been produced over a relatively short period of time , the entire film has taken years to piece together , as is evident from pacino's constantly changing appearance ( short hair and a beard in one scene , clean-shaven with long , flowing locks in the next ) . although pacino is attempting to make " richard iii " accessible to the " average " movie-goer , he probably doesn't succeed . looking for richard is a fascinating piece of film making , but i don't think it does anything so revolutionary that non-believers will be suddenly converted . pacino's passion is obvious , but it's not universally contagious . however , those who enjoy shakespeare , or are at least open-minded , will find much to appreciate here . looking for richard is unlike any previous adaptation of the bard's work , and that's reason enough to give it a shot . -- ingmar bergman 
0	it's war out there . sometimes it thinks its mission is as a slapstick comedy . the weak script by mark steven johnson and steven bloom succeeds at neither . although its hero , a snowman , cries , the audience is unlikely to shed any tears , and the comedy provides no more than a few modest laughs . a project with a good idea but nothing more , the movie needs a complete rewrite . during the long and dull first half-hour , we are introduced to the characters . you will be wrong . keaton , who is a great comedian , gets lines so lame that even he can't do much with them . the writers think the word " butt " is funny so they proceed to go for the world record for the maximum uses in a single movie . suffice it to say that few of the uses are humorous . with two branches for arms and what looks like a halloween costume of a snowman for the torso , he comes alive . filled with long chase scenes on snowboards and sleds , the movie tries hard to gain some momentum but fails . don't be surprised if you end up thinking of the old samuel goldwyn quote : " why should people go out and pay to see bad movies when they can stay at home and see bad television for nothing ? " why indeed . jack frost is rated pg for sexuality and bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids 8 and up . my son jeffrey , age 9 , was bored stiff . he said he thought the film " stunk , " especially the long , first part . he thought there was nothing to the plot . a normally generous grader , he gave the movie just a single * . 
1	talented mr . " the talented mr . ripley " offers another screen adaptation of the patricia highsmith novel , the first being rene clement's " purple noon ( 59 ) , " a more straight- forward hitchcock type of film that the french actor alain delon couldn't do much with . anthony minghella ( the english patient ) will make the theme of the film into an identity crises problem that ripley has and allow the film to become a character study about a sociopath who can complacently say about himself , " i always thought it would be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody . " he has removed most of the complicated psychological layers of the character and made ripley into a seemingly nicer sort of person , the murder he commits is not premeditated as in the novel but comes about when he is provoked beyond what his fragile nature can take . minghella paints a picturesque view of how these rich americans in the late 1950s live as ugly americans in europe , as the photography is brilliant , with its array of luminous colors , from mediterranean places such as san remo , palermo , roma , and venice . the beautiful scenery , villas , luxurious hotels , and splendid boat rides are just right for getting the audience all excited about taking a look at how the smart-set travel and spend their leisure time . this fits in nicely with the touristy look of the film . but the story , as engrossing as it is , can so easily be forgotten when the film ends . this is a big budget miramax film , not an arthouse personal film . its magnificent look took away any kind of noir intent the novel might have had if the film was done in the pure form it was written in . the film becomes primarily a character study about ripley and not a film that is too concerned about filling all the holes it has in its plot , which are enough to sink a ship . she just seems to be along for the ride- her part is a rather inconsequential one , though it is in the same vein as the tiresome parts she usually stars in , but here we are , at least , spared from seeing tears come down her reddened cheeks . we just see her justifiable petulant anger , as she gives ripley that knowing bitchy look of disapproval , indicating i know what you did to my dickie . ripley's main intent , will be to concentrate on absorbing himself in dickie's personality and to try to ingratiate himself with the womanizing and capricious wastrel- a part that jude does a good job of conveying , as he captures the character's nasty mood swings as well as his goofy flippant side . the scenes with freddie pushed the envelope wide-open and made the average intelligence that ripley possessed diminish in his chilling presence . hoffman's screen presence sparked keen interest in the story and made it seem more powerful when he was onscreen . when he wasn't onscreen , the story wasn't quite as fascinating , which made me wonder if he would have been even more suited to play ripley than the bland damon was . and , even if , there seems to be little sympathy for the idle-rich during ripley's spree , there also becomes less and less sympathy for the psychopathic ripley , who the filmmaker was insidiously trying to get the viewer to identify with . thereby , the film loses touch with the character who falls too far from the graces of any rationality for social acceptance , who is seen drowning in his own lies and trapped in his own guilt-ridden nature . in the novel , ripley is more of a long-range scheming sociopath than he is in the film . the new spontaneous twists in the film changes the mood of the story , and makes it more creepy but not more endearing . i think the reason for that , is because the matt damon part loses the character's rich rebellious flavor and makes him become less an antihero than viewed as a serial murderer . to fully identify with ripley would require the viewer losing himself totally in the character and seeing the world only through ripley's narcissistic eyes , and that is the way minghella probably wanted one to see the film and understand how ripley operated . the problem with that , is it simplified all the dark notions of ripley's character and lightened the burden of the story too much , trying to make it conform with the '90s style of film . as a result , this seductive film comes to a conclusion that failed to live up to the gamesmanship offered throughout most of the story . the film became less meaningful the longer it went on , and it ran for 139- minutes . 
0	this is the first film to go from a super-16 original to hdtv and then to a 35mm negative . it was shown at the 1998 toronto film festival . jay anania's second feature is a very cold , intellectual film that asks the question : can we have a memory of what we only imagined ? this is a mystery puzzler without much emotional impact or much of a payoff . it's imitative in its minimalist style of a robert bresson film . it was intent on saying something , but you would have to be a mind reader to know what it wanted to say . though , she still is not certain if what she envisions is a dream or a memory . to go along with the somber and ridiculously serious tone of the movie , there are moody vocals by judy kuhn . the film's cinematic style is eye-catching and seems to be what the film was all about , but the acting and the story itself felt forced . 
2	( for the record , i found the movie similar in tone and quality to the miniseries , even if the two tell different stories . ) unlike traditional warfare , the drug war has no real beginning or ending and few publicized heroes . if there is an analogy to be made , the drug war is like the endless trench battles in world war i . robert is bored . " i'm angry about a lot of stuff . i'm just not sure what . " helena's all too rapid arc from good to bad is one of the story's few disappointments . the film's large cast , which also includes albert finney , salma hayek , dennis quaid and peter riegert , are well utilized . one almost feels sorry for those actors whom soderbergh didn't invite to be in his film . the movie is surprisingly slow paced for its subject matter and in need of another editing pass to trim off some of the fat . the story itself is fascinating with the notable exception of the unconvincing action of one character towards the end , which plays like a cheap bit of moralizing by the screenwriter . all of the above notwithstanding , what the viewers are most likely to remember a year later is the film's imaginative cinematography . a cool blue , like blue suits reflected off of marble columns , is used for the seats of power in government . even before the characters speak , soderbergh's color scheme alone has already told us much about them . it is rated r for pervasive drug content , strong language , violence and some sexuality and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
1	muriel's wedding presents me with a critical poser : what do you do with a movie when there was only one thing about a movie that you liked , but you liked that one thing a * lot * ? i mean , * really * liked it a lot . muriel's wedding is a truly disjointed effort , bouncing from slapstick comedy to depressing domestic drama , but its lead character is a marvelous creation , played with love and sensitivity by toni collette . i was always interested in what might happen to her , but i was frequently disappointed by what happened around her . does that one great piece outweigh all the other less effective pieces ? in a word , yes . . . but just barely . here is what is right with muriel's wedding : toni collette , who walks the fine line between making muriel sympathetic and making her pathetic . she does the most with her expressive mouth , as her bouts of giddiness cause her to burst into a huge toothy smile , frequently with her tongue stuck out through them . it is a marvelous piece of work , made all the more impressive because she never tries to inject any irony into muriel's decidedly un-liberated dreams . here is what is wrong with muriel's wedding : muriel is stuck in an episodic story which doesn't add up to all that much . then the switch to sydney brings a tragic turn which seems really inappropriate , followed by a bride-for-hire section again focused on comedy . finally , there is yet another tragedy , and a decision by muriel for which the justification doesn't seem quite right . it is often difficult to get caught up in muriel's story , because it takes so many detours . she is also surrounded by characters who are mostly paper-thin by comparison . griffiths has some nice moments as the brassy rhonda , and jeanie dryden has a couple of heart-breaking scenes as muriel's beaten-down-by-life mother . but bill hunter is merely loud and slightly oily as muriel's father , and sophie lee leads a group of stereotypically catty barbie dolls who snub muriel . i can understand the attraction--muriel is a splendidly crafted character , acted with a grace that made me care about her life . she deserved something more cohesive than this jittery wedding . 
1	the film is marvelously acted by anjelica huston , who received an oscar nomination for best actress . it also has a tight script by donald e . westlake . it's a film that doesn't leave you with much to think about afterwards , but while it played its grit and pulp qualities shine in the darkness . the film could have been better served with a more spirited actress than bening , who's best asset is her body . while cusack seemed to not fit what a noir character should be like , as he seemed to be more like a guy who was just trying to be a good grifter . he looked like he would have fit more into a sports film than this one . but the film still works as a modern film noir vehicle , as the script didn't have depth but it provided a full blast of cynicism and shocks that played into the dark plot rather well . if it's a dark , sleazy film , that is well-crafted that you are in the mood for , then this one should be right up your alley . 
1	there will be lots of titty shots and shots from her waist down . but he's much smoother than the bimbo girls and shows them his phony id card while smooth talking them . the problem with this slickly done film , is that everything is only surface deep . we never read the terrorist's mind or get to know much about him or why he does what he does . this is strictly an in-your-face film experience , as the director uribe keeps it at a sensual level and never probes for a possibly deeper story . what this does , is make it a film that was diverting because of the nuanced performances by g ? mez and gabriel . a forgettable film but , nevertheless , an enjoyable one to see . 
0	here's a pop quiz : can you name three things to do to make the time pass more quickly while you're trapped in a theater showing year of the horse ? 2 . take a nice , long nap . unless you're a neil young die-hard , you're likely to find year of the horse unbearable . at the screening i attended , there were more walkouts than i have ever before witnessed at any movie ( including such controversial titles as in the realm of the senses , clean shaven , and kissed ) , and for good reason : this is quite possibly the worst documentary i have ever had the displeasure of watching on the big screen . it's supposed to be a high-energy concert film that captures the intensity and camaraderie of the band members on and off-stage . what it turns out to be , however , is an overlong home movie with bad video and barely-adequate sound . this recipe is repeated eight times . the interviews , which comprise roughly one-quarter of the film's running time , are among the most trite and unenlightening that i've ever heard . jarmusch asks soft , dull questions and receives banal answers . the behind-the-scenes footage that jarmusch cannibalizes from the 1976 and 1986 tours is no more interesting . sadly , the concert footage isn't any more invigorating than the interview material . while extended jams can be enjoyable in person , where the audience forges a rapport with the band , they make for terrible cinematic material , and , coupled with jarmusch's shaky , muddy photography ( accomplished primarily with a hand-held super 8 camera ) , they become lifeless , tedious exercises in chord repetition . unless you worship at the altar of neil young , i urge you to avoid this film . every year , i typically experience one or two movies that i find physically painful to sit through . year of the horse is such a film . what's especially shocking is that it comes from a talented director like jarmusch , who is known for intelligent , thought-provoking pictures . evidently , his feature film making ability doesn't translate into the documentary realm . " for me , the cinema is not a slice of life , but a piece of cake . " 
1	but there will be much more at stake . the bond films keep changing the actors who play blofeld . ( the bond film's usual dramatic opening credits are much more prosaic this time with various shots of twirling and glistening diamonds plus a few mundane dancers -- a big disappointment for those of us fond of its normal high energy and visually attractive beginnings . ) but his heart does not seem in it anymore , and his acting quality in the bond movies decreases dramatically after thunderball . lana wood plays the small part of plenty o'toole -- love those bond film names so full of sexual innuendo . plenty is another of bond's love interests in the movie . easily the most bizarre and out-of-place characters are putter smith as mr . kidd and bruce glover as his sidekick mr . wint . looking and acting like a couple of pseudo-country bumpkins , they seem to have wandered by accident from the adjoining sound stage into the filming of this movie . as a howard hughes type recluse named willard whyte , jimmy dean gives an unusual performance that would have been better cast if the role had been given to a crotchety , older actor . cia agent felix leiter , this time acted by norman burton , does not wear the standard issue , dark spook glasses from previous bond flicks . they never make any sense , but i miss them anyway since they were so deliciously hokey . another gadget changes your voice to sound exactly like someone else's . the movie does have its frivolity , especially in the chase scenes . it is rated pg for a half dozen mild profanities , cartoonish violence and sexual innuendo and would be fine for kids around nine and up . my son jeffrey , almost 9 , complained about the picture's cuss words . he liked the movie but said his favorite of the first 7 bond films is still thunderball . he hated the two stupid characters in this one , mr . kidd and mr . wint . 
2	for more than forty years -- certainly since the 1956 film version of the king and i -- yul brynner has been the king of siam , and the king of siam has been yul brynner . actors often define roles , and roles often define actors ( the latter much to the actors' chagrin ) , but rarely as a role/actor identification been so strong , and so reciprocal . a yul brynner impression without the words " puzzlement " or " et cetera " just isn't a yul brynner impression ; a king of siam without a bald dome just isn't the king of siam . it is the authoritative grace with which chow pulls off that feat that makes anna and the king such an unexpected pleasure . since the story is ultimately an epic romance , nothing is more important to anna and the king's success than the connection between its principal characters . when necessary , he is convincingly aloof and regal , looking and behaving every bit the stern ruler . he also shows a wonderfully light touch , lending a devilish smile to his jabs at anna's strong will . even the more overtly emotional scenes -- clearly meant to pound home the heaviness of the head that wears the crown -- are nicely under-played . those familiar with chow primarily as an action star should take note : his versatility keeps the romantic angle in anna and the king fresh and convincing . he's not quite so lucky with the political angle . the double-dealings are pretty conventional stuff , leading to an exploding bridge climax that feels like it belongs in an entirely different film ( one directed by jan de bont , perhaps ) . in fact , anna and the king stumbles whenever director andy tennant draws too much attention either to finger-wagging at cultural imperialism ( a blowsy british merchant insulting mongkut at a dinner party ) or to his own direction ( an operatically staged beheading ) . even in a film that runs two and a half hours , there's just not enough time to spend away from its complicated central relationship . fortunately , anna and the king is ultimately redeemed by its splendor . no , not the splendor of luciana arrighi's production design or caleb deschanel's cinematography , though both pieces of work are exceptional . it's the splendor of chow yun-fat that carries anna and the king through its occasional stretches of anachronistic anti-colonial posturing and trite palace intrigue . creating the image of a king is a difficult enough task ; re-creating a king who is already an icon would seem to be thankless . chow is nothing less than a presence that takes over anna and the king -- with his humor , his poise , his majesty . . . et cetera , et cetera , et cetera . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1	the film brings up a few interesting points about defending such an unappealing man and how legitimate is the insane plea , which if allowed to be used as a plea could really bog down the justice system with criminals trying to manipulate the system . the filmmaker probably didn't feel confident enough with kensington's testimony in favor of insanity and had winston put on a show for the court to prove he was really nuts . the film for all its soft spots , still had a good but enigmatic performance from mitchum , whose motives for taking on the army bigwigs and putting a dent in his career are never made quite clear . keenan wynn was an appealing loony . the film was interesting enough in spots to hold my attention , but it defeated its own purpose by making general kempton so politically immoral and wynn so nutty , that the film's liberal message can only be viewed as a muddled one . 
2	despite its relatively humble origins , the movie has become a top ten hit in its native country , and , after seeing the picture , it's not hard to understand why . making up is charming . while many of the plot elements in this romantic comedy are staples of hollywood's ventures into the genre , von garnier avoids a number of pitfalls common to typical big-budget american ventures . the female characters are more real than the men and , in a case of turnabout being fair play , it's the males who are reduced to the level of sexual objects while the women have all the good lines . also , the running length is about right for the story . there is no evidence of padding things out ; when the story has been told , the end credits roll . this keeps the pace consistent and energetic . making up has just about everything going for it - strong writing , inventive direction , and believable performances - except originality . the movie is comfortable because its situations , even though presented in a slightly different culture , are familiar . the two main characters have a real chemistry that is rare between two women ( probably because of the dearth of solidly-written female characters ) . making up is peppered with laughs , never taking itself too seriously . the script is as perceptive as it is humorous , investigating such issues as why people are afraid to live their lives alone and how it's easier to hide than confront loneliness . katja von garnier's first movie exhibits a liveliness that dis- tinguishes it from most modern romantic comedies . the best part about the film is its characters , who would be just as absorbing if all they did was sit around and talk - which is most certainly not the case . here , there's a lot of making out as well as making up . 
1	heat is a action movie of great energy and excellent stunts that masquerades as an epic . the plot can easily be summarized as cat chases mouse , mouse chases cat , and cat and mouse stop to share a cup of coffee . it is an intriguing , but exhausting movie where only two aspects ( bad guys and the stunts ) of the movie work . it is an interesting movie with lots of action so most viewers will leave the theater satisfied and yet it has the potential for much more that it delivers . the action sequence here is impressive and the best part is the sound effects - massive steel on steel impact . shades of the die hard series . detective hanna says , " i've got a lot of angst . i preserve it , i hold it , it keeps me sharp where i've got to me . " you do what you do best and try to catch bad guys like me . " several times during the show mccauley reminds us of his guiding principle , " do not get attached to anything you can not walk out on in thirty seconds flat if the heat comes around the corner . " shakespeare this isn't . the movie has many an exhilarating action scene full of great sound effects especially of assault-weapons . sorry to say that since mann believes he is creating something on the scale of the godfather sagas , he pads the movie with numerous and superfluous family scenes . none of them work . the only point the families seem to serve is to say that both good guys and bad guys have families to distract them and that the families on both sides look and act alike . justine complains to her husband that " i may be stoned on grass and prozac , but you've been walking through my life dead . " the robbers are quite well done . the makeup and the costumes add to their aura of evil . the acting by the robbers is excellent . de niro delivers a strong but controlled performance as do kilmer and voight . pacino , on the other hand , loses control emotionally in almost every scene . the script attempts to compensate by giving him a plethora of expletives for adjectives with which to scare the crooks . now we come to believability . this is where the movie earns its lowest scores . let's take a quiz . if someone is firing a stream of bullets from an assault-weapon into your windshield , would drive keep driving straight into him ? if you are surrounded by hundreds of policemen and you have to fired constantly for many minutes , would you never need to reload ? in this case , would you expect to kill scores of police but get away unscathed yourself ? if you are a cop , would you push a guy through a plate glass window to make him talk ? the music is bland - made up mostly of pseudo-haunting violin melodies . the camera work is good and fast paced in the action sequences , but it has too many hyper close-ups in the family scenes . when pacino's nose covers the entire screen at the local monsterplex , you feel like you are viewing mount rushmore . heat runs ( sometime crawls ) 2 : 51 , but there is really only enough material for two hours . it is correctly rated r as it is full of violence with more deaths that you can hope to count . i do not remember any nudity , but there was a little sex . it is suitable only for mature teenagers . i liked all of the bad guys and the stunts are terrific , but ultimately i have to give the movie a mild thumbs down . it gets * * from me . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : december 21 , 1995 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
2	u . s . availability : wide release 6/2/95 running length : 2 : 15 mpaa classification : pg-13 ( mature themes , brief nudity ) theatrical aspect ratio : 1 . 85 : 1 cast against type , clint eastwood plays robert kincaid , the male protagonist in the motion picture adaptation of robert james waller's the bridges of madison county . kincaid is a sensitive loner , and while the actor is certainly known for his portrayal of independently-minded individuals , one would be hard pressed to describe dirty harry as a model of sensitivity . as good as eastwood is , however , it's his co-star , meryl streep , who really shines . the bridges of madison county is a beautiful film , not only in the way it was photographed , but for the manner through which the characters are revealed to us . eastwood will not be hurried , choosing a relaxed pace for the unfolding of this romance . there's a lot of dialogue -- some mundane and some touching on the quintessential aspects of the human experience . the bridges of madison county presents a richly- textured emotional tapestry . it's the kind of movie you know is going to be special before much of the running time has elapsed . in the book , francesca is not an especially strong character -- things happen around her and she's swept up in the current . richard lagravenese's screenplay rectifies this , creating a dynamic personality for streep to work with . in fact , the actress commented that she was " blind to the book's power " but thought the script was " beautifully crafted . " there aren't many intelligent motion picture romances . and , as in that film , there's a profound sense of inevitability permeating the atmosphere , a realization that this magical time must come to an end -- and soon . it's easy to believe that francesca and robert's love is deep and special , but perhaps the real test of the film's power is whether the statements , situations , and characters transcend the screen to leave a lasting impression . not many pictures are created with the necessary skill to challenge our perceptions and beliefs , but the bridges of madison county is a rare exception . 
2	the vanishing is a challenging psychological thriller about a nightmare that comes true and an obsession that leads to bizarre results . it makes the most of its tale by its vivid dream sequences and the masterly holding off of its inevitable findings until its conclusion , as it relies on the viewer becoming overwhelmed with curiosity to hang on until the end . it is a superbly done suspense yarn relating to what lengths someone will go to find out something that he feels he must know about himself , as this tale is told without the usual horror film special effects . it consists of the real everydayness situations , which makes the mystery seem even scarier . the theme of disappearance has been attempted by many great directors , such as hitchcock , in his the lady vanishes , but it has never been done as spookily as it is here and from such a simple storyline . each time he goes to the designated spot of the meeting there is no one there , but he feels the presence of that person . the performances are particularly good , with gene bervoets being made into a victim , becoming a kafkaesque figure , trapped in a world that is not of his making . while johanna ter steege gives the film an inner light that captures the prevailing mood of the mystery . she is so sweet , honest , and endearing , that the continuing curiosity gene shows for what happened to her is very understandable . and , bernard-pierre donnadieu is perfectly credible as a self-absorbed psycho , someone who is devoid of passion , as his crime is not sexually motivated even if he seems to only target pretty woman ( he says that he does so because they don't expect to be victims ) . this film is so well-crafted , that it is easy to get carried away and think that more is being said here than what has transpired . but in the simplicity of its story , it becomes easy to identify with the amsterdam couple and feel caught up in their dreamworld which intermingles with their real-life . a film that is very much in the hitchcock suspense mode , as a real-chiller . 
0	ignore the trailers and the handsome special effects of event horizon , for it is not a science fiction movie . this is an expensive horror film that is pure schlock . it does have a glossy sci-fi wrapper , a la alien , but the quality of the underlying production is a pure b movie exercise in terror . the movie has a talented , but completely wasted cast . why the captain has such a bad attitude is never explained . first-time writer philip eisner's fatuous script includes a stream of inane lines including retreads ( " smoke 'em if you got 'em " ) , overly cute ones ( " you know the rules people . and the brutally obvious ( " what are you telling me ? the crew , which makes some pretty foolish moves later , at least does not miss this floating billboard . the audience gets to witness massive amounts of blood and nauseating special effects . people's bodies explode from within , and in the film's piece de resistance , characters rip out their own eye balls . this slickly produced bad movie has superlative special effects . objects , especially liquids , float in space with a eerie realism . still , the net effect of all of the gore in this disturbing film is apt to leave many movie goers wanting to head for a shower . some pictures , alien and aliens being the best examples , can make an apocalyptic vision fascinating . event horizon , on the other hand , is merely disgusting and watching it is about as much fun as staring at car accidents along the highway . event horizon runs just 1 : 35 but feels like it will never end . the movie is rated r for frequent profanity , massive violence and gratuitous nudity . the show would be acceptable for mature teenagers , but i do not recommend it to anyone . i give it * for the wasted special effects and the talented cast . * * * * = a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = totally and painfully unbearable picture . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	starring : david caruso , nicolas cage , samuel l . jackson , stanley tucci , katherine erbe , ving rhames , helen hunt , michael rapaport director : barbet schroeder producers : barbet schroeder and susan hoffman screenplay : richard price cinematography : luciano tovoli music : trevor jones released by twentieth century fox there are about as many sublassifications in the thriller genre as there are tv talk show hosts . there's the noir thriller ( blood simple ) , the action thriller ( die hard ) , the " cop " thriller ( anything starring clint eastwood ) , the " twist and manipulate the audience " thriller ( basic instinct ) , the " artsy " thriller ( pulp fiction ) , the exploitation thriller ( anything with shannon tweed ) , and the " nothing much happens " thriller . 1995's version of kiss of death ( the script is based on a 1947 screenplay ) deserves placement in the last category . this is the second consecutive lackluster film delivered by reversal of fortune director barbet schroeder . like his last effort , single white female , kiss of death boasts an interesting cast ; lush , atmospheric cinematography ; and a hole-riddled plot . despite a one- hundred minute running time , the movie fails to resolve several obvious hanging threads , and the climax is so weak that the only real clue that the credits are about to roll is a slow pull back and pan by the camera . not unexpectedly , things go badly . kiss of death generally meanders , taking quite a few unnecessary and ultimately pointless detours . the basic storyline probably wouldn't satisfy half the running time , making it necessary to find something to pad out the film . the result is a great deal of running around , meaningless and unconvincing attempts at character and relationship building , and a horribly manipulative " child in jeopardy " scenario . there are the expected double-crosses and revelations , but kiss of death's twists are neither momentous nor surprising . the entire film is rather low-key , which might be an asset if the script wasn't in need of at least one more rewrite . the somber tone and new york setting recall robert deniro's 1992 remake of night and the city , another motion picture that failed to live up to expectations . the acting is very much a mixed bag . kiss of death fits in well amidst the mostly-bland crop of releases clogging theaters this spring . with a theatrical trailer far better than the actual picture , schroeder's film delivers little more than a healthy dose of disappointment . the picture is watchable , but nothing about it will linger , except perhaps the feeling that , with a more polished script , it might have been significantly better . 
2	robert deniro . dustin hoffman . kevin bacon . with a talented cast like this , it's virtually impossible to envision a bad movie , and , in that regard , sleepers doesn't surprise or disappoint . this is easily barry levinson's best effort of the decade , and it helps to erase the bad taste left by his early-'90s mega-flops toys and jimmy hollywood . despite protests from the catholic church ( which whines about any movie that portrays priests as anything less-than-pure ) , sleepers , which represents two and one-half hours of gripping entertainment , is well worth the price of admission . the movie is about revenge and redemption , and how , in america's darkest social corridors and backalleys , the two can be inextricably linked . yet , even though sleepers is basically a vigilante motion picture , it exists on a much higher plane than something like death wish , which offers a least common denominator , visceral satisfaction . there's little thrill in watching the vengeance extracted by the protagonists of this film because sleepers approaches its subject with a conscience . in fact , father bobby's dilemma is arguably the most compelling aspect of sleepers' second half . the film's sluggish final hour is its weakest portion , but there's still enough there to maintain audience interest . we've spent a long time with these characters , and we're not about to abandon them because levinson doesn't move things as smoothly to the climax as we might prefer . like most boys , they're curious about sex , enjoy playing stickball , and have an appetite for pranks . sleepers' provocative script is marred only by an unnecessarily verbose voiceover narrative and the protracted final third . one of the most fascinating aspects of the movie is watching how the law can be manipulated to deliver justice in a manner that was never intended . and , while michael's scheme may be a little too convoluted to be plausible , it's nevertheless entertaining to watch the pieces fall into place . at what point do the demands of basic humanity take precedence over the oaths and responsibilities of the cloth ? much of this struggle is not played out in words , but in bobby's face , and , with an actor of lesser ability than deniro , the emotional resonance of the internal war could have been lost . deniro isn't the only one to turn in a powerful performance . sleepers is as well-acted as it is deftly-crafted . there are those who may be disconcerted by the intensity of the reform school scenes ( nothing overly graphic is shown , but much is implied ) . levinson takes us through every phase of the boys' torture so that , when the time comes , we can understand and sympathize with their need to emulate the hero of their favorite book , the count of monte cristo , and exact decisive retribution . as sleepers opens in theaters , members of the media are trying to determine how much of this film is grounded in reality . ultimately , however , it doesn't make much difference whether the events of sleepers happened or not . the themes and messages are no less valid either way , and , even if it isn't a true story , events like these could have transpired . fact or fiction , this is a memorable motion picture . -- ingmar bergman 
1	screenplay : luc besson and robert mark kamen . director : luc besson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( brief nudity , sexual situations , violence , profanity ) running time : 127 minutes . here , i had thought to myself as i watched a television spot for the fifth element , may be the acme in hyperbolic idiocy . i could only shake my head , especially considering it had only been a few months since we had actually seen star wars for the 90s . then i saw the fifth element , and i was forced to acknowledge that , in a perverse way , the statement was completely accurate . like star wars , the fifth element is essentially a fairy tale , an archetypal good vs . and like many films of the 90s , it's so busy and loud that the compelling elements in the story tend to get lost . whatever else one might say about the fifth element , you have to give this to luc besson : there is nothing he won't try to keep the audience watching . the fifth element is a blitzkrieg of images , moods and messages which never lets up and never gives you a chance to get bored . you've got your good aliens , your bad aliens ( the shape-shifting mercenary mangalores ) , your sex ( enough to push the pg-13 envelope ) , your violence ( ditto ) and your romance , all tied up in a big shiny anti-war message before the finale . if that sounds like a lot to take in , that's only because it is . as undeniably entertaining as individual moments in the fifth element may be , the film never feels like a cohesive narrative with a distinctive sense of place . the most memorable creations of fantasy and science fiction , from the wizard of oz to brazil , created worlds which were not just unique but uniquely real -- every place , character and event were of a piece . besson doesn't create that kind of world , one where you feel transported to somewhere you've never been . there are plenty of vivid details in the fifth element , like dallas' one-room-does-all apartment and an airport filled with garbage , but they don't add up to anything truly intriguing . things happen for the sake of a momentary laugh or gasp rather than for the creation of the film's internal universe . it's not a specific future ; it's the future , impressive but generic . it's nice to have sly performers like willis , oldman and holm on hand to make the fifth element's relentlessness somehow forgivable . milla jovovich also does sharp work as leeloo , doing a riot grrl spin on daryl hannah in splash . indeed , there are enough of the right elements in the fifth element that you can't help but wish that they had been put together better . this is a story about heroes , villains and the battle between good and evil where the hero's quest is unclear , the real villain is given just enough personality to make one threatening phone call , and the climactic battle is over in a literal and figurative flash . the fifth element moves , all right , but it moves frantically , like the wired mugger who accosts dallas in one of the film's more amusing scenes . i kept thinking about how that character might have written the fifth element after an all night bender of jungian mythopoetics and the 23rd century upper-of-choice . 
0	and they're characters in a new romantic comedy . no , this isn't the movie notting hill . not even close . the hopeless and uninvolving script by rafa russo does have shades of notting hill and sliding doors , but director mar ? a ripoll's twice upon a yesterday has a few things lacking -- romance and humor being just two of the missing ingredients . also missing in action are any characters that you care about . and , with the male looking so undesirable , it's hard to see how they could . their love affair doesn't have a genuine moment . the director tries to compensate with dramatic music and artful lighting , but it doesn't help . these artistic tricks actually make it worse since they draw attention to the fundamental lameness of the story . one suspects the film is supposed to be a romantic comedy , but , if so , they forgot to include anything funny . perhaps they should have tried a laugh track along with the dramatic violin music . at least that would have introduced some laughter into this laughless comedy . ultimately the movie asks whether altering the past will enable us to obtain the future we want . a good question perhaps , but this lifeless cast gives us no reason to care about the answer . twice upon a yesterday runs mercifully just 1 : 32 . it is rated r for a little sex , profanity and nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers . 
2	it's an awesome responsibility for these 4 blokes , but in this heartwarming film , these guys are up for their mission . this ground level view of space exploration is actually based on a true story . although there are plenty of laughs in the dish , it is the amazing but simple story of dedication that remains in your memory after you leave the theater . making extensive use of archival footage and audio clips , the movie does a masterful job of transporting us back in time . graeme wood's warm cinematography has the saturated colors of a 1960s tv set . the musical choices are an evocative choice of memorable old pop tunes and moving dramatic pieces . in short , this is a movie that really knows how to set the mood . the writers provide rich stories and back stories for a large number of characters . the wonderment of scientific endeavor hasn't been so well displayed since october sky . what is remarkable about this story is that without these four unsung heroes , july 20 , 1969 would have lost most of its impact . without live pictures , the moonwalk would not have been nearly so dramatic or memorable . but this is a sweetly humorous , not a somberly serious , movie . the film is incorrectly rated pg-13 for brief strong language . i listened hard and don't remember any profanities . the film would clearly be acceptable for all ages , but younger children will likely get fidgety . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
1	every building , it would seem , holds some literary or historical story , and speed knows them all . a fatalistic philosopher , speed has opinions on every subject and many are pretty bizarre . " i think of every double-decker loop as another loop toward my death , " he tells us in one of his more lucid moments . in his environment as a guide to the city , the other star of the movie , speed is elegant and poetic . to be fair , if success means pleasing your customers , speed appears to be a failure . the many shots of his bus audience show them so near boredom that they look like moving zombies . " one of the great tragedies of this experiment of the thing we call civilization is that we have to work , " speed tells us . even if his riders don't appreciate him , he loves every minute he gets on his little stage . the short movie feels longer that it's hour and a quarter length , probably because it has one natural ending scene after another before it finally stops . although the movie is worth seeing , the actual guided tour looks a lot more interesting . the movie is not rated but would probably be pg-13 for mature themes and would be fine for kids around 12 and up . 
2	there was a time during the long history of the adult entertainment industry that porn films showed signs of artistic ambition . during the late '70s , a small cadre of directors believed that they could combine the raunch of real sex with an involving plot . it was a lofty goal , and one that ultimately proved impossible to realize , especially with the advent of video forcing movies to be made cheaper and faster . but boogie nights isn't just an expose of the porn industry -- it's a provocative and involving character study , as well . while it could be argued that anderson has bitten off more than he can chew -- a few too many of the men and women populating his film are left half-developed -- an overambitious approach is always preferable to the alternative , and boogie nights does enough things right that it's easy to overlook its few shortcomings . one of the movie's greatest , and most immediately obvious , assets is its ability to capture the feel and mood of the late '70s and early '80s . at different times throughout the film , anderson uses long , single takes where the camera pans from one character to another , putting the viewer in the midst of a swirl of activity . the director also has a talent for picking just the right songs for each scene , making the soundtrack an integral part of the movie rather than just a jumbled collection of old disco hits . add to that the hairdos , clothing , decor , and attitudes of the era , and you have an effective re- creation of recent history . the first half of the film , which takes place between 1977 and late 1979 , is lively and energetic , with the focus on parties and good times . then , following a pivotal sequence at a 1979/80 new year's eve gathering , boogie nights' tone shifts to something more grim and contentious . the porn industry goes into a downward spiral with mass-market video supplanting carefully-made movies , and the actors and directors are sucked down with it . together , the director and his star seek to elevate the adult film to the next level ( which actually resembles a cheap exploitation action flick ) . dirk isn't the only one under jack's wing . although mark wahlberg has the starring role , and gives the best performance of his still-young career ( although there are still times when he is stiff ) , he is easily overshadowed by two more impressive portrayals . matching reynolds' performance step-by-step is julianne moore , who can add her role in boogie nights to an ever-increasing list of interesting and challenging characters . and porn icon nina hartley gets some mainstream exposure , and even a few lines , as little bill's wife . boogie nights is filled with so many subplots and secondary themes that it would be impossible to recount them all here . all of the men and women populating boogie nights encounter at least one of these elements as they traverse their character arc . boogie nights is a dramatically rich and visually arresting motion picture that has earned ( and is deserving of ) comparisons to the films of robert altman . anderson takes risks with this movie , few of which fall short . ( one of these is the pointed and sure-to-be controversial final shot -- a perfectly conceived and framed statement about the de-humanizing effects of the porn industry . ) the result is a memorably penetrating motion picture . " the cinema is not an art which films life : the cinema is something between art and life . unlike painting and literature , the cinema both gives to life and takes from it . . . " - jean-luc godard 
2	the man who wasn't there , by the acclaimed coen brothers , director and co-writer joel and co-writer ethan , is an exquisite film noir shot on fine grain color stock and printed in gorgeous and expressive black and white . the movie premiered at this year's cannes film festival , where it tied for the best director award . if it can be argued that the coen brothers' pictures are an acquired taste , i guess that most people are still acquiring it . i've liked films of theirs that most others didn't ( the big lebowski ) , hated some that got mixed reviews ( o brother where art thou ) and loved some that just about everybody loved ( fargo ) . he is not only the lead character , ed crane , but also the story's constant narrator , which is handy since ed's a taciturn kind of guy . if a building were in flames , he'd probably stay silent , figuring that , if he waits , someone else will yell , " fire ! " thornton's minimalist performance is perhaps the best piece of acting that he's ever done . every time he appears on the screen , it is as if time freezes . set in the late 1940s , when land yachts still had some class , the movie takes place mainly in interior settings , although the few cruises down the country roads form the film's most impressive visuals . ed doesn't have much ambition , and his only desire in life would probably be for people to stop gabbing so much . with his bad toupee , poorly fitting suit and pudgy body , creighton is not exactly the sort to inspire confidence , but he describes to ed a revolutionary new process called " dry cleaning . " ed's story of the proposal is typical of the script's wonderfully dry sense of humor . " don't you want to get to know me better ? " he asked her . " why ? " needless to say , there are a few complications along the way which lead to a trial . an attorney with a big ego -- " i litigate . i don't capitulate . " -- he is a firm believer in such esoteric defense strategies as employing the heisenberg uncertainty principle , even if he can't ever seem to get the name right . a couple of small subplots add a little variety . another concerns ed's interest in the growth and styling of hair . both add delicate spice to the plot without ever spoiling it . a very quiet movie with little ambient sound , with occasional staccato piano pieces and with the aforementioned stunning cinematography , it allows one to concentrate on the picture's best aspect , billy bob thornton's pensive yet subtly nuanced facial expressions , which alone are worth the price of admission . it is rated r for a scene of violence and would be acceptable for teenagers . my son jeffrey , age 12 , found that this wasn't his cup of tea , giving it just 1/2 of a star . he found the lead character uninteresting and the movie boring . his only positive comment was that some of the comedy was " okay . " just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line . 
0	i have a theory that , in an earlier stage of development , the premise for a simple wish went something like this : murray ( martin short ) , who aspires to being the first male fairy godmother , turns out to be completely inept at the job , but an affirmative action mandate forces the godmothers to admit him . this would be before the real-world affirmative action debate heated up , forcing controversy-shy universal executives to drop that angle entirely . the theory , i'll admit , is based on no evidence in the version of a simple wish which actually made it to the screen . the alternative , unfortunately , is that the story never made a shred of sense at _any_ point in its development . it's the kind of exasperating kiddie fantasy where stuff just happens , without any character , story or internal logic to guide it . of course , the stuff which does happen may be plenty to satisfy young viewers . the special effects are , admittedly , temporarily distracting . martin short , who should be taken only in small doses even on his best days , turns murray into a flinching , snorting and generally annoying creation without a glimmer of charm . mara wilson , who was so appealing in last year's delightful matilda , barely registers here at all , while francis capra registers far too often as wilson's big brother . there is not a single likeable character in the film , turning every scene into a long wait for some kind of goofy visual effect to snap you out of your stupor . all of these problems make the gaping hole at the center of the film all the more evident . a simple wish is based around a high-concept premise -- a male fairy godmother , and an incompetent one at that -- yet not once is there any attempt to explain why he wanted to be a fairy godmother , how he managed to become one , or why no one is keeping an eye on him . in fact , a simple wish is comprised of nothing but missed opportunities and half-developed ideas . does it matter that murray is using a broken wand for much of the film ? time and again , a simple wish wanders from scene to scene as though blissfully unconcerned about arriving at anything resembling a point . then again , maybe someone got cold feet and stripped it of its point . it's more charitable , i think , to imagine the darkly satirical film a simple wish might have been than to dwell on the muddled mess it turned out to be . calling a critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist .

1	anyone remotely familiar with the robin hood legend knows the basic story behind this parody . imagine an amalgamation of the naked gun , robin hood : prince of thieves , and monty python and the holy grail , and you have a pretty good idea what to expect from men in tights . this is a film packed start-to-finish with satire , puns , one-liners , and other assorted visual and audile jokes . nothing is too high-brow or low-brow for mel brooks , although you can bet there are more occurrences of earthy humor than that of the intellectual variety . every opportunity for humor , no matter how feeble or juvenile , is seized upon . there have been several parodies already this year ( loaded weapon one , hot shots : part deux ! , and last action hero come to mind ) , none of which have attained the level of men in tights . that's not to say that this is a masterpiece of any sort , but its jokes are more clever , more original , and more consistently funny than those in the other movies . in a hot shots-type film , the humor gets stale by the end of the first half-hour , and most of the laughs have dried up long before the final credits roll . mel brooks , on the other hand , has enough experience ( not to mention flair ) with this kind of motion picture , that he knows to vary the humor so that the gags don't wear thin before the running time has expired . that's not to say that everything brooks does works . there are a fair share of clunkers in men in tights . but with such a non-stop barrage of jokes , regardless of what percentage work , there's not much time in between laughs . and whether your kind of humor is along the lines of shakespeare or cheech and chong , there's something in this movie sure to provoke laughter . in many ways , this is the mel brooks of old , the same master of humor that brought us classics like young frankenstein and blazing saddles . men in tights is not as original , inventive , or hilarious as those offerings , but it's a reasonable offering and certainly not in the same dubious category as such brooks duds like life stinks . in terms of scope , potential , and execution , this robin hood parody is along the lines of spaceballs , the brooks take-off on star wars . there's a fairly strong element of monty python in this movie . while no one in their right mind would dare put this film on the same level as the holy grail , there are moments in men in tights that the british comedy troupe would be proud of . most notably , perhaps , is the rendition of the musical number , " men in tights , " which bears a passing resemblance to the pythons' " lumberjack song . " in a story that closely parallels the kevin costner account , cary elwes does his best errol flynn imitation--a fine job acting serious and swashbuckling amidst all the silliness around him . as is frequently the case , those with cameos steal the show . dom deluise shows up for one scene doing a superlative lampoon of marlon brando from the godfather . not only does he strike as regal a figure as connery , but he does an excellent job of mimicking the accent . there are so many jokes in this movie that it's difficult to pick out a memorable one or two . among the more subtle ones , i was partial to the " moving mole " on richard lewis' face . nearly every time we see prince john , his rather sizeable mole has moved somewhere else . at one point , the sheriff even feels compelled to mention this . most of the overblown musical numbers are also fun , with obviously-dubbed singing voices and rappers fulfilling the function of a greek chorus . parodies are hard films to do , as the mediocre success of so many recent ones has shown . no matter how ripe a film or genre might be for mocking , unless you know how to do it , there are no guarantees . fortunately for men in tights , mel brooks has been doing this kind of thing for decades . as the ads say , " the legend had it coming " , and this film certainly dishes out all that the merry men can handle--and more . 
1	yi yi , by taiwanese writer and director edward yang , would be translated one one in english . the american distributors have chosen instead the less literal english title of a one and a two , probably because the movie is about the rhythms of life . although voted best picture of the year by one association of film critics , it is hardly that . while certainly not a bad picture , it is a long , meandering one that is rarely compelling . still , with its artistic filming -- most conversations are intriguingly shot from a medium or long distance -- it is easy to see how critics might fall in love with it . the relatively formless , slice-of-life plot follows a large number of characters . while the performances are all genuine , the script has trouble eliciting either tears or laughs from the audience . even though the story isn't all it could be , wei-han yang's cinematography is exemplary from start to finish . most fascinating are the scenes shot through the glass of moving cars . 8-year-old yang-yang ( jonathan chang ) is the film's most indelible character . least successful and more traditional are the canonically comical scenes like the one of kids dropping a water balloon on an unsuspecting passerby . although it has its moments , yi yi is the type of movie that , if rented on tape , would be one that you would likely turn off after half an hour out of sheer lack of interest . on the other hand , with an hour chopped off of its three bloated hours , who knows what might have been ? the potential is there . yi yi runs a very long 2 : 53 . the film is mainly in mandarin with english subtitles . it is not rated but would be an r for language and brief nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers . 
0	a mindless action film that exploits the current news headlines while it presents andy warhol's dictum that , in the future , everybody will be famous for 15 minutes , and adds to that its ludicrous plot revolving around how everyone is enchanted by fame , either wanting to be a celebrity or to gawk at them . it also presents an annoyingly didactic message about violence encouraged by the media for ratings and of criminals getting away with murder because they know how to bend the rules , as its maddening story only worsens with an incoherent finale . there is nothing subtle about this heavy-handed thriller . the good part of the film is its fast-paced street action scenes and the attention grabbing psychopathic villain ( karel roden ) challenging the self-absorbed celebrity ace homicide detective ( de niro ) , which makes for vulgar entertainment . it's a film that has about 15 minutes of fervor to it before it gets grounded into a mixture of sleaze , violence , and heartless melodrama . emil will at one point declare : " i love america ! the only good thing about this arrangement , is that despite its seamly nature , eddie is a dedicated and good cop , and the show does help in catching criminals . other than the action scenes brilliantly filmed by jean yves escoffier , the movie is unappealing . as for the actors : de niro is playing a part he always does very well , showing off his comical gift for quirkiness and endowing his character with a larger than life presentation . burns is his opposite , a bland personality , who doesn't watch tv or seek publicity , and the performance succeeds only in being a bland one , intentional or not . the juiciest part is reserved for roden , who makes the most out of being a scary figure , a sociopath with an unintentionally droll wit . he could be any one of a number of tabloid tv slimy hosts , reminding me most of the ass kissing geraldo rivera . there's not much to this flick , except for the beautiful way its mayhem was filmed . its cynical opinion of the media seemed hypocritical , since this film is just as exploitive and violent as the tabloid tv show it was railing against for the whole two hours of this film . 
2	he has come up with a possible masterpiece , arguably his best film , that overcomes a questionable b-movie plot , to achieve an elegant , memorable , and poetic story . he leaves for work at the sound of the eerie throbbing of the jungle drums , which is only announcing that the sugar syrup is ready to be poured . it is interesting to note , how this 1940s film had a tolerant and respectful attitude to blacks , and even allowed them to be critical of upper-class whites without being rebuffed for it . but the treatment doesn't work . one of the all time greatest scenes in horror movie lore takes place , as betsy takes the sleepwalking jessica through the thick jungle of the sugar cane fields while the howling wind and rustling branches and sound of a conch is being blown to bring to the ceremony the faithful . the ritual voodoo ceremony is done in a deliberate and quietly dignified manner , with the result being hypnotic . the obscure motives of the mother and the nurse , and to who was at fault in paul's marriage , and what role wesley plays in all this , is never cleared up completely by the film but that only makes the story more intriguing . jessica's personality is seen differently through the eyes of others , but since she was a zombie for the whole film , we have no idea what her role was in this indelicate affair . the seemingly innocent betsy , seems clever enough to have thought of a solution to this problem that could benefit her . the natives want the case of the zombie settled , they feel there is enough sadness on the island , as is . the power of the script , is in the telling of a tale about local superstition built around the moral dilemma of what is the christian concept of right and wrong , and by creating an unforgettable and haunting atmosphere that blows away the less than sterling acting by the male leads and the unlikeliehood of the story being totally believable . tourneau's direction for this low-budget film was marvelous , and it was spectacularly shot by roy hunt in its chiaroscuro imagery , bringing to light a film that is both incredible and magical . 
0	if someone was going to make a campy version of casablanca , you'd think they'd at least have the decency to make it fun . unfortunately , other than a couple of very obvious , absurdly over-the-top scenes , this film is just plain boring . aside from observing pamela anderson lee's apparent assets , the only reason to stay awake during barb wire is to see how often it pilfers from the bogart/bergman classic . the characters and setting may be based on the dark horse comic book , but the plot is pure cyberpunk casablanca . but there's a problem -- she and axel were once lovers , and she's never forgiven him for abandoning her in seattle . it's curious that no one thought to credit casablanca script writers julius j . epstein , philip g . epstein , and howard koch for at least " inspiring " the film . then again , for the sake of their reputations , maybe it's better this way . despite being outfitted in leather and spike heels , anderson lee doesn't make for an appealing action star -- the silicon enhancements might have screen presence , but the star doesn't . okay , so she looks good on a motorcycle , but that's about it . her delivery of the requisite quips is awful , and her signature line ( " don't call me babe ! " ) reminds one more of kevin kline's a fish called wanda refrain ( " don't call me stupid ! " ) than anything clint or arnold might ever have uttered . the film makers undoubtedly recognized that they were making a bad film . why else cast such an obviously-untalented actress in the lead role ? what they seemed to be banking on is that barb wire would at least be fun , which it isn't . the element of high camp that makes for enjoyable " good trash " isn't present . bad movies like this often generate small cult followings , and that's about the size of audience the picture deserves . 
2	santosh sivan's brilliant first film , the terrorist , was released in india under the less judgmental title of malli . the point of the movie is to get behind the mind and conscience of an individual willing to die for a cause . the story carefully avoids telling us the cause for which malli fights . played as a mesmerizing enigma by ayesha dharkar , malli is someone about whom you know everything and nothing . the director's background is as a cinematographer , and he lens this picture to stunning effect . malli's round face with its silver-dollar-sized eyes fills frame after frame until you feel that her image might break the edges of the celluloid . her wide eyes hypnotize you with their intensity . water , a universal symbol of purity , turns out to be the movie's most important supporting character . whether a torrential downpour or the gentle water from a shower , the water is always symbolic . the surprise of the movie is that , with its lush scenes of nature , it is more often sweetly touching than frighteningly dramatic . malli isn't what we've come to expect in our depiction of zealots . she is determined to do whatever it takes , and yet she possesses an amazing tenderness for such a hardened killer . as she stares directly into your eyes , you feel her saying something to you , but her precise message to you remains as elusive as the politics to which she has dedicated her life . the director coaxes incredible performances out of even the minor characters . the director's gift for cinematography makes the picture mesmerizing . among the other memorable images are the times he keeps the camera in shallow focus as something important happens in the background . this technique is used to maximum effect as malli's face fills the frame while in the background bouncing lights come toward her . these colorful lights slowly transform into a very blurry image of the vip . these are all intriguing questions . but , the journey up to the assassination is the reward in this unusual , fascinating and brilliant picture by santosh sivan . the film creates instant excitement for the director's next project . the film is in tamil with english subtitles . it is not rated but would be r for violence and would be fine for older teenagers . 
2	the noir look of the film is enhanced by it being shot at the actual location of the incident . this taut , well-told story , is suspenseful in the noir tradition of showing dark shadows and setting a dark mood . the acting is superb , screenwriter richard murphy received an academy award nomination , and elia kazan , in his afterthought comments about the film , mentioned that he wished he played up the corruption part of the story in more detail . 
0	glory daze opens with that question , but the answer they give is less than satisfying . rich kids it seems are so enamored with their pointless partying and hanging out , that they don't want to leave . you , on the other hand , may want to make a fast exit if you accidentally find yourself watching this assemblage of cardboard characters . this movie gives a new meaning to the word boredom . i say how do you explain herpes or the grateful dead ? " the guys are stick figures , but the women's roles are worse - visual wallpaper . the writer of the jerky boys , rich wilkes , takes his first stab at directing with this film , and he also wrote the script . the film is so bad that it borders on self-parody . some of the dialog is kind of cute in the abstract but is leaden in this low energy and never believable film . think of it as animal house on valium . i love my mother , but not as much as you guys think i do . " although the kids in the film spend time in class on such artistic creations as a golden hand holding a cd , their professor seems to be even more unbelievable . nothing , i repeat nothing , happens in the movie . the picture tries sometimes to be mildly offense by using gratuitous bad language and constant drinking . actually , the show is so lame that it is not even effective at being offensive since these scenes are all so false . no more of this palsie walsie stuff . " at the end the movie attempts to come alive with a few shocks . like the rest of the picture it is predictable and an unmitigated disaster . glory daze runs about an hour and a half , but will feel like an eternity . it was not yet rated when i saw it , but i suspect it will get a pg-13 or an r . there is no violence or sex , but there is a little nudity and a fair amount of bad language . the film should would be acceptable for most teenagers although i am not fond of the message it gives , but i strongly recommend that this miserable piece of film making be avoided by all ages . only because it was more boring than painful , do i give it 1/2 of a star . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . 
1	the rugrats movie , being little more than a magnified version of the television series , will undoubtedly be well received by its fans . those who think that movies should be more than extended length television shows will likely be disappointed . and parents of kids younger than 5 or 6 may be shocked to find all the frightening images and gross humor in an inappropriately rated g movie . given the popularity of the series with the preschool set , the audience is likely to be filled with that age group . the very talky picture is only sporadically funny . in the film's first act , the pickles have a new arrival . get it ? dil pickles . the kids in the audience may not get it , but it is one of the few jokes thrown to the adults to keep them awake . she grabs a pacifier and sticks it firmly in the dad's mouth . although filled with bright colors , the film's animation has a cheap two-dimensional look to it as if they did the same slapdash job expected for a kid's television show . the backgrounds are almost always static with only the characters given motion . the reason that another production company , pixar , has deservedly won so much praise for their movies stems first from the imagination of the storyline with the technology being an important second . the rugrats movie fails on both of these measures . the scary story about young kids lost in the wilderness has no more originality than one would find in a weekly , television cartoon series . parents have a right to expect that g-rated movies should , without question or research in advance , be acceptable for all ages . the rugrats movie may find parents of little tykes feeling a need to walk out of the theater . the list of questionable activities for a g-rated movie is long , so i'll just touch on a few of them . to be fair , directors igor kovalyov and norton virgien put a happy gloss on the scary images . even if your kids have long since been anesthetized to violence , there is still the issue of the bathroom , or more precisely the poopy , humor . we have kids peeing in the air to make a rainbow . boys look in their diapers to complain about circumcision . there is a vomit scene , and the movie is filled with defecating baby jokes . one of the characters sums it up well , " hey , this is more fun than picking noses . " and that is exactly what your preschoolers may tell you before the ending credits roll . the rugrats movie runs 1 : 19 . it is inappropriately rated g and would be fine for kids older than 5 or 6 . people older than 10 will find little of interest in the movie . my son jeffrey , age 9 , said that he's always loved the tv show , and this movie has the same activities so he really liked it . 
2	screenplay : david gordon green . director : david gordon green . mpaa rating : unrated ( could be pg-13 for violence , adult themes ) running time : 89 minutes . in david gordon green's haunting feature debut george washington , there is no real story to speak of . actually , it's not accurate to say there's no story in george washington . it's more accurate to say there's no plot , because its story is one of the year's most compelling , even when it occasionally lapses into heavy-handedness . it has become something of a national pastime trying to figure out what's wrong with american teens in the era of columbine , and plenty of films from river's edge to kids and onward have tried to capture the aimlessness , amorality and anarchy of contemporary adolescence . i don't think any one of them has captured the soul of america's confused youth as effectively -- or with as much compassion -- as george washington . if such subject matter sounds like it could turn into pretentious filmmaking , fear not . though green's early slow-motion shots may raise fears that he's trying to make a big statement , he ultimately depends on small statements . his cast of young non-professional actors , often improvising around general story points , finds the truth of these characters in dialogue so casual that its profundity comes as an aftershock . even nasia's occasionally florid voice-over narration feels just right , the attempts of a little girl to convey her worldliness . in its rambling , no-particular-place-to-go rhythm , it's hypnotic viewing . it's also the most beautifully photographed film you're likely to see this year . virtually every scene seems to have been shot in some otherworldly twilight , so golden that they almost hurt the eyes . the rare scenes shot indoors capture the grimness of the characters' domestic lives , and one dark public restroom becomes the film's unique vision of hell . when you're not busy wondering at the naturalistic splendor of the performances , you'll be busy wondering at the carefully constructed splendor of the visuals . george washington's final half hour takes a turn toward other thematic elements , as george attempts to re-define himself after a tragic development . the transition isn't particularly smooth , but green doesn't appear particularly concerned with making his film a smooth experience . indeed , some of his editing and dialogue choices are so off-beat ( like the complete absence of profanity from its teenage characters ) you can't help but just let him carry you wherever he leads . where he's leading is a place hinted at in the film's title , a place where children are forced to look backward for their heroes because there aren't any in their own lives . yes , indeed , george washington does tell a story . if only more films with plots could tell stories like this . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " .
